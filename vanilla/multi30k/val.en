if we are to have a single market surely we should have mutual recognition of the common procedures for testing
it would be absurd to make each member state test separately
if i were to be mischievous i would recommend organic green or one as appropriate substitutes
despite these reservations i hope the general thrust of the report will receive strong support from parliament
mr president allow me to adopt a rather swedish and personal tone
swedish snuff is most certainly not good for you and is not to be confused with any sort of health food 
that would be devastating
these tobacco products are most certainly and without any doubt harmful to health
the fact that snuff is less dangerous to people who use it is in actual fact less important
passive smoking is probably the most insidious effect of tobacco
we can experience this on a daily basis both in this assembly and in this house too
there is smoking going on everywhere something which sometimes causes acute difficulty in breathing for those who are allergic to smoke among fellow members of parliament too
one ought not perhaps to refer to one s own experience in this assembly but i myself took up smoking when i was very young
at that time it was not only cool to smoke but it was even useful
rather tubby young ladies in particular were extremely well served by cigarettes
fifteen years ago my husband contracted a serious lung disease
i now regard myself as a nicotine addict but i am not bothering anyone else
it is our duty to provide proper and adequate information on what smoking does to your health
we would also like to have a positive list of additives
however i should like mr president to touch on what i consider to be another important matter
mr president   eu citizens die each year from smoking  that is   a day
it is important that we fight delaying tactics today
the eu already regulates health warnings and tar yields
smokers also have a right to know that there are more than  additives licensed for use in tobacco products
they have a right to know that light and mild branding is misleading
people inhale more if they have a light cigarette than any other cigarette
the health warning should be large and explicit
we must warn of the dangers of smoking the dangers of lung cancer and also the danger of bronchitis and asthma
we must warn of the dangers of passive smoking
i know the dangers of smoking and the dangers of passive smoking
i started smoking when i was  years old
i ended up smoking  a day
my health has been damaged by smoking
there was no warning when i took up smoking
maybe i would not have taken it up if there had been
now i am the victim of passive smoking
i have asthma attack after asthma attack
i am a good example of why we should adopt this report now
mr president ladies and gentlemen smoking is unhealthy and smokers should be aware of this
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on the dynamism and perseverance he has displayed in this connection
the european union too should know that smoking is unhealthy
in fact it should put its money where its mouth is
we have to attach clear health requirements to the goods within the internal market
it is not just the tar and nicotine yields which are at issue here but also mainly additives
additives which encourage addiction should be banned at the earliest opportunity as far as i am concerned
the other aspect of the union policy is the issue of tobacco subsidies
smoking is unhealthy
we are all agreed on this but should we be sharing this with the entire world
this is one of the most interesting and principle questions in today s debate
it would be a considerable change in policy if we were to impose european standards on other countries
if this change were extended to other fields it could mean that european companies would only produce for the european market
the question is whether we want this
to impose standards on other countries can come across as presumptuous moralistic or patronising
after all other countries can set their own standards which industry has to comply with
in this way we would at least avoid other countries especially thirdworld countries being lumbered with secondrate cigarettes
what strikes me in the debate is that we seem to overlook the objective of this directive
it aims to reinforce the internal market by promoting better harmonisation and by removing barriers to trade
i take exception to the fact that the consumer is considered as someone who cannot judge for himself what he should or should not do
the proposed warnings on the packet completely miss the point
whatever the dimensions the information will remain ineffective
information on the dangers of smoking will need to be conveyed in a more effective way if we want to achieve the objective
in this respect i congratulate mr maaten on his work
nevertheless we cannot put the cart before the horse if we want this work to succeed
the reality is that europe produces and exports tobacco and furthermore its cultivation is subject to significant subsidies
as has been pointed out this does not just involve the interests of the large multinationals
it involves the legitimate and fair way of life of hundreds of modest families
if we wish to prohibit these subsidies let us prohibit them but not without truly seeking alternatives which are proven to be viable
in this respect a proposal of time limits may seem logical
however we cannot deny or forget the authority of each state to manage the risks within its own society
i find it sad that there are meps who are trying to weaken the commission s proposal
i am thinking for instance of the discussion about the legal base
in my opinion this is a ridiculous discussion
in my opinion what is at issue here is an unnecessary impairment of public health
under those conditions i simply do not think that we can allow ourselves to export more cigarettes which are a danger to health
i could live with a compromise in the form of the year  but i could not compromise any further on this point
mr president tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of ill health and premature death throughout most of the world
in scotland which i represent one in five people will die of smokingrelated diseases
we have an opportunity of doing something about that this week
we must pass this report into law and thus save lives
the reality that smoking kills is not getting across at the moment
we need a bigger bolder and clearer health message to make smokers more aware
if the size of the health warning directly reflected the risk to health the label would cover the whole cigarette packet
however lowfat yoghurt does not rot your teeth blacken your lungs or put you on a ventilator
the result proved that larger warning messages better encouraged smokers to stop
adoption of the directive would open the possibility for the improvement of health for millions
we have the opportunity and responsibility to act positively on this today
i believe that nobody can rationally oppose this
if we are going to harmonise let us harmonise and not be fainthearted about it within the technological possibilities which may be available to us
why not simply talk about the processing of tobacco
why not talk about this processing
there is no way that i can accept this request for the removal of aid to tobacco
however this harmonisation directive should be restricted to harmonising
one is in the letters page and is headed tobacco proposal would be a slap in the face for workers
that is a comment from one of the leading trade unions in germany
the final point i would make is a little plea to the commissioner
if his support cannot be strong it can at least be mild
we cannot therefore include the idea of eliminating production subsidies even as an aim in the recitals
it is only in this context that there would be any point in providing incentives to our tobacco growers to change the type of crop they grow
moreover we cannot disregard the concerns which weaken the solution adopted in the area of production for export
in conclusion the moral principle is acceptable but the solution is unsatisfactory
we have a duty to take action
the problems will not however be solved by adopting puritanical positions and eliminating aid to producers
reducing consumption will cause a decrease in production
health problems will not be solved tomorrow by importing  of our tobacco
unlike in the european parliament all the councillors smoked like chimneys during committee meetings
this is just to emphasise the fact that passive smoking is harmful for everyone even members of the european parliament
i totally agree with mr martinez who spoke earlier
i support anyone who protects health
i am in favour of this report but i do not agree with its hypocrisy
we must be more courageous
mr president the european union spends eur  billion each year subsidising tobacco production  eur  billion
that kills over  eu citizens  half a million of our citizens
it would be cheaper to go out and shoot them
it would save money on health services
as you have gathered i am an intolerant nonsmoker
i do care and i am extremely concerned about the increasing number of people particularly young girls who are starting to smoke
that is my plea
can we not get the marketing message to them
we would have to protect the tobacco farmers
there would have to be alternatives but surely it can be done
it is immoral to spend eu taxpayers money on subsidising a product that kills half a million of our people
we must find alternatives
we must correct that anomaly
in my country nicotine replacement therapy is only available by medical prescription
madness
what is the difference
the state should fund it
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur mr maaten for his valuable work
plenary should adopt the report in the form presented in that committee
the fact is that tobacco kills
anyone who claims otherwise is either completely ignorant or for one reason or another a puppet of the tobacco industry
everyone knows that we cannot change the centuries old tobacco culture merely through legislation
we have to fight the tobacco companies using their own weapons
for many smoking is not a question of choice or pleasure
tobacco gets you in its grip just like any other drug on account of the fact that it contains nicotine
this will also be important in the prevention of harm caused by passive smoking
in future greater consideration should also be given in eu legislation to the rights of nonsmokers who suffer from the effects of tobacco smoke
this is not the way to solve the problem of smoking
on the contrary we need to engage in an antismoking campaign
consequently i shall not vote in favour of this proposal
we must not create unemployment and underemployment in poor regions of the european union
now we want to repeal them
it is wrong we need to be consistent and coherent
it proposes reducing the level of tar in cigarettes their main carcinogenic component
i am aware that some in parliament would prefer to ban such descriptions immediately
however i do not consider that this is appropriate
the amendments proposed in this report are of a very high quality
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur mr maaten for the contribution he has made in preparing these amendments in such a positive and constructive manner
i should now like to set out the commission s position on the amendments proposed
a total of  amendments have been proposed in this report
of these i am pleased to inform you the commission can accept  either totally or partially
it cannot however accept amendments nos          or 
the accepted amendments include the proposal to increase the size of labels
banning certain additives is premature until further information on their use and effects is available
in this connection the cooperation of the tobacco industry will be essential
we need to bring their experience and knowledge of the tobacco products sector into the process of regulation and revision
i should now like to turn to the other  amendments submitted last thursday
of these the commission can accept a further   either totally or in part
in particular i would mention that this proposal is a recasting of three existing internal market directives
this extension must also be viewed in conjunction with the upcoming who negotiations of a framework convention on tobacco control
this convention aims to put in place worldwide tobacco product standards
unfortunately it is not possible to introduce immediate harmonisation of additives as some in parliament would like
in order to ensure a full and detailed report the proposal envisages a declaration of these additives by the manufacturers and importers
this is a necessary first step before we can go any further
it would be premature at this stage to introduce bans on particular substances
consumers of all tobacco products regardless of their age or social class must be informed on an appropriate basis
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
accidental or deliberate marine pollution
mr president marine pollution accidental and deliberate is one of the major threats to the marine environment in western europe
the region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world
there are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying other forms of dangerous cargoes
the recent example of the erika shows what can happen from an environmental human and economic point of view
it is a catastrophe
however it must be said that there have been a number of incidents
in  a cobalt  source was lost in the north sea never to be found again
in  the mont louis sank in the english channel with  tonnes of uranium hexafluoride
also in relation to releases into the sea in  sellafield leaked highlevel waste into the sea
in  there was a leak into the sea at hinkley point
in   cubic metres of radioactive water was released into the sea at wylfa
historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste
however the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and sometimes comes back to haunt us with severe consequences
this report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution
in terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is irrelevant
effective mitigation requires a rapid response the longer an accident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact
hence it is too late to start trying to get information after a serious pollution problem has occurred
the public s trust in the authorities is important to ensure adequate response
such information can easily be made available and updated on the internet as well as through established channels
finally once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage
the erika is a good example of that
this is a prerequisite in the necessary information sharing with all parties
in january this parliament adopted a resolution following the oil pollution related to the sinking of the erika
what is the situation today
implications for the environment and for animal life have been tragic and there are still serious threats
this proves once again that the principle of polluter pays is not being applied
this would therefore make it possible to include illegal degassing and any other source of pollution
we must also stress the importance of research
this winter on the atlantic coasts of france effective techniques to combat the oil slick in brittany were seriously lacking
cooperation and the exchange of knowhow must be encouraged and supported in this highly technical field
there are international conventions on the mediterranean and the baltic which already fulfil this purpose
on the same grounds i do not think there is any point in providing for a management committee
mr president first of all i too should like to thank mrs mckenna for the work she has done on this matter as rapporteur
sometimes the pollution occurs by accident sometimes through indefensible conduct and at other times through the deliberate actions of a variety of individuals and companies
i am able to support the report with the amendments that have been tabled and i shall only single out a few of the latter
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to say a few words on accidents at sea
it is also often the case that cargo goes overboard
either way the marine environment is polluted
a far greater contribution would be if a piece of eu legislation governing environmental liability with regard to dangerous cargo were to be laid down
unfortunately we still only have a communication and a white paper not a bill
according to european commission officials radioactive cargo is implicitly covered in the text
i would invite commissioner wallstrom to take a stand on this issue explicitly so
let us as a european parliament have the courage to include radioactivity explicitly in the text too
there is a wellknown dutch expression goed voorbeeld doet goed volgen example is better than precept which captures the above
it is scandalous moreover than no serious penalty has yet been considered following the wreck of the erika
the european union will have to take action on this issue to and work towards establishing international standards
the mckenna report represents a move in the right direction and we shall therefore vote in favour of it
france did not have enough antipollution vessels to deal with this oil slick
fortunately the british germans dutch and norwegians spontaneously came to our assistance
this goes to show that it is time to establish a new regulatory framework in order to optimise this cooperation enabling reciprocal assistance
we therefore agree with the philosophy behind this report
stress must be placed on transparency with regard to the public particularly in the event of health risks related to the nature of the pollutant
it is inconceivable that the risk of cancer should be kept from volunteers as was the case in the erika disaster
we are also in favour of extending the definition of accidental marine pollution to include radioactive pollution arms and degassing
we think that extending cooperation to neighbouring maritime countries is a good idea
the sea is our international heritage and protecting it is a matter for international responsibility
recognition of the principle of polluter pays is essential
at the present time the owner of the potentially polluting products is not held accountable for the pollution
in practice only the carrier is accused
this is not acceptable and our hope is that the member states will ensure that the principle of economic responsibility extended to the owners of the cargoes will be applied
the proposed budget of eur  million is in our opinion however much too little to fulfil these objectives properly
i welcome ms mckenna s report
i would like to pay tribute to her for her work
but the real question is how we implement the legislation and what sort of action we take
i believe this is an issue which should be tabled for discussion at the forthcoming igc
let us not miss the opportunity which this report affords
the problems caused six months ago by the erika for example have still not been even partially solved
apparently nothing has yet been solved and this is the lesson we must learn from this disaster
we are aware moreover that containers loaded with radioactive materials are sailing the seas from the hague to japan
mrs mckenna s report offers us an opportunity to include radioactive substances
let us please ladies and gentlemen not hesitate for even a moment
let us avoid a disaster and vote in favour of the amendment to include nuclear substances
mr president there is an important meeting on  june of the ospar commission in copenhagen
this will include the cessation of nuclear reprocessing and associated activities at the sellafield and thorp plants
this in turn will play a key role in reducing marine pollution in the irish sea
i would like to compliment mrs mckenna on her excellent report
this report proposes a range of different measures for improving the safety of marine transport
even if the best preventive measures are taken there will never be no risk at all of accidents
we therefore also need to improve cooperation within the eu when an accident does in fact occur
we require an effective framework of cooperation as a way of supporting and supplementing the measures taken by the member states and of making these measures still more effective
following the first reading of this proposal in parliament the commission approved or reformulated  of the  amendments you proposed
the council has included most of these amendments in its common position
where the amendments tabled for the second reading are concerned the commission is able wholly or in part to approve seven of these
amendment  acknowledges the important role played by nongovernmental environmental organisations in this area
parts of amendments   and  make the scope of the directive clear
amendment  introduces an important reference to the polluterpays principle
naturally radioactive substances too are included in and covered by the cooperation elucidated here in this proposal
the commission cannot therefore approve these amendments
so what kind of protection is there
there are two directives and an information system used in the event of accidents involving radioactive substances
there is directive euratom on the establishment of basic safety standards
the ecurie system is a system for the rapid exchange of information in the event of a possible radiation accident
it is a system which operates  hours a day
we therefore already have a number of different tools and regulations which have bearing upon a possible accident involving a ship carrying radioactive materials
several amendments namely          and  deal with the question of dumped ammunition
on this issue the commission supported the european parliament at first reading
the commission nonetheless believes that the text of the common position constitutes a reasonable solution
it is only because i insisted on it that a reference was finally introduced in article b of the common position
amendments  and  introduce a definition of accidental marine pollution
amendments  and  cannot therefore be approved
amendment  and parts of amendment  are aimed at improved cooperation with those countries which participate in the phare tacis and meda programmes
enlarging the proposed framework for cooperation would unfortunately lead to a number of administrative and resource problems
the commission considers that the common position constitutes an acceptable way of meeting these justified requirements
to summarise the commission can accept amendments   and  in full and amendments    and  in part
other amendments cannot be approved
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
substances that deplete the ozone layer
we also know how we can escape from this problem
it sounds like an easy equation but it is unfortunately more complicated than that
there are so many interested parties involved in a question like this
our task has been to produce an acceptable plan for the way development should look
at second reading parliament adopted ten amendments to the council s common position
the council was able to accept seven of these amendments without any problems
the first amendment concerns hcfcs in certain forms of air conditioning equipment which parliament had proposed should be removed
these were reintroduced as a result of our negotiations but with a stricter phasingout date
in the negotiations we agreed to postpone the phasingout until  by means of a review clause
there are nonetheless still three outstanding problems
at the final stage three mistakes were discovered in the proposed wording of the act
moreover the text relating to certain companies imports of cfcs contained a wrong base year
i want to conclude by thanking the commission and the portuguese presidency as well as parliament s conciliation committee for their extremely constructive cooperation
i believe we have found a compromise of benefit to all parties
it will not repair the hole in the ozone layer but it is a step in the right direction
mr president ladies and gentlemen the first warning call about the reduction in the ozone layer was sounded in 
it has therefore been held up as exemplary
this is extremely worrying
the production and sales of compounds that attack the ozone in the atmosphere s upper layers have in fact decreased since 
whilst there may still be doubts as to the scale of these changes there can be no doubt in the case of ozone
saving the ozone layer is crucial to saving the lives of human beings plants and biodiversity itself
we have both worked hard to find compromises and to ensure that we obtain effective environmental legislation in this area
i should also like to respond to the question put earlier
i shall reply in english
thank you commissioner liikanen
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
digital television in the european union
mr president it is an absolute thrill for me to be able to start this debate in the absence of the rapporteur
i wanted to begin by extending warm thanks to her for the excellent cooperation and the sterling work she has done
this is still the case of course
but i am still sorry that she is unable to attend
this is one of europe s great opportunities but digital television also plays an important role
there is enormous potential there too provided we meet three preconditions which i will briefly outline for you
my first precondition is that we need to do more in the field of standardisation and interoperability
we need to avoid this at all costs
this is a step in the right direction
it has to come from the industry
i think that we can guide this process along to some extent but the initiative has to come from the industry
but if the industry cannot achieve an open standard or interoperability the politicians can and must speak out
a solution must then be found on a political plane as a last resort
my second remark concerns open access
it is also a cultural europe
this is why i think that the amendment tabled by mrs thors with regard to her own report is sound
finally it is absolutely vital that the directive on television without frontiers be reviewed
i want to thank mr van velzen for his work in introducing the debate during my absence
i think it is important that we remember how matters stood when the directive was adopted
not only must it be possible to use different types of technical apparatus in combination with one another but different computer programs must also be required to understand each other
it is therefore important that we should have an api an applications programme interface which can be used as part of this integrated environment
this is also crucial when it comes to the electronic program guides
it is these two factors which the forthcoming provisions should especially concentrate on
neither the decoders operating systems nor the electronic program values are at present mutually compatible
the rapporteur s conclusion is that open standards are now needed
we are now seeing the second and third generation of equipment for digital television
there are good reasons for accepting that this standard will form a basis for the future
digital tv is distributed in a number of different ways which are technically not quite the same
like traditional tv digital tv can be broadcast across terrestrial networks by cable and via satellite
these distribution systems at present have different degrees of penetration but satellite distribution is the dominant system
tomorrow distribution by cable may however gain ground
with distribution by cable there is an inbuilt return channel which provides direct access to interactive services on the network
no one has yet been able to define under which conditions analogue broadcasts can cease
in the background are issues of copyright
as such this means of communication will grant many more europeans access to all kinds of information
it is therefore of utmost importance that a favourable investment climate be created for digital television within europe
after all we are at the dawn of a new era
traditional boundaries between telecom companies entertainment industry and journalistic media are becoming increasingly blurred
these industries are being replaced by multinational cable media giants which are created by mergers
this is a pattern which is emerging throughout the industry
infrastructure and content industry are coming together
this means that two aspects should be monitored effectively
firstly we should look out for unwanted media concentrations because otherwise consumer prices will as yet spiral out of control
in this respect technological developments naturally affect the legislative framework and vice versa
we have noticed that in many member states media policy in particular is still all too often being adopted at national level
this is an unwanted development
it should be possible for all citizens to subscribe to television services from another member state
this means digital television but also television without frontiers
i said i am going to speak on the thors report
but what is this thors report
can i see what my pension will amount to when i retire
of course mrs boroni this is the future the future of the citizens there are no more barriers
you will even be able to see what is happening in the pension companies of other states
but i have to live on   lira a month said mrs boroni how will i be able to afford this television of the future
i wish to mention one or two problems connected with this issue
firstly i support the open standard and compatibility that is only sensible
competition alone does not guarantee it
this is a big issue and it relates to access
in general i support the notion that technical systems are not neutral
they make some things possible more than others
thus for example the ease of availability of interactive services  which the previous speaker was perhaps speaking about in a way  is a political question
in any case we should place greater emphasis on actions aimed at implementation
we need a flexible approach in order to regulate the economic situations which are going through a period of deeprooted change
the regulation of the market must not hamper its development and in particular the development of new television services
these are crucial issues for us requiring the utmost flexibility on our part
today we are coming to realise that it enables vast flexibility and quantity
it was certainly important to sum up the situation regarding digital television at the present time
it is a focused report
i should like to conclude by making a link to the next debate on electronic communications
they can pay for a sports event with interaction to be able to choose the sort of format that they want
they will have different forms of competition
mr president i wish to begin by thanking mrs thors for her excellent work
the commission welcomes this report
it raises the need for a balanced approach to regulation
the new regulatory framework will provide regulators with much greater flexibility to achieve this balance
the directives that the commission will propose this month take account of the three key points raised in mrs thors report
first the need to update ex ante regulations for digital television
the new framework will allow regulators to address new gateways such as applications programme interface
the commission will address these issues in its upcoming legislative proposals
third the need for increased interoperability between different television platforms
more specifically the report singles out two key elements
the commission prefers an industryled approach rather than imposing standards
we have reserve powers to intervene if the market actors cannot agree
however the market is developing open standards
in dynamic markets the standardisation process lags behind the leading edge of technology
the use of open standards reduces both regulation and the number of competition cases
the report signals this clear message to the market place very strongly
i fully support this
the report also raises several issues which lie on the content side and are therefore outside the scope of the new framework for electronic communications
as far as possible we must separate the network and content regulation
the reception of encrypted digital television services across borders raises several difficult issues
even digital freetoair services are being encrypted
this creates tensions with single market principles for paytv services
differing approaches to content regulation may also play a role
but here i need to reflect on this with my colleagues mrs reding and mr bolkestein who have particular competence in this field
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
electronic communications and associated services
mr president i would like to start by thanking those i have worked alongside
a rapporteur without such sound qualitative input is only a small cog in a big machine
we have been able to establish a sound dialogue which is what is important at the end of the day
this is completely new
there will of course always be sectorspecific regulation but eventually we need to move in the direction of competition as a guiding principle
i honestly hope that the commission will move further in the direction we have proposed
the markets are moving extremely fast the developments transcend national borders
we are witnessing all kinds of vertical and horizontal integrations
we can see intersectoral movement which means that each time we need to examine one particular sector within the market
mr president my third point is that you also need to consider the supervisory structures which are in place
it will of course not be the case that in five years time we will still have  telecomict markets in europe
as far as this is concerned we will need to grow towards one european internal market
this also means that i can see two developments in this field which cause me some concern
we also need to ask ourselves how long we need to continue the specific sector supervision
mr president auctions should also come under close scrutiny
mr president another important point is  caller location
if something happens to me it should be possible to trace me immediately
this is why this caller location facility is so vital
but it is also important to combat the abuse of 
in addition it is also of great importance in my view certainly in the case of thirdgeneration mobiles to offer the caller location facility
this does mean however that the user should grant permission to set this up
mr president a serious problem is the democratic hole within the entire ict sector
once we have completed  or  directives in the foreseeable future we as european parliament will have outlived our mandate in this field
at the same time the commission will carry on with the cocom communications committee the council delegation
mr president surely it should not be the case that parliament could be sidelined in this day and age
mr president we have now reached the stage where at the end of this month the european commission will produce the directives
i have thanked the commissioner
that is democracy
mr president i would like to thank my colleague mr van velzen for his excellent work in handling the commission s communication
he has done an enormous amount of work on the amendments to reach a compromise
the liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years in europe
regional differences are still too great however for us to be able to speak of a free telecommunications market
every eurocitizen must be afforded the opportunity to use all communications services at a fair price
the commission must give assurances that these obstacles to competition are removed as promptly as possible
we cannot however simply concentrate on wireless communications
the situation regarding competition in the fixed networks must also be radically improved
the monopoly status the telephone companies enjoy must be destroyed right down to the last copper wire
otherwise people living in remote areas in particular will be at a disadvantage
the question of the distribution of the umts frequencies is a matter that should not be regulated at community level
arguments could be put forward in favour of both spectrum auctions and socalled beauty contests
the fact is that the astronomical prices that result from spectrum auctions always end up with consumers having to foot the bill
beauty contests are in many respects more consumeroriented and more of an alternative that supports the freeing up of the market
unlike spectrum auctions beauty contests do not involve operators having to pay a sum of money that is in the nature of a paye tax
i hope that i will receive unambiguous answers to these questions
i can applaud as always his comprehension of the need to regulate but with carefully argued parameters
it is good too that mr van velzen s report has a clear appreciation of what the convergence of various technologies means
where we have not guessed correctly we have been able to put things right
this is why this report is so important
it lays the groundwork for the future development of the commission s plans and parliament s response for this industry
we ought to take great care not to introduce rules that limit growth in this startlingly versatile market
nor do we want to enter into a situation where mobiles are excluded and other forms of telecommunications are included
finally i would like to draw attention to amendments nos  and 
we still have  partially liberalised and still largely segmented markets
what we have here is the basis for opening up the european union market in a genuine sense
mr president commissioner rapporteur it is a valuable piece of work which mr van velzen has carried out
on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party i want to point out that we support the original report
that is not being technologyneutral
we do not think that this would be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity
there is no reason for requiring a merger in this context
what is more we have a very great variety of solutions in different member states
we are indeed dealing with a market
that much is certain everything is moving in that direction
it remains to be seen however what sort of a society we are dealing with
may we hope for some consistency on this
next what form can a universal service take nowadays
what undertakings must europe and the member states set themselves in this regard
affordable access to all communication services is not enough to guarantee a universal service
this brings me to the matter of content
it might be feared that our reintroducing this question could be taken for an automatic reflex on our part
at the present time  of the world s  most visited web sites are american
is it however possible that the matter has become urgent today
it is only a start but let us not forget that we also have the task of building a cultural europe
i would like to focus on a few points relating to this important report
the union must keep pace with the technological changes which are taking place globally at this time
in many ways the union is ahead of the united states of america in the field of technology
eutechnology in mobilephone systems is well advanced
most union countries have extensive competition in the field of mobilephone markets
the european union is behind the united states of america with the internet
the commissioner has started this process of looking into mechanisms to guarantee consumer protection
in conclusion in my own country of ireland there are  software firms employing over  people
mr president today we are looking into a new legislative framework for the communications infrastructure
this sector however not only needs regulation at european level above all it needs regulation on a global scale
these rules require the necessary flexibility as rapporteur van velzen pointed out with good reason
after all it is unclear what the future holds for that sector
the drafting of preconditions requires attention to both the supply and demand side of the communications market
fair competition is vital to suppliers
accordingly our preconditions should in any event create equal access to national frequencies and infrastructures
preconditions are important to consumers too
a new social chasm between consumers who take part in the information society and those who do not is undesirable
however this sector is not just about access for everyone and as much freedom as possible for the consumer
it is not enough to optimise the customer s freedom of choice by providing information on the services on offer
the commission s current stance against child pornography and racism are good examples of this
however there is a need for standards which apply universally and worldwide
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to congratulate mr van velzen on his work
the new legislation should affect all the communications infrastructures and related services by means of recommendations and codes of conduct and other vehicles
the commission will have to be careful not to create inequalities between the different national product and service markets
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to congratulate our rapporteur on the report which he has presented to us
the communist party of greece is fundamentally opposed to such policies
even yesterday s competitors are coming to private agreements and arrangements thereby adulterating the competition
the important thing about this debate is that by and large there is a strong consensus towards that
our colleague mr alyssandrakis does not agree with that  and it is always good to have his distinctive contribution to our debates
but mr van velzen has quite rightly focussed on some of the difficulties in making that transition and how it is going to be regulated
the second issue on which there is important consensus is that we do not want a centralised regulatory body at europeanunion level
my final point concerns the question of universal service which has already been mentioned earlier
everything we are talking about shows how fast the market is changing
the value added the commercial potential of every connection is going up all the time
it is right to keep that under review and not to make a significant change at the moment
we need an analysis of the situation as a whole from the commission
i too believe that we can expect one as the commissioner has looked long and hard at the matter
in my opinion the digital divide has already happened
then there is the universal service about which my learned colleague mr harbour spoke
perhaps there is no need to define it but it should be returned to as this concept is constantly evolving
we are always having to return to the matter of the universal service as it must be made available
it may involve for example hospital services consultation services and other important services of this type
i want to say one last word on spectrum auctions
of course no one can disagree with this objective and i am in favour of it myself
let me add four points which i consider are important to this debate
firstly regarding the principle of competition i could never accept this being considered an end in itself
secondly regarding monitoring i am not in favour of subjecting national regulatory authorities to outside supervision
thirdly regarding the allocation of the frequencies necessary for umts licences i think this must remain within the remit of the member states
mr president i too should like to congratulate mr van velzen on an excellent report
i totally support his emphasis on the need to protect the european consumer
we also need more transparency especially in roaming and international tariffs
auctions are a fast transparent fair and economically efficient way of allocating the scarce resources of radio spectrum
governments should not be trying to judge who will be innovative and successful
it has been suggested that auctions are simply a device to provide extra money for governments
that is wrong
the fact that they raise money is subordinate to other aims such as fairness and economic efficiency
it has also been claimed that licence costs will just be passed on to the consumer
i do not believe so
auctions allow the market to determine the commercial value of scarce radio spectrum
more importantly they give greater opportunities to new market entrants
beauty contests often favour incumbents with established track records
auctions are fairer than picking winners which can be more subjective and less transparent
to conclude what we are trying to do is to ensure that the eu maintains its position as the world leader in mobile telephony
the only way to maintain the eu s global lead in this sector is by maintaining a balance between regulation and innovation and not ruling any option out
i believe this report will help us reach this goal
mr president i feel that this report marks a decisive moment for the future of electronic communications in europe
i would stress in particular the fact that the legislation which we are going to vote on and adopt tomorrow will of necessity prove to be a regulation which will become obsolete within a very short space of time
with this in mind and commending this approach i would like to state that i am in favour of the report which has been presented
parliament has reservations about licence auctions for third generation wireless communications
i am also worried for my own part about how licence fees will affect the development of markets
as spectrum distribution will be the responsibility of member states however we in parliament have to accept that competition strategies in the different countries will vary
only time will show what the most rational solution will be
the danger of too much regulation must also be taken into account in good time
i would like to ask the commissioner how the commission intends to promote this coregulation approach
how will it be possible for parliament to exert sufficient influence
i would still like to stress that competition should be promoted openly and transparently to a degree that is adequate and not through price policy regulation
finally i feel that it is important for parliament to express its disapproval of the auction system
i believe that the citizens expect this of us and that the treaty of amsterdam allows us to shorten and speed up these processes
many important things have been said
the commission can agree with most of the report and welcomes the conclusions and recommendations
the commission shares the goals of the report to regulate with a view to achieving a competitive market in this sector
we also share an understanding of how sectorspecific rules can contribute to this objective
this includes a symmetric regulation related to market power and other procompetitive regulations such as number portability
second the regulation needed in respect of general public policy objectives like consumer protection and universal service
looking in the same direction is an important step in ensuring that everyone reaches the desired destination
with regard to the fast adoption of directives the commission totally agrees
as to limiting the life span of the directive to  this raises some questions
the risk is that it would weaken the credibility of legislation and in particular the independence of the regulators
however of course we are ready to discuss any comments made in the report
the commission accepts that there is a certain tension between legal certainty and flexibility
this sends the right signals to markets
otherwise major players will have an incentive to simply delay until the time period expires
on licensing parliament calls for onestop shopping in respect of authorisations in this sector
the commission s proposals would both harmonise and simplify the process that companies go through in order to provide communications services
if the current widely diverse system were retained then the onestop shop model would be logical as the report says
if the harmonised registration system is the solution it could be as simple as the onestop shop model
we must consider the alternatives at the end of the process
mr van velzen has sent me a written question on the auctions
i will use the normal internal procedures to reply to that question but perhaps i can make some comment at this time
i will return to this issue in the formal way
the same question was put by mrs matikainenkallstrom
it is making an ongoing assessment of the economic impact of procedures used
i will return to this issue in detail when i reply to the written question of mr van velzen
mrs matikainenkallstrom put forward the question about local laws and also put the question about the local loop
how can we guarantee that the liberalisation of the last mile will take place
i find it a very important issue
added to that my colleague the competition commissioner will monitor the issue from the viewpoint of potential abuse of a dominant position
thirdly we have decided to put that issue too into the legal proposal for the future legal framework
the first question is could this part be separated out to get it through more quickly
but i agree with your concern that the question of the local loop is the biggest issue this year
mr glante asked the question of who decides what
this is a big issue which we have discussed in many contexts
some people say we should have a european regulator to guarantee full european coherence on those issues
on the other hand there are people who say that it should all go to the member states national authorities and national regulators
we shall come back to that issue in our final proposal
i want once more to express my thanks for the report and for the very interesting debate today
the commission will look forward to working together with the european parliament in the course of the forthcoming legislative process
i share mrs palacio s wish that on this issue the european parliament and the council will be able to take decisions very speedily
eu strategy on financial information
the next item is the commission communication on european union strategy on financial information
mr president the commission approved a communication a moment ago which forms an essential part of the financial services action plan
the capital markets within the european union display a lack of comparability with regard to the annual accounts published by listed companies
in its communication the commission proposes to completely overhaul this situation
this is a major change which directly impacts on approximately seven thousand companies
these international accounting standards are being developed by an organisation from the private sector namely the international accounting standards committee
the european union has no control whatsoever over this organisation even though various europeans are actively involved in the work of the iasc
this mechanism must be proactive in providing input to the iasc in order to establish new standards
this eu approval mechanism will comprise a political and technical aspect
the technical aspect will consist of representatives of the key groups which are closely involved in the problems of financial accounting
the political aspect will encompass all member states
how it will take shape exactly is still to be decided on
more specifically thought will be given to how the european parliament can be involved in the decisionmaking process
it is of course crucially important that the standards also be applied correctly in practice
this requires close cooperation between the member states and between the authorities responsible for supervision on the capital market
the pressure exerted by the markets and member states to make the necessary changes to the legislative framework as soon as possible is considerable
seven thousand companies are required to do this before the year  and this will be quite something
to say at this early stage that these ias should also apply to unlisted companies would be too much of a good thing or des guten zu viel as they say in german
i hesitate to answer this question in the affirmative
it is thus up to that committee from the private sector to lay down these standards
everyone should then adhere to them
if the latter were not the case it would of course make little sense to come up with international standards at all
thank you commissioner
that concludes the debate
the sitting was suspended until voting time at  pm
mr president on a point of order
i should be grateful if the ashtrays could be removed again from outside the chamber
the president asked for them to be removed and they were removed
people stopped smoking out there and they have now been returned
i understand that somebody has ordered their return against the president s wishes
as i keep on having asthma attacks i hope they will be removed again
we will certainly try to have that put right mrs lynne
vote
parliament approved the commission proposal
procedure without debate rule 
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament adopted the decision
parliament adopted the decision
parliament adopted the joint text
bolkestein commission
the commission can accept in full amendments nos   and 
the commission can accept in part amendments nos    and 
the commission cannot accept the remaining amendments
the president declared the common position approved as amended
mr president one partsession follows another and as far as i am concerned they are all starting to look alike
last time i declared an interest in the radio and television broadcasting sector
i must now repeat this statement with regard to this report
i shall not therefore take part in any votes on the matter
the report which was later referred to on bbc news contained a number of inaccuracies
it must be said that is not really appropriate in the middle of voting time
mr president just for the benefit of members regarding the last statement made by mr mcmillanscott
colleagues let us try to address ourselves to the business in hand
parliament adopted the resolution
mr president due to a financial interest i cannot participate in the next vote
on amendment no 
i am afraid we cannot have a split vote
it is out of time
could mr van velzen perhaps comment on whether amendment no  now says considers it important to deepen or to clarify the following concepts 
that is the starting point and it should be mentioned here
so this means that i have to point out that the text should read to clarify
parliament adopted the resolution president
that concludes the vote
in my opinion there should be a common regulation which applies irrespectively of the state of origin of the various members
therefore the entire institution of the immunity of members of the european parliament must be reformed
report zimeray a
mr president i voted against the application to withdraw parliamentary immunity
in my opinion mr zimeray should continue to enjoy parliamentary immunity
our fellow member committed a road traffic offence which is a culpable offence but not a crime
in italy this type of offence does not merit withdrawal of parliamentary immunity
report hulthen a
i therefore feel that it is right for the european parliament to intervene in this matter
 i warmly welcome my colleague anneli hulthen s recommendation for tighter controls on substances depleting the ozone layer
there will be a measure to prevent the hole in the ozone from becoming any larger
britain s labour government has been leading the fight to protect our citizens and to clean up our planet
at kyoto deputy prime minister john prescott managed to secure an agreement to cut global emissions
this target has now been raised to  by 
strong coherent action is urgently required at local national and european levels to clean up our air land and sea
our citizens want to see concrete action not just hot air from politicians
this is our chance to continue our battle for a safer cleaner world
report mckenna a
mr president when i was  years old i used to travel in cruise ships which went from new york to the bahamas and back
twice as much harm was done on that occasion by dumping waste in the sea it affected both the sea and yours truly
i therefore support this report which will prevent the dumping of waste in the sea

by rights this tragedy should have had the effect of seriously reorienting community procedure
this was unfortunately not the case and the procedure stands
it is limited to proposing the exchange of information which is no doubt highly useful for the period 
on the key issues we are still waiting
in a sixmonth period the international oil pollution compensation fund iopcf has not paid out  million in compensation
indeed the iopcf apparatus looks particularly perverse
it is a compensation system with no liability which sets a ceiling unrelated to the extent of actual damages suffered
it is not fair that the state and local authorities should be required to a great extent to take the place of the polluter in meeting expenses
this time the necessary debates and the necessary action must not be postponed
the victims of the erika disaster want their ordeal to serve to prevent the recurrence of this sort of disaster in future
fortunately this house adopted the amendment confirming the principle of polluter pays 
this is a small step in the right direction
report thors a
 major changes to european culture that will happen as a result of digital technology are welcome
however continued good public service broadcasting is essential
guaranteed access to public service and public interest content will be a vital guarantor of universality
it will also be a key driver of digital takeup extending its appeal
due prominence rules will ensure that public service content and channels can be easily found on proprietary electronic programme guides
digital tv is the only convergent technology without basic interoperability
this will promote interoperability without undermining innovation
third parties will need access to this information at the same time as the gateway owners own services
it is important to get the right balance between the eu and member state levels
it is right that the regulatory framework for infrastructure should be established at eu level and implemented nationally
where this occurs the member state should be free to set its own priorities
report van velzen a
beauty contests are in many respects more consumeroriented and more of an alternative that supports the freeing up of the market
on all the other points mr van velzen has our full support
i have read it with great care and it appears to be written in genuine brussels spout for the officialese is extremely difficult to understand
even mobile phones and progress can serve to take away some of the loneliness from the lives of elderly people
i hope that this will happen

it is high time however that we put this fine european idea into practice
in pursuing the interests of untrammelled competition the european parliament does itself no credit
that concludes the explanations of vote
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
mr president i raised this point of order last month and i now have to raise it again
each of the questions is dated presumably with the date when they were submitted yet they are completely out of order
the first was submitted on  may the second on  may the third on  may the fourth on  may and the fifth on  may
is there any rule regulating how they are put in order or some secret method of getting your question to the top of the list
mr purvis the president of this parliament and by delegation her office are responsible for the order of questions
it falls within the competence of the presidency of parliament
first part
question no  by h
does the commission have any strategy for this sensitive region
in future our support will be specifically targeted on these structural objectives
the work of the community complements that of the un the osce and the council of europe
now these refugees have been joined by more refugees from the crisis in chechnya
have you the commission done anything
as i am sure you understand this problem is seriously hampering the political situation in georgia
i very much agree that the refugee issue is a burning problem
we are one of the main contributors to the work concerning refugees in the whole region
also the international organization for migration is involved with our support
people are greatly concerned at what they hear about the present situation in georgia
democratic rights employment rights religious rights are all under very severe pressure
is there nothing more that he and this union can do to help this new state
basically i will have to repeat what i have just said
humanitarian activity is in many ways easier for us to organise and this covers the first part of the problem
question no  by h
does the commission consider that cuba can maintain its observer status under the new agreement
would the commission have been in favour of cuba s signing up to the convention
the european union s future relations with cuba will continue to be guided as in the past by the common position
it is often said that in politics what is not possible is false
could cuba obtain in this new agreement the observer status which it has had during the negotiations
i certainly did not try to reply in a diplomatic fashion but in a clear fashion
i can relate to the question concerning the money and the kind of activity we foresee taking place in cuba
however this year we are taking care to create some bridging financing in order to facilitate a gradual shift from one activity to another
it is not our decision and we have not been involved in any decisionmaking concerning what cuba wants to do
this decision has been entirely their own
i can confirm that the commission is in the process of preparing to implement this analysis
the results of the analysis should be available round about the middle of 
i am also very grateful for your reply myself
does it intend to implement any urgent measure
the analysis is expected to be fully completed in a year from now
it is not clear from the outset that the new euacp agreement will have an adverse impact
we will follow this very closely
so in a sense the relationship and regional relations between neighbours will be able to work both ways
we want to have a thorough analysis of the situation before we come up with specific proposals
question no  by h
this issue has already been included in the social dialogue and we are awaiting the common position of the social partners on  june
i want to thank the commissioner for her answer
restructuring must not be prevented
how very precisely are you going to make use of these in the dialogue with employers and employees
i think that we will be able to use some of the more important aspects of the gyllenhammer report within the framework of the social agenda
question no  by h
second part
questions to mr busquin
each of these plans has been drafted by nongovernmental organisations and cover all the member states
i wish to thank the commissioner for her response
maybe we could be innovative
commissioner you have us as your partners to drive that forward
i agree
i certainly accept that there is a place for social policy in these more extreme situations
however there is a risk of taking it too far
clearly the european commission has stated its position on the need for a balance between competition and social cohesion
and that is what we are constantly trying to achieve maintaining social cohesion with no loss of competitiveness
question no  by h
this was a welcome step
however only one further item of correspondence has been received
on a related subject provision has been made for a mid term review of the fifth framework programme
however if this review is not undertaken by the end of  it will lose much of its value
could the commission reaffirm its commitment to provide information on the implementation of the fifth framework programme
does the commission believe it is still worthwhile completing outstanding projects from the third and fourth framework programmes
could the commission say when it is likely to produce a midterm review of the fifth framework programme
questions to mr liikanen
the commission confirms that pursuant to contractual arrangements all outstanding projects from the third and fourth framework programmes must be completed properly
has the commission given thought to a policy of cancelling all commitments after two or three years if they have not paid
does the commission believe that these policies could be applied to the research budget
finally how does the commission propose to improve the implementation of the research budget in the forthcoming sixth framework programme
that being said even if the amounts in question are minimal they are still covered under contractual liability
furthermore procedures have been revised since the fourth framework programme
indeed as far as the sixth framework programme is concerned we shall be having a discussion about the matter of procedures
the fifth framework programme has i believe already solved the problem of procedure on the point you raise
question no  by h
first of all the background for problems in the export fund is budgetary
we have had the decisions for agenda  since berlin 
these specific measures are designed to replace the acrosstheboard cuts currently in place
the council asked the commission to take into consideration the observations made by member states during the debate on this approach
these observations also covered the question of spirits
as far as spirits are concerned no withdrawal from the list of goods eligible for refunds is foreseen
the intention is to continue to promote the consumption of eu cereals as laid down in protocol  to the uk accession act
in the course of this discussion the commission will supply detailed information justifying its approach
as far as informing the industry is concerned details of the new calculations have already been forwarded to them
unfortunately i do not yet have a report from the meeting
i am grateful to commissioner liikanen for a characteristically thorough answer to each of the points which i raised in my question
i am grateful for the assurances about communication with the industry as well as with governments
that is very important
these parts are suffering very heavily for a variety of reasons agriculturally and in other ways at the moment
i ask him to direct his attention to that
we are very well aware that whisky is a very important product in some areas of scotland
i will pay attention to the issues which were raised by the honourable member
question no  by h
gasfuelled cars emit lower levels of most hydrocarbons but more methane
however gas vehicles emit high levels of methane
emissions of methane cannot be ignored in the context of the eu s climate change policy
derogations are not provided for in the european system for type approval
i should like to thank the commission for its answer
at the same time there are developments under way involving vehicles and also filling stations
 thank you for the question
i will be happy to inform the honourable member of the outcome at a later date
question no  by h
it is tremendously important that vigorous efforts be made to take europe into the information society
will the commission propose that financial resources be released for implementation of the eeurope initiative
mr president first i want to express my gratitude for this question
i wrote a letter with mr barnier to all regions of europe on that issue
so if the infrastructure is there the importance of distance will be less
outside this issue it is very much a question of the member states
there the question is how to make this essential issue a priority for the member states
i would thank the commissioner for his answer
there is also of course the risk of rifts of this kind opening up within the european union
i really do believe that this is a major priority for us now and time flies
i believe now would be an opportune moment for the commission to put forward proposals

i have had the feeling that they already have very many ideas on how to spend the money
the issue of auctions will be carefully monitored
i am sure we will come back to this issue later
question no  by h
i want to thank mr titley for a question which is high on the preparatory agenda in the commission at the moment
however we have not so far been able to make as much progress in implementing this strategy as we had hoped
i thank the commissioner for his reply
in the last commission this was a priority it was an agenda being driven forward by commissioner bangemann supported by commissioner van den broek
will the commissioner reassure me that he intends to take the initiative in this area and not run away from it
we are analysing what points of the action plan it is most important to tackle soon
i hope that come the autumn we will be ready to report on what particular actions we are going to take
secondly the political atmosphere in europe is such that they do not actually create contradictory positions between the member states
since the time allocated to questions to commissioner liikanen has elapsed questions nos   and  will be replied to in writing
questions to mrs reding
question no  by h
subject legal basis for sport the european union does not have competence in the sphere of sport because it is not included in the treaty
can the commission supply information about the negotiations for the inclusion of an article or a protocol in the treaty
these are the parties with legal competence to do so pursuant to article  of the treaty on european union
there is a lack of agreement between member states even among sports ministers
finally the commission has taken note of the declarations by sports organisations requesting some reference to sport in the treaty
there is a lack of agreement
lacking a legal basis it is clearly not possible to assign a specific budget line for sport
on the other hand the commission is aware of the role played by sports organisations on the european social scene
this is why many community programmes are open for such organisations to take part
what is more next year sport will be a priority objective in the youth programme
it serves to bring people together because of the enjoyment it gives of course but also because of its educational role in relation to our young people
commissioner you give a very full response
i would have liked such a response to the written question which i sent to you
your answer simply referred me to the commission s opinion on the igc
i can read documents
i wanted your personal view on mrs zabell s question about legal issues
we have a tradition with the treaty of amsterdam of using protocols to protect specific characteristics
we could perhaps look at the potential of a protocol to protect the specific characteristic of sport in europe
there are many areas now where we have legal challenges as you rightly know in the sport domain particularly in the commercial sector
i should like firstly to apologise to the honourable member if she finds that the written answer was not full enough
i shall ensure that answers to written questions are more complete in future
let me give you a concrete example
this then is a problem which as you can see we are tackling unremittingly
if you wish to achieve something then you must lobby your own governments
as the author is not present question no  lapses
as they deal with the same subject questions nos  and  will be taken together
question no  by h
subject connect initiative the connect initiative was launched in  at the european parliament s instigation
ninetyone of the  projects submitted have been cofinanced by the commission
what is the commission s assessment of the initiative s first year of operation
if not how can the discontinuation of the initiative with effect from  be justified
question no  by h
subject future of the connect initiative education culture and new technologies the connect initiative was launched in  at the european parliament s instigation
since then  of the  projects submitted have been cofinanced by the commission
the latter has also created a connect page on the internet which is proving very useful and which gives the projects a high profile
how does the commission intend to perform such monitoring in order to ensure that the excellent results achieved so far are maintained and improved
it is obvious that an assessment can only be made once some progress has been made in the projects
so please allow me a little time until autumn before making an initial assessment of the progress made in the projects
so let us give it some time and let the projects develop
at the opportune moment during autumn we shall then consider the best plan of action in view of the experience gained
furthermore the implementation of joint actions in  will demonstrate promoters interest in submitting projects
let me tell the honourable member that i have absolutely no intention of getting rid of the essence of connect
i feel the content of connect is extremely important whatever it is called
as you can see it all hangs together
in future if we wish to make progress we must add the development of new technologies to our list of priorities
commissioner i would like to offer a brief reminder
connect saw the light of day with the  budget as a preparatory action covering  to  in fact it was my baby
i would be grateful if you could tell me how this situation can be reconciled with the reply that you have given
mr president the commission launched the connect initiative in  and since then  of the  projects submitted have been cofinanced
the commission intends to make the most of the results and to disseminate them within the member states
we have already taken part in several european meetings organised by the coordinators to provide better guidelines for the projects
the fact is it is all well and good to draw up the initial plan for a project but once it is underway it often becomes clear that it must be redirected
at that point we redirect it if necessary follow it up and assist in disseminating the contents of the project
you may rest assured that parliament will be consulted in deciding the nature of this followup
this would be somewhat unrealistic especially since  as i said  the essence of the connect initiative is i feel most important
question no  by h
does it propose to carry out a detailed study of the radiobroadcasting sector in europe and if so when
a public hearing on radio was held on  may 
does it propose to carry out a detailed study of the radiobroadcasting sector in europe and if so when
does it consider it expedient to create an appropriate statutory framework and how does digital technology fit into the picture
we all know how popular local radio stations are in our member states and so it is important to consolidate radio
commissioner your answer was most helpful
whether or not media plus also covers commercial risks is indeed an issue
of course its justification is that it is supporting television so that it can introduce the new digital technology
the question is why have you not found a way to support radio
i tabled a question on a previous occasion to which you replied that radio probably has no problem
however at the public hearing which we held all the interested parties stated that there is a problem
so there is a problem here
consequently the question remains
i should like to inform the honourable member that media plus has no industrial aspect whatsoever
it is aid for the distribution of european films beyond national frontiers
many details in connection with this have not yet been clarified for example the reallocation of radio frequencies
would it be possible to reduce prices
member states have not yet agreed what course to adopt whether it be one involving terrestrial or satellite systems
as you can see there are still a great many problems to be solved at member state level
otherwise media plus focuses on the promotion and distribution of european films particularly in cinemas
in this way even then the television aspect is not greatly affected
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the commission
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
historical liabilities from jrc nuclear activities
in particular i will mention six points in relation to which our parliamentary work has made particularly significant contributions
of course the expenditure incurred cannot in any way jeopardise the funds destined for research within the successive framework programmes
fifthly parliament will monitor the programme in detail by means of receiving an exhaustive and accurate annual report
finally this financing method is also at odds with the principle of transparency
indeed it is not made clear how much money is reserved for decommissioning activities
the committee on budgets has rejected this working method
as already indicated it proposed to convene a trialogue and to include the solution which emerges from this exercise in the budget procedure for 
i hope that parliament can support this proposal made by the committee on budgets
not only are there no budget provisions but the regulations in force mean that financing arrangements are particularly uncertain
this is why we consider it so important that parliament should be kept fully informed in order to have all the facts at its disposal when debating the matter
the time has now come however to decommission the installations in this sector
clearly then this treaty and the role assigned to the eaec have now also proved to be truly obsolete
madam president i would like to thank my colleague mr vidalquadras roca for drafting an excellent report
for example in addition to normal production many modern plants can utilise the plutonium that would have been used for nuclear weapons prior to decommissioning
serious research into renewable energy sources is possible when we have another form of cheap energy at our disposal
assurance of nuclear safety is one of the most important preconditions of the union s enlargement eastwards
this however must be done in a controlled way
nobody wants to drive the countries of eastern europe into a situation where they are completely dependent on imported energy
we must invest more in the disposal of radioactive waste
for example several years of effort have been made in finland to solve the problem of disposal
a sustainable model for a solution already exists
i hope that the political will to grapple with this issue as swiftly as possible will be found elsewhere in europe
it was an exemplary way of setting about proceeding on what is a very difficult issue
of course with hindsight this is something which should have been considered long ago
the methodology however is quite inadequate and can only be very temporary
we have this historical liability but colleagues this is not something that can possibly be funded from current research
this is not current research
these installations are the property and liability of the whole of the european community not uniquely of the research programmes
conclusion  spells that out most clearly and i fully support it
the traditional budgetary procedure is inadequate and inappropriate for the reasons that have been stated by colleagues
not least it is far too uncertain for a very important task like this
the trialogue is urgently needed
i support amendment no  which says that the present situation the present conclusion is adequate for this year only
that means that we must have a trialogue meeting called within days after the passing of mr vidalquadras roca s report
this work must be done in the safest possible conditions
we cannot have any corners cut in an area where it would actually be dangerous to do so
it must be done properly and properly financed no cutting down on the amount of cooling time
certainly not
we face a timebomb in the joint research centre the imminent loss of very many skilled people who have the knowledge from their time at the joint research centre
those people are getting older and will retire
of course we must look at the historical liabilities but i urge colleagues to support mr vidalquadras roca s report
these installations therefore should not be considered research installations in the sense that is understood today
it should not therefore be the case that the fifth framework programme should singlehandedly carry the cost of decommissioning
it begs the question how seriously we take ourselves if every year we need to look for any leftover funding in order to clean up the nuclear legacy
we should already make provision for the future decommissioning of plants which are still in operation at the moment
this can lead to complications during decommissioning activities and can also result in additional financial problems
i have also suggested including this in the euratom treaty at the forthcoming igc negotiations in nice
madam president the issue of the decommissioning of nuclear waste is a very serious one
nevertheless we can agree on the necessity of dealing with decommissioning and the safe handling of nuclear waste as an urgent requirement
it is not subject to the democratic control of the european parliament because it is not part of the treaties of the european union
we can only accept it for the year  pending a more correct budgetary solution in 
on nuclear waste it is important to emphasise that no solution has been found
only certain member states create nuclear waste and these are the states that should therefore pay for dealing with it

there are obsolete nuclear power plants all over the eu not just the ones that we are considering with the jrc
this has important implications for the future so that we can deal soundly with the situation
there is a growing unease even with the safest and most modern facilities about our increasing dependence on nuclear energy
already we have examples of new installations not being commissioned and a reexamination of policy by some member states
we are living in a time of increasing awareness of the environment and public health
on these issues the public are seeking assurances beyond reasonable doubt
the decision last week to close chernobyl is belatedly welcome
the impact of sellafield on public health and the environment is now a matter of fact
now that these plants have reached the end of their working life we are left with the legacy of decommissioning these plants
a problem in this respect is the fact that the total decommissioning process takes up several decades
it will therefore be some time before we have learned from practical experience how to decommission old nuclear plants
in addition there is no solution in sight as to how to solve the problem of radioactive waste
it will be evident that this state of affairs also has a bearing on finances
this raises the suspicion that decommissioning is seen as unimportant
in my opinion this is a gross underestimation of the cost of decommissioning
it also implies that the price charged for electricity generated by nuclear energy is too low
