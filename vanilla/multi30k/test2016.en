we must bear in mind that times change and the standards change with them
it sounds rather like the tomlinson procedure which was adopted for financing parliament s building in brussels
that was by transferring unexpended funds in odds and ends of budget lines on a yearbyyear basis
so perhaps colleagues should be cautious before we criticise this proposal
i support the proposal for a trialogue
it seems the sensible approach
the work must be done and has to be paid for somehow
this is why in the first place we are not in favour of dealing with the problem of cost as a side issue
using appropriations that have not been used may prove an incentive not to use all research appropriations in order to be able to invest them in decommissioning
decommissioning operations are not compatible with the principle of annual budget payments and all the countries have appropriate internal procedures
madam president this week mr vidalquadras roca has reaped the benefits of the dialogue as have we
i hope that he will promote this dialogue at every given opportunity
in any event i would like to thank him for his report
this legacy however cannot be refused
we are lumbered with it and will have to deal with it in some way or another
we are lumbered with this legacy and it is not fair really to saddle future generations with problems
i would however like to make one comment regarding the report
from this point of view i also beg to differ with mr chichester
i think that a genuine solution has not been found or cannot be found
as far as the euratom treaty is concerned i would go along with what you are saying mr desama but i would press for a critical overhaul of the euratom treaty maybe on the commissioner s initiative
i would therefore also ask whether the niras belgian institute for radioactive waste and fissionable materials report on cost development could be published for example
these territories contain many nuclear power stations which will have to be closed or decommissioned in forthcoming years
the issue of the safe disposal of the waste is to say the least worrying
i tabled two questions on the ispra issue but i did not receive satisfactory responses
madam president ladies and gentlemen first of all i should like to thank parliament and in particular its vicepresident mr vidalquadras for this highquality report
i should also like to pay tribute to the sense of responsibility displayed by the members of parliament today in relation to a complex problem
a number of points raised in this report have already been answered
i can only suggest that you familiarise yourselves with these documents and i shall remain available to discuss the matter
i consider transparency to be absolutely crucial and i share your feeling on this
the documents are available and we are available to discuss them
it must be stressed that they are currently being kept in a secure state with a view to decommissioning in future
indeed this sum applied only to installations already shut down
implementation of this action programme has already started
i now come to the most sensitive and problematic aspect of the matter financing
so this initial solution was adopted as a pragmatic option
indeed i share mr desama s opinion in requesting that this trialogue should be convened as quickly as possible
this is what we want and i think what parliament wants too
we have every reason to adopt a pragmatic and responsible approach
this may lead us to investigate an approach which bypasses the constraints of annual budgetary payments as you pointed out
finally i noted a number of requests from members of parliament particularly the legitimate request for greater transparency
finally we are left with the legitimate question of what is to become of the installations that are still operating
mrs plooij vangorsel spoke of this
the commission does not wish to dodge the issue as it specified in its communication
the commission also mentioned that the solutions adopted by member states are not easy to apply at community level
whatever the case i must thank parliament for its interest and for its responsible proposals
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
restrictions for products subject to excise duties sweden
i also welcome commissioner bolkestein s dynamic approach in this respect
this development results in great economic expansion and has led to more prosperity in europe
also the free movement of goods within the union has become something which both citizens and industry take for granted
there is therefore no doubt in my mind as to the general benefits of the internal market
this is clearly an issue which also has major public health implications
last year all member states agreed to back the second european alcohol action plan drafted by the who
it means that by the year  all european countries must have drafted a tax policy which contributes to a reduction in alcoholrelated accidents
i understand that the swedish presidency will be organising a conference on this subject in stockholm in early 
it is therefore difficult to overlook the significance of the fiscal aspect in this connection
in the united kingdom people cross the channel to france on a massive scale to stock up on alcohol
beer is produced in sweden
in principle fiscal measures are a matter governed by national sovereignty
mr president the general benefits to be had from the internal market are beyond dispute
matters being what they are i should nonetheless like to ask the commission the following questions
why not
apparently commissioner bolkestein was opposed to extending this derogation
why have you changed your mind
what expectations do you have of finland and sweden in relation to the harmonisation of indirect taxes by 
i could continue madam president but my speaking time is running out
the policy is founded partly not solely but partly upon high taxes which entail high consumer prices
in the long run it would probably not in fact be possible to isolate sweden from the rest of europe in this area
there is also alarming intelligence about illicit distilling smuggling etc
against that background i see it as indispensable for sweden now gradually to reduce its taxes on alcohol
in these countries these products ought perhaps to be taxed instead
excessive alcohol consumption is a public health problem to which attention also needs to be paid at european level

madam president sweden has a different alcohol policy from the rest of europe
social policy on alcohol springs from a history of serious heavy drinking
for a long time this policy successfully held its own against influence from outside
that is not the case today
the current derogation regarding imports of alcohol and tobacco into sweden was not going to last forever
the new agreement now in the offing between the swedish government and the eu would involve a gradual increase in import quotas
this is a good compromise which would give sweden the opportunity to adapt to the new situation
mr maaten has prepared a good report
on the contrary mr maaten makes it perfectly clear that alcohol must also begin to be dealt with as a public health issue
at present a large proportion of the alcohol consumed in sweden consists of smuggled and illicitly distilled spirits
border trade between sweden and its neighbours is flourishing
lower taxes are required in sweden but higher taxes may also perhaps be required in some other eu countries
sweden cannot conduct an alcohol policy with the aid of border controls and of tax levels higher than those of our neighbours
now is the time to find new solutions
what is required is a sensible alcohol policy marked by social responsibility and increased responsibility on the part of the individual
a greater european input is needed in sweden but perhaps also a greater swedish input in europe
before the referendum on eu membership the swedish government solemnly promised that swedish alcohol policy would be maintained unaltered
in the long term phasing out the rules on imports means phasing out swedish alcohol policy
it is extremely important to clarify the eu s own policy on this question
what ought the court of justice of the european communities to have said
this is recommended as a part of public health strategy
sweden s positive experiences in these areas ought therefore of course to be made use of by the eu
i do not share that view
this is the situation of alcoholic drink consumption in sweden
these figures are over three times as high as the official figures
let us take care then
it is the same problem
madam president i am concerned about the delay which sweden has now negotiated for itself
i think that deadlines are there to be kept to
i think that we should all abide by the same rules in the internal market and i therefore intend to vote accordingly
i am particularly concerned about young people s drinking habits and the easy access to illegal alcohol
swedish alcohol policy is now in pieces
the swedish alcohol monopoly now opens on saturdays and at more locations
in many ways accessibility has also increased due to the larger number of premises serving alcoholic drinks
i am concerned about this inability to get to grips with the real problems
i would say to goran farm that there has been ample time to do something about this situation
the catalogue of initiatives he mentions should have been embarked upon a long long time ago
what is more a lot can be done in the way of providing information and disseminating knowledge
what makes imports of alcohol into more of a trade issue than a public health issue
the temperance movement and many citizens including myself were satisfied with that
on  march of this year mr guterres prime minister of portugal the country currently holding the presidency of the union described the eu s cultural diversity as a form of wealth
he talked of there not being a single general opinion but  different arenas
for a family with three older children this corresponds to  metric tons of alcohol per week
should that be a socalled right
is that a level consistent with moderate consumption
it is about a onenation mentality and of taking the issue of alcohol and drug abuse seriously in terms of an integrated view of society
madam president i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur mr maaten
this arrangement would normally have expired at the end of this month
sweden has requested more time to adapt its alcohol policy
this has also been stressed by mr farm who said that we need time to adapt our policy
well the european commission is prepared to give sweden until the end of the year  at the latest
i believe that the compromise which has been reached is fair and reasonable
but at the same time it provides for a short further period of adjustment
i am also delighted that mr maaten s report supports the commission proposal
but the commission cannot accept the tabled amendments although it very much understands the reasons which have led to their tabling
as such  and i would also address mr sacredeus here  we are dealing here with fundamental principles of the common internal market
the derogation was supposed to lapse at the end of this month and this has always been provided for
but  once again  this exception was certainly not meant to last forever
maybe you will allow me by way of concluding to address a few points which have been raised by members of parliament this evening
so once again it is very understandable that that health policy is pursued in sweden
mr farm and mrs carlsson have already clarified the way in which it should be pursued
this is the first point which i wanted to raise
the second point concerns the harmonisation of excise duty on alcohol products
the commission might wish it had but it has not
so the report will contain recommendations but the commission does not have instruments at its disposal
i would recommend parliament to adopt mr maaten s report without amendments
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
exchange of information with third countries
therefore as a counterbalance to such broad powers of investigation the authorities are obliged to keep the information secret
the problem is that this exchange generally involves a degree of noncompliance with the obligation to secrecy
a final comment
what has happened in this field may be very significant and it may have very beneficial consequences
if we want to simplify the legislation it will also be necessary to reduce the number of regulations and rationalise the initiatives
the simplification and coherence of the legislation may perhaps have required this
we often have that dilemma within member states
that brings me to the second brief point that i wish to make this evening which is about the need for the consolidation of regulatory authorities themselves
that is a process that has been undertaken within the united kingdom
 i thank the rapporteur mr berenguer fuster very much indeed for his report and for the helpful coordination and cooperation
the approach of the committee on economic and monetary affairs has facilitated prompt adoption of the proposal
the proposal is also a response to international recommendations on the exchange of confidential information
it is necessary to improve supervision of financial conglomerates
this is an aspect which was stressed by mr berenguer fuster this evening and also mr evans
i fully agree with both of them that confidentiality of that information is absolutely essential
mr evans has spoken of the consolidation of regulatory authorities
that indeed is what happens in the united kingdom
the financial services authority headed by mr howard davies is indeed a consolidation of regulatory authorities
that example is followed by sweden or perhaps it is the other way around
in other words both in london and in stockholm there is a consolidated regulatory apparatus
within the fsa in london there is a unit working with banking
there is another unit working with insurance undertakings and there is a third unit working with the stock exchange
they are under one roof but under that one roof there are still distinct entities
mr evans implies that they are cooperating  and indeed they are cooperating  but cooperation means more than being under one roof
mr evans would like the commission to exhort other member states to follow the british example or the swedish example
opinions differ very much indeed
we are dealing here with a very sensitive question
they say we cooperate so what is the worry
i am not saying that there is no reason to be worried
a report was recently produced by a committee under the chairmanship of mr brouwer who is the second in command of the bank of the netherlands
it was welcomed by ecofin
it is available on the internet so anybody can take cognisance of it
nor does it deal with stock exchanges
but thinking does not stop
if it did we would be in a very bad position
everybody knows what has happened in other parts of the world in the way of systemic crises
also everybody knows that the alliances between various stock exchanges are the order of the day
so we must give this further attention and see whether the rise of conglomerates leads to the need for further supervision
this thinking has not led to any firm conclusions but it is continuing
if developments are favourable then i look forward to engaging in a dialogue with this parliament on these very matters
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
imports of beer into finland
the next item is the report a by mrs lulling on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs
finland obtained an extension of this derogation until 
finland also mentions problems to do with health public order and loss of income
in the meantime such imports account for some  of finland s beer retail market
the reason for this is simply the vast price difference resulting from the exorbitant taxes on alcohol in finland
the majority in the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not agree with me on this
this represents definite progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until 
there was a great deal of controversy in committee regarding the problem of alcoholism
the real alcoholism and health problems which result can only be combated by information and education
let us put an end to hypocrisy and let us give up on solutions that do not work
make of it what you will
the report we now have to discuss is a giant step forward in the gradual opening up of the finnish markets
this restriction that is being sought is in itself justifiable as long as the restriction is not a permanent one
this is what everything hinges on at the end of the day
the problem is of course much more acute because of our proximity to third countries that is to say russia and estonia
clearly special rules are also required when it comes to customs relations with these third countries
the fact is that in finland too this policy has proved to be successful when it comes to combating the harm caused by alcohol
on the contrary there is a good deal of research to show that it is in fact effective
however this more restrictive policy is naturally more difficult to implement without the protection of import restrictions
however a whole range of new methods will certainly be required
madam president now that finland has joined the european union she must apply the eu regulations regarding competition
these include regulations on the importation of beer
i would approach the problem however from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity
for a very long time in finland there has been a successful social policy in force where the aim has been to restrict alcohol consumption
all the statistics relating to alcohol consumption speak in favour of continuing with this policy
on the other hand i will admit that consumption is not evenly spread
in finland there are groups of alcohol abusers such as the young for example
it is alcohol consumption among these groups that we aim to influence
one reason for keeping stringent restrictions on imports is for example the matter of public order
an essential part of health policy has been high taxation and at the same time wellmaintained border controls
finland s geographical position is very different from all the other eu countries
beyond our frontiers are countries where prices are low
that is why finland needs an independent mechanism regarding what it itself perceives as reasonable import restrictions
finland believes it justifiable to have a twoyear extension to the restriction on imports from nonmember countries
the discrimination between consumers who are citizens of other countries and finnish consumers is clear and selfjustifying
on this point we radicals will support the amendments tabled by mrs lulling
neither are we convinced madam president by the social or health reasons put forward in support of the derogation
madam president finland is prepared to increase imports of beer from the internal market
the derogation has been restricted in terms of time and i thus support the commission s line here
finland s alcohol policy has been a valid one and we see evidence of this that goes unchallenged anywhere in the world
our problem is the enormous difference in taxation
hardly anywhere else does such a huge difference exist as is the case on the eastern border of our country
the reason is obvious if you think about it for a moment
a whole state collapsed over there and at the same time the price of vodka and beer likewise collapsed
that is what happened over there and we will not get carried away in the flood whatever you tell us
the cost of alcohol fell
besides they concoct alcoholic beverages over there by mixing tap water and homemade spirits
that makes for a pretty powerful brew
you can buy that virtually for the price of the bottle alone
what production could be so cheap that you could compete with that
besides who will be bothered by this restriction on imports from the east
it will not bother anyone at least not the eu
it is being said here that taxation cannot reduce the consumption of alcohol
what sort of experience have you had in this regard
because we do have experience of it
the first thing that the poor cut back on if prices rise is alcohol consumption
there is research data on that
then you say that education helps
i happen to come from a region where such education has been provided
what happened
vodka continues to be drunk as before and on top of that there is wine
in other words total consumption is increasing
and we still have an additional problem
we have high taxation which i used to be in favour of
if private citizens are allowed to bring in more foreign beer tax revenue will fall
in other words there is quite a significant doubleedged problem
i regard a gradual switch as being the correct approach and one where consideration is given to our country s levels of taxation
and if it is removed i will just say that our roads to the east will be soaked in vodka if all import restrictions are lifted
that is the issue here
we could have dealt with this issue in a more appropriate way
it is also obvious that this is mainly a fiscal problem
it is as has been said in actual fact a fiscal problem
i have referred in part to points of order
for my part i nonetheless support the commission s proposal whereby the year  would be the time limit where imports of beer were concerned
the committee has introduced an addendum concerning estonia among other countries
we have a similar problem in many border regions and i would refer in this regard to mr paasilinna s intervention
it is a question of not making a hasty decision
i would also refer to the difficult situation where competition between transport operators in the baltic is concerned
the situation is very unequal and there is a risk of its deteriorating further
madam president finland has had a period of transition to adapt regulations for imports of alcohol to eu levels
this is being done by  according to the deadline fixed in respect of the internal market
the european court of justice and the commission accept this order of priorities and i thus hope for understanding on the part of parliament as well
in my opinion the picture created in mrs lulling s report of the situation in finland is a false one
commissioner you can surely ascertain that from what we finns have been saying here in our speeches
therefore as regards the importation of beer the general euro limit has to be observed which is products to the value of eur 
at russian prices as we have heard this means more than  litres of the best european beer
that is double what a citizen of the eu can bring in from another eu country
the border between finland and russia is quite exceptional in the eu
although the commission very much understands the motives behind the tabled amendments it is unable to accept them
a number of these amendments concern the level of the tariffs applied by finland
that report will also take into account the treaty s general objectives such as health policy
before these restrictions were automatically incorporated into the restrictions within the union
this change will not require a change in the proposal
the new date will most likely be  july of this year
this concludes my comments
i would once again like to express my thanks to the rapporteur

he even suggested that i had reduced excise duties
that would be a fine thing if only i could
the president asked the speaker to conclude i have the right to reply and i shall finish soon
as i was saying i mean to make the most of my right to speak
mr farm also criticised me for defending wine producers
i am proud that i did though
it would even be good for the social security department in finland
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
statistics for trade between member states
this combined nomenclature is a tariff and statistics nomenclature which is used for the trade between member states and that with third countries
within the framework of the slim initiative the simplification of intrastat has been set up as a trial project
indeed the simplification must first and foremost benefit small and mediumsized companies
this proposal along with all other measures to simplify the system can only benefit industry
the report was adopted unanimously without amendments within the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
i would accordingly be indebted to the meps if they were to cast a unanimous vote on this tomorrow
we entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments
why are we supporting this so strongly
reading mr beysen s report the history of this proposal is rather depressing
surely it should not be taking this amount of time to work on largely technical areas
mr beysen was talking about the way that parliament has been working internationally on some of these issues
surely we should be setting our own house in order first
madam president i would like thank all the speakers and especially mr beysen for his work
i would like to congratulate them on their work
however you have raised a couple of issues
firstly mr harbour asks how the process can be speeded up
the commission is not concern about the delay
we are prepared to accelerate the process as far as possible and we are interested in reducing the cost to companies to a minimum
nevertheless we must recognise that we have two problems which we must address in a different way
however we hope that excessive time will not be required in order to arrive at these results
lastly mrs berger asks us which additional initiatives we are going to take
you have said correctly that this is a first step for us
we believe that it is essential to go further with this process of simplification
before we start with the order of business there are still a number of points of order
mr gusinsky is a leading russian community leader being chairman of the russian jewish congress and deputy chairman of the world jewish congress
mr gusinsky s media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise mr putin and his government
his independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of russian troops in chechnya
his programme dolls based on britain s spitting image satirises the president something which supposedly causes him great irritation
now we have this arrest and mr putin says he knows nothing about it
this latest event leaves russia teetering on the brink
the european parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe
thank you
as you can hear from the applause the house has taken note of your comment
 nl mr president i would like to bring up another point
these then degenerate into allout bingeing sessions at which point the cameras start to roll
i think mr president that that is unworthy of parliament
what i would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly
i think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour
my request was looked upon critically whereas these kinds of party where we are portrayed as vultures are simply tolerated
madam please be so kind as to file your concern in writing with the quaestors who will then take the necessary steps
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
in my opinion this matter should be discussed in parliament
i have not quite understood the honourable member
are you saying that he did or did not vote
mr president i have been reading the minutes and it does not say here that he would not have voted
we shall clarify the matter
parliament approved the minutes
what you have suggested is most unusual because normally this is decided when the order of business is adopted
i suggest that we keep to the chosen procedure with debate
i now have another statement to make
yesterday mr lannoye moved to 
interruption by mr brok
mr brok we have moved on to another point
now if you would be so kind as to take your seat that would ease the tension somewhat
the president has informed me that the conference of presidents is due to discuss the question of setting up a temporary committee again tomorrow
i am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary
there is another motion but that is not it
you have therefore not answered my question
i believe i have because as far as the procedure is concerned we have two options
we can do that separately and at different times
but the rules of procedure do not require us to proceed in this way
the motion therefore is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option
it makes no material difference at some point the house will have to state its view
i repeat it would be possible but the president suggests that we proceed differently and i suggest likewise to you now
i feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the conference of presidents
mr lannoye that goes without saying
and of course that is not how it works
there may be one or two people in the conference of presidents who believe that it is but they are labouring under a misapprehension
heckling interjection by mr poettering mr poettering says noone believes that and so your problem is solved
mr president i have taken the floor in order to support the request and i am satisfied with your response
at last tomorrow afternoon the conference will give a response to this request which has been signed by so many members
i have taken note of the honourable member s comment
decision on urgent procedure

mr graefe zu baringdorf has the floor for the opinion of the committee on agriculture as the committee responsible
considerable progress has been made towards consensus and a compromise has been reached on numerous points
we met again yesterday but did not finish editing the compromises and proposed compromises
i should like to reiterate my express thanks in this connection to the commission and commissioner fischler who has been most cooperative in this matter
thank you
the chairman of the committee on agriculture has tabled a procedural motion
according to the rules of procedure one member may speak for and one member may speak against the motion
mrs schierhuber has asked to speak
mr president ladies and gentlemen i agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the committee on agriculture
he has outlined the matter quite clearly
i for my part as rapporteur should like expressly to thank the commission for its willingness to negotiate
we reached a consensus on a great many points and the commission too was willing to compromise
as no one wishes to speak against the motion we shall pass to the vote
parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure
president
before we start on the order of business mr brok has the floor for a personal statement
mr president allow me a brief personal comment
i therefore refute what mr seppanen has said
president
mr korakas on a point of order
mr president we shall shortly be debating mrs lalumiere s motion for a resolution on european security and defence
we requested the amendments this morning between  and  and they were not available
this means that when the time comes to vote on these amendments we shall be unable to debate them first
but as we are not due to vote until thursday i think that there is some justification for holding the debate nonetheless
but basically you are right and we shall make an effort to distribute the documents earlier in future
european political parties
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions
b by mr pasqua on behalf of the union for europe of the nations group to the commission on political parties at european level
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to submit seven considerations on this important issue
the group of the european people s party and european democrats deeply regrets this
thirdly we would remind the house of the important preliminary work carried out in the tsatsos report adopted in  and the kuhne report of  april 
it is this which will enable a solution to be found
the possibilities offered by article  must be used if and insofar as the treaty is not supplemented
nonetheless we take the firm view that supplementing the treaty is the best way forward
this will serve the credibility not only of the parties but also of the european union and the european parliament
however we are taking a constructive view
we want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the european union
the current situation is becoming increasingly complicated
it was traditionally believed in the media that it was necessary to go lobbying in brussels to behave like a pressure group
we managed to have the political parties recognised in our countries they are a fundamental pillar of democracy
nevertheless in ten years no progress has been made and we truly find ourselves in an increasingly difficult situation
we have taken an initiative across the various political groups which we presented in february to president prodi
as a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the treaty for more than seven years now
the question is can the commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of article 
that really is what the debate is about in this house today
the institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency
just as my colleagues have said these parties must be brought out into the light of day
they are in any case already active today
they cannot replace the national parties but cooperation among national parties is no longer necessarily enough
the time perhaps has come to specify that only european parties such as these may enjoy public support
but what is european awareness
the european culture is born of respect for our national cultures and national traditions
new elements are integrated but this must not lead to a situation where one category of individuals dominates to the detriment of another
so a la voltaire if you want to talk to me lay down the rules now
european parties let us not kid ourselves
before hearing the speakers for the groups i would like to give the floor to commissioner barnier
this is not just a question of money
but a stronger european parliament depends on strong groups in parliament which have the authority to act
we want a strong commission which drives the european integration process forward
we want a statute for european political parties because our democracy is a civil and partypolitical parliamentary democracy
but we must not underestimate the psychological importance of this debate
at present people and national parties are elected
the proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference
i readily admit that we want european lists and european members of parliament
the proposals have been made it all depends on the european party statute
the report by the court of auditors containing demands on the groups was also touched on
we shall comply with these demands
but it cannot work against the european parties because that would represent a reduction in our european selfawareness
mr president i take good note of commissioner barnier s statement and the commitment which the commission is making
please allow me to express not a criticism but surprise in relation to the unassailable legal basis
we did not manage to have this included in the treaty of amsterdam
the second step is the amendment of the treaties
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i naturally concur with mrs hautala s views on transparency
but what we need is an initiative  albeit hopelessly overdue  from the commission
but there are questions left unanswered concerning the future too
it has not yet been mentioned here commissioner but i would like to raise the question nevertheless
this seems a rhetorical question to me
i hope that the commission can give me a clear answer to it
mr president ladies and gentlemen there are totally opposing views on european political parties within my group
the main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a european public
direct links with people exist not at a paneuropean but at national or regional level
that is where the parties are anchored that is where their members and electorate are
the situation is in fact quite paradoxical
first there are european parties
secondly there is article  which states that european political parties are an important factor for integration
thirdly at the same time we still have no idea what european political parties actually are
now i am convinced that outside this house noone to all intents and purposes can comprehend or understand this
plus the parties tend to take themselves very seriously
i have nothing against european parties
i think that they face the challenge of achieving crossborder coordination of their work during the course of integration
the criticism of the court of auditors was justified
i should like to close by saying that i too am in favour of finding a solution to this muddle
it is also a project of people who are hoping to create the european federal superstate
in a european union which really respects the principle of subsidiarity we do not need a european political party
mr president i am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples
many problems can only be solved jointly
global problems must be solved in the un
the court here in strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights
in brussels we have close economic cooperation between the eu and the eea in connection with a common market
would we obtain better solutions however if decisionmaking were in every conceivable case to be centralised in brussels
would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties
would more people join become active members and take part in debates in connection with elections and decisionmaking
the supranational eu parties will never win the hearts and minds of ordinary people
they will instead be populated by highly paid officials bound to no country in particular  bureaucrats without roots in local political associations
manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people
an artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the eu
mr president this is a question of democracy
democracy is transparency public accessibility rule by the people and participation
the current european political parties do not represent transparency or public accessibility
it is a rhetorical question but who of us knows anything about the european political parties
they have been discovered in the investigations conducted by the court of auditors
i suspect these abuses are now being covered up
the european political parties do not represent democracy
they are parties of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate directly in their activities
for rule by the nation you need a nation
europe is not a nation it is nations
we have no concept of supranational democracy
parties of parties are not democracy
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  noon
security and defence
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions
it is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the balkans must never happen again
this development complements nato which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in europe
all that remains is article 
in the long run this must be credibly sustained by the european union
this will surely help to develop a coherent foreign security and defence policy
the european parliament will advocate bringing the community position the community part to the fore
this is unattainable at present for certain reasons but we should strive towards it
it is still our aim
we can see that the commission has a large stake and that foreign and security policy is being formulated in the european council
defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions
this must be merged including practically so that such absurdities never occur again
we must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets
we spend more on defence than america but with far fewer results
this also applies to transport satellites and such like
this represents a major effort by the member states to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability
rather the basic objective will be to improve the use and rationalisation of the military assets and capabilities of the member states
the views of parliament shall be taken into consideration by the council
the weu has already taken the decision to allow the eu direct access to these structures
the budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced
the common european security and defence policy requires a close intense and transparent relationship between the european union and nato
if necessary other working groups on specific issues may be created
this structure will be responsible for dialogue cooperation and consultation between these countries
russia ukraine and other european countries may also participate in operations led by the european union
at the feira european council the european union will record the interest expressed by canada in participating in this joint european effort
i welcome the report by mrs lalumiere
it is an exceptionally helpful document
the commission has actively contributed to nonmilitary crisis management since long before the cologne and helsinki summits
we need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action
we need to step up our efforts of coordination
instead our focus lies on using existing instruments and financial resources considerably more efficiently
that gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years
i hope that we will have the support of parliament in working through it
we should build on existing competencies
we should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management
saying no to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation
the commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility
let me be clear about the commission s role
the important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two
look at what the commission is doing around the world we are paying for the training of police in antiterrorism tasks in palestine
we are helping to create border services in the balkans
we are spending money on demining in virtually every continent
this is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy
we had the pleven plan
we had de gasperi
we had fouchet
this time we have to make a difference
we in the commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success
their plans are clear
in the opinion of the nonaligned member states only the creation of a system for crisis management has been decided upon
they stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement
they believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace
nonaligned member states do not want the union to become a military alliance or military superpower
these differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account
it is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration
combined troops of the european union should only be used for crisis management
this means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves
despite these restrictions we are able to pass a sound verdict now in my opinion
let me start by making a positive comment
a large part of the resolution is taken up by nonmilitary crisis management and this is very much how it should be in my opinion
the commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and i think he had every reason to
i would like to specify two
one is the eu s say
i would like to make one final point
what is important is that the analysis and security policy are new
this does not necessarily include more resources
mr president there are matters which give rise to fundamental differences of opinion and this is obviously one of them
this majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it
but it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become
i do not see this is a cause for celebration
even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western europe
it marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect when such problems are met with a military response
i think that the council the commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle
war if anything is the most unsuitable and most counterproductive method in this respect
military is what the usa does best
my group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent european security policy on at least three counts
secondly we reject a european military block formation
germany has earmarked dm  million for civil conflict management projects this year
i think it is a fairly typical figure
it represents  and let me say this very slowly   of military spending
i fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control
which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm no
such an approach would lead to failure
its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions
i would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations
first of all i wonder whether the creation of a european identity is backed by sound motives
i would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives
if we only focus on a strong role for europe on the world stage then we have got it all wrong
it is not about power but about taking responsibility
this cannot be done without joining forces with nato as the latter has all the necessary resources available
the required firm political commitment on the part of all member states of paragraph  of the resolution is lacking
these brief comments do not detract from the fact that it is important to include this subject on the igc agenda
we need plain agreements on competencies in this field
and as far as we are concerned these are still mainly within the national state
at this initial stage mr president parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy
what i have just said with regard to parliament mr president is equally valid for the commission
the balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question
furthermore mr president this european union project is not just a matter of a political economic and military union
our project is based or should be based fundamentally on a community of values
we in the european union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place but as citizens of the union
mr president last month we celebrated europe day
central to this was robert schuman s speech of  may 
security is created through cooperation pure and simple as well as through integration and enlargement
schuman began his speech with these words world peace cannot be preserved without constructive efforts to combat impending dangers 
the first is the global dimension and the second is the purely european dimension
seen in a global perspective security is clearly indivisible
we share the same planet and the same fate
no military arsenals and no new nuclear arms race can provide security against the resentment of the poor
we are of course loyal to the decisions taken in helsinki
the headline goals which have been established are important and must be implemented in full without delay and without exception
at the same time we must however oppose those who wish to exaggerate our military capacity and role
such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills
a policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal
the eu did not manage to stop the catastrophe in the balkans in time and we shall forever be accountable to our children for this failure
nato is at present the most important organisation for peace and security in europe
the eu s member states must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy
there are three main questions which must be answered at feira and which i want to submit to the council
what is the distribution of labour between the eu and nato to look like
we must develop complementary and not duplicate structures
how will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the nonaligned states upon expanding security policy
i congratulate mr patten on his activities in this direction which i should like to support and help develop further
one more point the importance of parliament
its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for feira
mr president europe is in the unique position of not having any enemies who threaten it militarily
this might therefore be the time for extensive military disarmament in europe but in reality rearmament is taking place
nor is this new military force of   to   men to be used within the eu s own territories
there is in fact no common defence commitment rather it is a question of operating outside the eu s borders
it is about intervention
some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days
mr president i too would like to express my great appreciation for the work of mrs lalumiere who has produced an extraordinarily sound document which is also carefully thought out
in tandem with the commission and council parliament would like to contribute to a transparent and convincing policy
after all the european union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature
this seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously
mr president we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions
both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component
these are not just pious words they also have an immediate implication for the way in which this policy is supervised
it would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us
i also have to say that the nature of the tasks which we have in mind the petersberg tasks is such that here is the ideal place where they can be dealt with
this means therefore that the council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate
mr president we do not want to disconnect these tasks from cooperation with north america
obviously not
in fact we are very keen for our security to be undivided
we do not want this
we want to cooperate with north america in these matters too but also  and particularly  with sound backing from the council
thank you catherine lalumiere
the war in and about kosovo has made europeans realise three important things
first that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities
so far we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts
if we want to avoid war we need to give ourselves this capability
today s debate is the european parliament s contribution to these efforts on the part of the european union as a whole
the european parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the council
there can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action
the idea of a joint european and national assembly has not been sufficiently developed by a long chalk
will it need to be more than an informal conversation club
will it be given competencies at the expense of national parliaments
but all too often the council puts to one side what has been decided within the european parliament by consensus or not as the case may be
european unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace
this is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions
i am not only thinking of kosovo which has been so important to us as an eyeopener
this peace is communal and it should also be maintained communally
i do not congratulate the rapporteur mrs lalumiere i am disgusted by her proposal
i want to address a word to people in london
it is reported in the newspapers that certain people in london are saying they would end the eu s involvement in the defence process
to london i say you cannot do that be realistic
please face reality
this is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating
we must try to shape it positively
cologne and helsinki have added substance to the common european security and defence policy
with unusual drive the european council has taken a number of important decisions of which we have taken note and for which we have given due credit
the aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the socalled petersberg tasks
a decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect
a draft of the necessary decisionmaking mechanisms is in place
a smallscale nato is emerging
the european union must be able to act autonomously
this may sound obvious but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem
what does autonomous mean in relation to nato
in summary the question which i would like to put to the council is what is autonomy in this context
is action within a nato context always the first option as the americans claim
the second point is about democratic control
in the netherlands there has been a lot of discussion recently about who was involved in what decisions in bosnia and kosovo
this mainly relates to the government
but if some kind of policy of faits accomplis is already mentioned sometimes at this level then what about parliamentary control
here too the pertinent question arises as to whether the council pays any attention to this at all
operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved
mrs lalumiere s resolution contains a relevant proposal for tackling the threat of a democratic deficit in this connection
the government conference can benefit from this
it is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the european union
the last speaker said that a smallscale nato is emerging
many members especially citizens in neutral countries have no say on whether this is what they want
we need to address that
with respect to the neutral countries some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence
finally i was quite amazed to hear mr newton dunn cite the ruc as a good example of policing
i am sure there are good examples but the ruc is not one of them
i should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy
peace and security are not suitable subjects for council meetings in camera
they must be subject to parliamentary control
it is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments
it is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments
this european security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this house
the presidentinoffice has said that transparency and clarity are needed
i am reminded of the policy of the christmas goose trying to postpone christmas
it would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the european parliament is the right forum
i think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this summit
it is a remarkable achievement
i also wish to congratulate the council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals
that as we are already seeing will drive forward the agenda very rapidly
we need a strong competitive european defence industry
notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector there is still far too much fragmentation in this area
we still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity
the western european union armaments group for example moves very slowly on the basis of consensus
i believe the pillar structure of the eu provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate
the commission has a crucial role in this
the last commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries there were two communications
this commission has been completely silent on this issue
it is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the treaties
mr president considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common european security and defence policy
the cologne helsinki and lisbon councils have all made significant contributions in that regard
i think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity
kosovo has been mentioned several times today
in fact four issues are at stake
first prevention of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of kosovo
secondly deterrence of which there was certainly too little in the case of kosovo because no common will was visible
thirdly the facility for rapid targeted intervention
this functioned perhaps to a certain extent although the fight about what constitutes the optimum form of intervention blocked a great deal
and fourthly the restoration and stabilisation of peace including after military intervention
developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think
but we should try for institutional revolution
this is somewhat disingenuous
but this apparently is not enough
the real desire is to create something separate from nato
there should not be attempts to create a european armed police force behind the cloak of the common european security and defence policy
there is a psychological explanation for this
from this point of view the draft which we are debating does not constitute a threat to the cohesion of iaoi
on the contrary a europe with its own military initiative will take its nato obligations more seriously
we cannot build up an expensive parallel structure
after all crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twentyfirst century
i should like to congratulate mrs lalumiere because she has taken a huge step forward in her report
the problem with a european foreign policy is not quantitative
there is no problem with the figures
it is qualitative
because foreign policy nowadays cannot and must not merely be the product of simple intergovernmental cooperation
on the contrary it must be derived by operating a multidimensional structure and system within which the parliamentary aspect plays an important part
mr president ladies and gentlemen a year has gone by since the war in kosovo and intensive reconstruction work has begun
an enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed
to avoid similar disasters in the future we are now taking new steps to establish a common european defence and security policy
i am extremely pleased that this process is going on
within the framework of the eu s mandate this joint commitment is now being carried out and intensified
the eu has a complementary role and that is why mrs lalumiere s report is so commendable
this concept is based upon individual member states fulfilling the commitments they have made
our main role in the european parliament is therefore to exercise supervision
i have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the member states
these defence budgets are shrinking at the same time as we require investment in restructuring and new hardware
this is the case with the establishment of an effective common european security and defence policy
after decades of a bipolar world the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the european union s contribution will be decisive
peace must continue to be the grand plan of european construction but this will not happen by itself
the choices seem clear the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive
reforms must be implemented major financial resources and means must be identified made compatible and mobilised
the commitment of the member states is essential
the current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over
i congratulate mrs lalumiere on her work
this report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in helsinki
in any case it is essential particularly with regard to the national parliaments to guarantee their association with any future development in this area
we too share these concerns
this committee was specifically created during the portuguese presidency
mr president it has been an interesting debate
we have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it as one would anticipate
i shall be mercifully brief
i do not want to come between parliament and its preprandial democratic duty
however there are a couple of points i should like to make
we need our own crisis units in the commission but we should keep that small
i am bound to say that is one of my obsessions
it is one of my obsessions in relation to for instance meda regulation and in relation to the balkans
we brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the balkans
we have made proposals for cleaning up the danube
those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals
i hope we can get quick decisions
so in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities
the sooner we face up to that the better not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy
once again i thank the honourable member for her superb report
i can only imagine the amount of work that went into it
all of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well
president
i have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
welcome
we now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with australia
i wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in strasbourg
vote
mr perry has the floor on a point of order
madam president outside the door of this chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet
is this allowed under our rules
i should like to point out that there is an important typographical error in amendment no  which members will have
it mentions the president of canada this should read the parliament of canada
there is no president of canada
the head of state of canada is her majesty the queen who is also the head of state of australia
calendar of partsessions of parliament for the year 
dell alba tdi
these amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible
we could therefore quite easily have voted in favour of our amendments waited for the results of the igc and adapted the calendar accordingly
i dispute the statement that these amendments supported by many of my fellow members are inadmissible
there is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on
that is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable
on the other hand all the other amendments have been deemed to be acceptable and indeed has always been the case
parliament adopted the calendar of partsessions as amended
simplified procedure  without report
parliament approved the initiative
parliament approved the commission proposal
the president approved the common position
is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against
madam president ladies and gentlemen this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue
i think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time
madam president i must state my opposition to this request to postpone the vote i do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action
i would remind you that the council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard parliament s views
if we postpone our vote the tobacco industry will gain even more time since the council will then not be able to state its position until the end of june
furthermore i think that mr maaten and the commission on the environment public health and consumer policy have produced a good piece of work
as it happens however i do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote
everything is in place for a vote to be held
parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
president
applause
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
report a by mrs lulling on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs
parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes
parliament adopted the resolution
please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency
we have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the treaty
that cannot be the purpose of the compromise
explanations of vote  parliament s calendar of partsessions  
by the same token and out of respect for the rule of law i voted against the amendments which seek to cancel the additional partsessions in brussels
it is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the treaties regarding our working venues although it is not an intention that i share
to whittle away however at the provisions of the treaty and the annexed acts is a method that is not worthy of the parliamentary institution
i decided to vote not to work on fridays because friday was inconvenient for almost all the members
this is because parliament s work is not being organised properly
i take the view that this violates the treaty and violates the agreement on where parliament sits
every employee in the community hundreds of millions of people work a fiveday week
i think it is a disgrace it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous 
the president cut the speaker off
mr president i too should like to endorse the statement made by my fellow member from the liberal group mrs flesch
i would like to add something further
it is a fact that very few members of the house are present here in strasbourg on friday mornings
i urge the bureau to be consistent and to also remove the possibility of meps receiving money for fridays on which they have not worked

it undermines parliament s credibility and political impact
the solution to this problem would be to concentrate parliament s work at only one place
we call upon the member states to consider a change of the treaty allowing the european parliament to decide upon its own seat

i have not missed one day in any of the parliamentary sessions since the election and i believe only two in the previous parliament
it is therefore with some hesitation that i voted for the deletion of fridays from the strasbourg sessions
it does this institution no favours when on a friday there are fewer than a hundred members debating a resolution which is of no importance
this parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions
beysen recommendation a
is it so that we know how many sweets have passed from italy into france or how many tractors have passed from germany into sweden for example
this seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for parliament
but to what end
we must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well
maaten report a
but when in the past have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking
only once mr president
and when was that you may ask
there we are we should have written smoking kills and governments are grateful for their saving in pension expenditure 
all cigarettes are harmful
none do any good
i agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards
no man is an island
all human beings are involved with each other
i disagree with newton dunn it is not a question of double standards
but we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here
other regions must decide on their own regulations
we cannot have rules which damage exports with the result that others will then export to these regions
mr president this is just a brief statement to declare that i do not totally agree with the maaten report either
there are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry which we must protect at all costs
mr president i share this explanation of vote with mrs cauquil and mrs bordes
this dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of community policy
the european union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand
there is an irresolvable contradiction between the promotion of tobacco cultivation on the one hand and the advertising ban on the other
mr president i have voted decidedly in favour of the amended proposal and of the legislative resolution with regard to the new tobacco directive
despite this these texts too are of value because they send out a message they show that parliament puts public health first
protecting public health is effectively our responsibility
public health is not just any old interest it is of general interest
today we have proved that we stand for this and that is how it should be
more than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the eu in 
i welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling
health warnings will take up  of the front of the packet and  of the back
each individual brand should list all additives not just the prohibited ingredients
this must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of trade secrecy 
people have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco
the greens want to ban many of the more than  additives in cigarettes
we need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested
smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains
 el no one denies the harmful effects of smoking and no one can object to measures being taken to reduce smoking
from this point of view the commission s proposal for a directive contains positive provisions
we as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction
 pt the debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between members
as imports are not being prohibited the american multinationals would be the only ones to gain from a reduction in the production and manufacture of tobacco in europe
i also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts
this proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view
unfortunately my proposal was not adopted
 de i was the rapporteur in this house for the common organisation of the raw tobacco market over  years ago
however i am not trying here to come to terms with the past
we have got them used to subsidies and that has to all intents and purposes destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco
what is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the european tobacco industry
one cannot shake off the impression that certain people in the health lobby would prefer to exile smokers altogether
the ban on snuff which applies in all eu countries except for sweden ought therefore to be lifted
the advantage of snuff is that using it does not affect the environment
snuff is addictive
the tobacco industry should not therefore be allowed to market snuff as something healthy

the question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report

fr smoking kills it causes   deaths every year in the european union which is  a day or almost one a minute
one smoker in two will die sooner or later from a smokingrelated disease
these figures speak for themselves and are terrifying
tobacco is not just like any other product
i supported amendment no  on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 
to the antiprohibitionists who feel that this ban would on the contrary make cigarettes more attractive to young people i would answer with an ethical argument
our society has the duty in certain areas to set strict moral limits
it is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here
this also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular
i voted in the strongest possible terms against amendment no 
europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets
during yesterday s debate some members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis aids or other infectious diseases
this factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands
moreover we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to greece

nobody questions the validity of its aims smoking kills   people per year in the european union alone

the new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs with warnings  of the packet size on the front and  on the back
smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that
as many as half a million people in europe are killed by tobacco and  of lung cancers are caused by smoking
i am disappointed it was not accepted
it is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation
i am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals
they have misled people for far too long
at present warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging
smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice
the proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as ultra light and low tar 
people have been hooked on the idea that mild and low tar cigarettes are healthier
this is simply not true
low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes
this legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives
 de i voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons
this sort of ban benefits no one because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the eu
but the jobs will be lost here
the eu has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban
it has nothing to do with the internal single market
the antitobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide
the eu is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world
that is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries
unilateral action by the eu will be pointless
berenguer fuster report a
the members of the pensioners party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent
i feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection
lulling report a
for my part i would like there to be a free market
therefore this trade between one state and another which was caused by different levels of duties was only natural
if we want to avoid it we must remove all the excise duties in the european union
the rapporteur mrs lulling strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in finland in her report which she considers to be unreasonably high
she also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions
in my opinion the commission s proposal is a rather good compromise however
imports of beer from nonmember countries such as russia and estonia would be limited to six litres up to the year 
derogations with regard to community legislation must be allowed if they are made on the basis of higher levels of health protection
the commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the swedish derogations from  concerning private imports of alcohol into sweden while finland is obtaining a new derogation the swedish one is being removed
vidalquadras roca report a
sadly today we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about
and who was that
we should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible although i still do not know who that is
maybe you can enlighten me mr president

it is true that he rejected the proposal by the european commission
to this end it would use a reception line under the current subsection b which covers energy the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment
i must take this opportunity to say that i do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line
that would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem
on the other hand the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a selfcontained budget line
nevertheless we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity
in the long term then we will have to put pressure on the council to accept the creation of this selfcontained budget line
in the shorter term for pragmatic reasons we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
special un conference women 
this assessment was carried out over many sessions with preparatory meetings initially being held within a propcom
one of these parts concerned the measures and policies to be approved by governments in order to consolidate not only the beijing platform but also everything which has been achieved by the various countries in the meantime
there was also for the first time a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity usually associated with the male role and the need for jobsharing
the role of men was adequately emphasised as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies
i want to apologise for the fact that my colleague commissioner diamantopoulou is unable to be here this afternoon
as some of you will know she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate
we should also thank parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session
however beyond that they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the member states and from associated countries
that was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination
the european union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at new york
collectively we fought hard to move forward from beijing
if we succeeded it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions
and succeed i think we can say we certainly did
we managed that without having to concede any watering down of the beijing platform in other areas
the document reaffirms women s rights as human rights
it recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds
the outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity
the document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women
it also has something to say on methodology  how in other words to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice
at the european union s insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators
i hope nobody will doubt the commission s determination to do precisely that
the conference has shown that over the past couple of years we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas
