resumption of the session
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this partsession
please rise then for this minute s silence
the house rose and observed a minute s silence
madam president on a point of order
yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate
if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested
madam president on a point of order
i would like your advice about rule  concerning inadmissibility
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability
at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld
thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly
indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted
madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest
it is the case of alexander nikitin
now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing
yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter
but madam president my personal request has not been met
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well
mrs plooijvan gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday
it will i hope be examined in a positive light
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 
why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings
why are there no fire instructions
why have the staircases not been improved since my accident
why are nosmoking areas not enforced
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves
mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done
i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case
mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this
i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be
today s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there
so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo
as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile
there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future
we do not know what is happening
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people
in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday
agenda
no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday
relating to wednesday
i would like mr baron crespo who made the request to speak to propose it that is if he so wishes of course
then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against
to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of  september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible
according to its president it is in a position to do so
applause from the pse group
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated
parliament rejected the request president
still on the subject of wednesday s sitting i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax
the ppede group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind
that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda
thank you mr poettering
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request
madam president i would firstly like to point out mr poettering s lack of logic
it is not a lot to ask
parliament rejected the request with  votes for  votes against and  abstentions
madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate
thank you very much
madam president has my vote been counted i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card
my vote was in favour 
indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be 
madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote
there is no room for amendments
that did not happen
this is an important matter
you did not call me either
i regret this but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there
i am terribly sorry mr hansch and mr cox i did not see you asking to speak
even so i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes
this seems to me to be a workable solution
of course the minutes for tomorrow s sitting will take into account any additional explanations
i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely timeconsuming explanations of votes
mr cox mr hansch would this be acceptable to you
madam president if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not and cannot object to that
if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote i accept that but with reservations
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes as we always do of course
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted then we may correct them if necessary
the order of business was adopted thus amended
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed
our amendments from the first reading have i believe been taken into account very satisfactorily
i would urge you to endorse this
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit
in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province
all the same we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety
i congratulate him on his excellent report
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved
madam president i would like to make a few comments
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements
this is a pity in a sense
in short the issue is an important one
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially with smaller companies as these cannot afford safety advisors
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems
the work is done all that remains is the business of enforcement
i would like to mention one final point
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period
madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements
this however does not seem feasible
finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support
i should like to make just a few comments
my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards
i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation
my third point has also been mentioned already
as you know like mr rack i come from a transit country where this issue plays a particularly important role
as mr simpson has said very correctly this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves
margarine and a few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to a genuine disaster
therefore we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved
finally i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
transport of dangerous goods by road
delays in the cen s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive
in particular annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job
in this respect i accept this proposal to amend directive ec which has been tabled for discussion today
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 
in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out
mr president colleagues a happy new year and millennium to you all
i would like to briefly comment on the commission s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road
consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr koch s intrinsically excellent report which have been adopted by our committee
my amendments concern the frostresistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods
there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us remember them
i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to oc
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow s vote
i thought that it was quite superb
this directive is a contribution to this
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance
mr president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways and by sea
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind
in area after area we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned
in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to another
by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union
it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also be flexible
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more farreaching regional provisions
a moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of  degrees below zero but of  degrees below zero
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
structural funds  cohesion fund coordination
we have seen poverty growing in wales and growing still further since 
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects
finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent
this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales
mr president our committee views these issues very differently and to start i will speak from the point of view of research
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood
in the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively
the consequences do not inspire hope
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union
agriculture only provides  of employment in the union
furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are parttime and require supplements to their incomes
mr president commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well
small and mediumsized businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds
it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective  additionality
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today
i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hitech sector
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines
we are badly behind now in this matter
for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned
projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they have to be made more productive
while the report was being prepared it was interesting to discuss the union s regional policy in general
for us new members it was the first time and this was a very interesting process
this report is very good and our group supports it
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population
this fact means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically
i do not think however that this report has come too late
our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic
they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for
this latter point is of particular importance
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone
unfortunately this did not happen mr bernie is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee
i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament s position
personally i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines
as an islander however i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development
therefore the commission should address the issue once and for all
mr president commissioner in this minute and a half i should like first of all to congratulate mrs schroedter
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will of course have a considerable impact both in budgetary and geographical terms
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us
finally in this time of natural disasters i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds
as you know it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation
europe should not be completely absent as the states tend to want
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear
mr president the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form
well the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds
the commission however though bound to issue guidelines does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner
the report put forward today reestablishes its place in the political sphere
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development
this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it
mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work
i would like to explain our thinking here
firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds
finally we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation
i urge the house to support these changes
despite the steps taken thus far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment
mr president mrs schroedter s report undoubtedly contains several important observations and i would like to congratulate her on that
however i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community s regional policy
quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities
the union s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy
a large section of the union s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grassroots
unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented
the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union s fundamental objectives
nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities
they are growing but only in terms of gdp
when i speak of optimum utilisation i am referring both to the national and regional levels
and so mr seppanen i shall also mention at this point speaking of the national level the link with the cohesion fund
this is the purpose of these guidelines
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work
so that is the first priority the competitiveness of regional economies
the third objective is urban and rural development within the scope of a balanced territorial policy
in fact the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account the first is rural development and let me say mrs schroedter that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made ladies and gentlemen and firstly on procedure
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date
drawing to a close i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated mrs schroedter
i am thinking for example of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring s negotiations
i actually quoted the text itself in quotation marks
i find the opposite the case
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy
in any event i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms
i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union
the european commission s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one negative
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation
this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period
the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union s regional policy aims
the report shows that growth has been uneven despite all our efforts
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe
we now require an indepth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas
it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union s more remote areas
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced
for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and knowhow
our group is in favour of adopting this report
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demandorientated economic policy is not the answer
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and to a lesser extent in rationalisation
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions
in other words what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there
mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his indepth report
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union
from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect
as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for
also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions
it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit
surely this must be the ultimate goal
following on from this it is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid a great deal of problems later on
finally i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries
genuine structural reforms and a competitionfriendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided i would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries
in this connection french speakers would speak of a coup de chapeau  in other words i take my hat off to the eu
what is the result
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems
we must give them this opportunity
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have
the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will
what is a fair society
mr president commissioner as my time is limited i shall get straight to the point
firstly let me make a statement of fact the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union
the most remote regions still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates offer one example of this
in reunion for example the rate is 
this is not a situation related to the economic climate however rather it is a structural problem created by our remoteness our insularity in short our own specific personality
the principle of specific exceptional treatment was envisaged in article  of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases
it only remains to put this principle into practice
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission
i should also like to make a few comments firstly mr berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report
so much for the quality
regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike
i agree with your analysis
i should like to mention a few specific points
mr berend you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly
well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase
you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 
mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio sanchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector
and finally there are the crossborder aspects i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points
finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate
this is my first point regarding the policy
my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process
i am thinking in particular of the preaccession structural instrument which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
i refer to item  on the order of business
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation
it should not be dramatised into something more than that
thank you very much mr cox
i understand what you are saying
we have taken note of this
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today s agenda
mr wynn that makes sense
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong
i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this is a serious problem
mrs ahern we have taken note of this
we will also pass this on to our services however
thank you very much
the minutes were approved
reform of european competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
mr president commissioner today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union s competition policy
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy
it should continue along this path
only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency
the competition report  is not a bad foundation for this but in fact there is nothing that could not be further improved upon
i do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen strengthening and intensifying it
therefore i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area
i also expect the commission to be proactive in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions
with all due respect for the principle of competition competition is not however an end in itself
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses monopolies law being one example
competition yes restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition
my last comment was intended not so much for the commission as for the members of the group of the european people s party
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund among other things which come at the top of the list
this being the case let me now come to the proposals made in the report
the commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the member states
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting
there is in particular one amendment let me point out concerning the energy sector which in my capacity as rapporteur i see as particularly important
there were a total of  cases in  and the commission submitted its own report on these
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly
hence what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future
under article  the commission is obliged to supervise state aid
furthermore the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on  december 
in addition there is a special provision of up to eur  million for greece
there must be no wateringdown of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code
no one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in europe
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to followup regulations of this kind
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets
mr president ladies and gentlemen the internal market is not complete
subsidies monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time but then it happens again
subsidies distort allocations both within and between countries
a successive phasing out of state aid is required and more and more markets must be opened up to competition
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies both private and public
public monopolies are more often than not phased out reluctantly
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures
effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently
in fact competition policy and consumer policy belong together
the internal market is the basis for our work
its legislation is to apply equally to all to large and small countries alike
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled
the eu s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed
in order to be effective it must be well anchored in the member states national authorities
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by mr von wogau and mr rapkay
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau mr langen mr rapkay and mr jonckheer as well as the commission for their excellent cooperation
all this is to the good of the consumer
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs at any rate
at the same time this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world of course
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a marker for less red tape
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy
however when it comes to what the future holds for competition there are two issues dear to my heart
one is subsidiarity
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union
i would cite by way of example the issue of job creation schemes savings banks and regional banks and gutesiegel
here a region has by its own efforts created a means of marketing its own products
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other
these days someone who lives in an old people s home is accommodated within the social field
thank you very much mr radwan
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market
a slim rightwing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures
even if the majority in this house were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market it would not make any difference to the real world
while since the dawn of time the market has been the key forum for human interchange it has never been perfect
the market favours the short term and immediate profits
in order to function the market needs rules
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose
the market is not an end in itself it must help to improve the human condition
finally aid can enable restructuring offer training save jobs and thus knowhow
the main objective of the union s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union particularly economic and social cohesion sustainable development and research
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid
the internet is not a product of the market but the result of research financed by the american army
the german government s intervention to save the holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy
president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism
i did not hear mr duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund ltcm
human labour on the other hand is considered to be a simple factor in the equation
we socialists reject the liberals naive optimism on this point
we want a true culture of competition in europe
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party has tabled  amendments in the committee all concerning state aid
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition
you have shown us the way mr monti with the single market scoreboard
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid
to conclude i want to welcome the commission s xviiith report on competition policy on which once again a good deal of work has been done
but as i have already mentioned our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness
mr president commissioner there are just two questions which must be answered
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level
we feel this is relatively dangerous but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything
mr president once again we are debating the european union s competition policy
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us
should we not be discussing this issue
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these privatesector monopolies
they have lost their status and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant
when will we debate that
at the same time unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it
the competition policy has as far as these resources permitted contributed to this event
what is being done may well be very important but it is still not sufficient
mr president a white paper by definition is not something you can take or leave
it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views
firstly these relate to the coherence of the policy s application
it is true there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way
secondly i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future
fifthly with the pending enlargement i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game
they are still in training as it were
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into firstclass players in the league of the internal market
is the commission considering taking any action to allow inhouse lawyers in all member states legal privilege
mr president i would like in beginning my speech regarding the white paper to congratulate the rapporteur mr von wogau
we are therefore in agreement with the report commissioner as well as the broad outlines of the white paper
since the treaty entered into force community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy
after almost forty years of being in force these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion for this reason modernisation was essential
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform as was unanimously requested by specialised companies academics and lawyers
i have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system
national competition authorities were able to apply articles  and  for some time
however they could not apply article  which to a certain extent prevented the coherent application of article 
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report
secondly regulation  must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation
for these reasons we are going to vote in favour of the report
frankly i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory
if it functions well if we are satisfied if the commission has basically acted correctly why the need for the modification
various arguments have been presented in its favour
this is why i give this report my full support
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission s proposals
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti
we look to him as the man to root out cartels
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy
i know that the commission is set against this but the potential exists
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court
well we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment
so judicially something needs to be done
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area
in relation to legal certainty i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen
it is important that business has legal certainty
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change
we have been told how currently people s time is being wasted and that the changes therefore could be beneficial
but i really feel that in the circumstances we want to know what the implications would be for business
finally we as british conservatives are looking for a change in direction towards the development of an independent competition authority
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that
mr president the european union s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies
we can be proud of a european competition culture for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision
however we must be vigilant in the face of global operators against whom nationstates are no longer able to impose limits
society is surrendering itself to the economy
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union
in common with the other members i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement
at the same time it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives
a word on the white paper the revision of articles  and  represents a change of direction in monopolies policy
the problem of overwork highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system
indeed it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty
mr president commissioner competition is exactly what we need
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this
but a system cannot function in this way it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union s competition policy is designed to achieve
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the prerequisites of managerial economics
to that end we must also make it our business to take more account of demandorientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper
no other member state is at such a disadvantage
mr president the monopolies ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ban to be unsatisfactory something i would wholeheartedly agree with
but opinion differs as to the solution
in other words we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law
we would be changing the law to make it executable again which is something i consider to be unacceptable
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped in other words the commission will be completely in the dark in future
this is unacceptable to my mind
the commission s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced followup supervision of the national authorities and member states courts
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy
this is unacceptable in my view
it would weaken a key element of european policy
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition
in any case the commission s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties
there was no majority for this at the time
i consider this to be unacceptable
as the court of justice recognised in  the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competitionrelated disturbances
the commission suggests shorter deadlines
i agree with this request
in the interests of equality either the code must be applied or it must be modified
we therefore await and i await the european commission s proposals on this matter
mr president i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen which concerns aid to the steel industry
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues
firstly i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and secondly on the need for transparency with regard to this aid
however the thing that worries us most mr president is the decrease in prices by  owing to imports
i live in a region where the shipbuilding industry now has very serious problems asturias
with global markets we need global employment laws and global subsidies
however it must be europeanised taking into account the principle of subsidiarity
i also welcome therefore the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual without the commission giving up any of its responsibility
i am in suspense as to how the discussions which were broadly based will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal
the commission report confirms that with the exception of germany state aid to businesses is increasing
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition
as far as we are concerned we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business
take for example the car manufacturing sector where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by  during the reference period
with what aim
not to save jobs
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies
did these firms need state aid to survive
no car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions
firstly it is necessary in drawing up the legislation to produce clear and complete rules
fourthly and lastly  and this has already been mentioned  the international legal order has changed
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application
many of the report s conclusions however are cause for concern at least for our group
the form the aid takes is important
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy
mr rapkay s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law
in my opinion it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law
i would like to thank the rapporteur mr von wogau for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts
there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands all of which must be protected
mr president competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition marked by clear uniform rules
in his report karl von wogau manages to capture this very well
but europe is changing
the economies are growing we are enlarging to  member states
the european commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy
this is not in question
having said this i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given
it is not enough to say that in the member states there is already  years worth of experience
in the netherlands the competition authority is still in its infancy
uniformity needs to be worked on
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise
what is the commissioner s opinion of this
i would like to finish off by making an important point for small and mediumsized businesses
through cooperation small independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed
secondly we have the issue of companies legal certainty
it is true commissioner that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty
we all agree on this
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said
there have only been nine rejections
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer
this is therefore an aspect to be considered
thirdly we have the problem of the uniform application of community law
in this respect the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon
here improvements should be made
only in certain countries germany for example is there specialised jurisdiction
perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore but we must also explore others
commissioner it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform
in my opinion mr president this joint debate fully bears this out
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order
the groups are the efficiency of the rules the risk of renationalisation consistent application of the rules and legal certainty i will take these very quickly one at a time
at the end of the day i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission s activities but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation not renationalisation of competition law
in a directly applicable exception system consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework both through general provisions and through its decisionmaking practice
secondly we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns mrs peijs
the purpose of publishing the white paper is after all to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation
many speakers have underlined this
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes
why
is this simply a political gesture
no
most smes have in fact less than  of the market share
the fourth group is legal certainty
fr mrs thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be reexamined the exchange of confidential information
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully
i will mention only two in order to be brief
the first is greater transparency
in april  the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment
in the near future  and i can assure you of this  you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules
i am especially grateful for all of this
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs and at a more general level with parliament
in this regard i liked your term mrs palacio vallelersundi we must all pull together preferably in the same direction
competition is not an end in itself as mr rapkay rightly pointed out but it plays an extremely important role in european integration
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social as well as economic role in the european integration process as it has done in the past
thank you commissioner monti
the joint debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
protection under criminal law of the union s financial interests
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud to detecting it punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed
so far efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures
for it to enter into force it must be ratified by all  member states
after five years only four have done so
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being  september in a proposed amendment
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the socalled five wise men
the commission mr barnier mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea
i call upon you ladies and gentlemen to vote in favour of this report which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority
mr president i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato
this moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of article 
however this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly
mr president this as mrs theato said is a critical report
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an owninitiative report
we need to do something about it
we need to take this responsibility seriously
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union
the question is who prosecutes
that is where we really get into difficulty
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted and that is not the case at the moment
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio
we are aware that it is a delicate debate
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable
mr president i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report
i think it is a firstclass report which will for the most part be supported by my group
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months this could well be the case
but the member states failed to cooperate
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present i think
unlike the previous speaker who has now disappeared my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor
my colleague jankees wiebenga will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic
this i thought is no longer permissible certainly not at the moment
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly and this must be done at european level
mr president i too would like to thank the rapporteur
mrs theato s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions
yet every year we have the same problem
the court of auditors publishes its report which criticises the member states on account of various incidences of fraud
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year
having said all that i must say that unfortunately my group will not be voting for your report as a united front
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people
unfortunately however people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato s report receives more support
indeed we are talking about criminal law the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is and will be fierce
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are
but the idea of a european public prosecutor on the other hand aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters
moreover this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms
in this way a small european reform may hide a mediumsized one and a mediumsized one may hide a large one
the union for a europe of nations group on the other hand wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network
so the legal framework mr president is already in place
it is fine in principle
it need only be finetuned
mr president mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi the european police in the form of olaf
and indeed there is a twofold shift
next we have the puritan shift the teutonic europe of the north the europe of the lutherans calvinists and quakers wishes to inflict its moral order on us
basically the more we lose our grip on morals the more we tighten our grip on our wallet
mr president it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union more so these days than there used to be
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe s citizens
the intergovernmental conference  will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this
taking these aspects into account i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind as proposed and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf
mr president will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving eu funds
i do not believe so
on the other hand we can go a long way using the existing tools
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust as proposed at the last summit
in the way it is structured eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for
it is simply too bad and i can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor s office instead
however it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office
instead there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and especially change our practice
at the moment article  of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used
mr president we all want to do something about combating european fraud
but the question is now is the european union doing anything about it as well
the answer to this is that we know very little about this
the tampere summit was about combating crime
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but in reality we have made little progress
so a great deal has to be done in this area
and what exactly should be done
two things and mrs theato s report clearly spells these out
firstly the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union
so unification in this small area
the european public prosecutor s office is nothing to be afraid of
i feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on
it is in fact something very positive
parliament supports this
the committee of wise men supports this
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same
mr president i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about
we need a public debate on this
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law
article  of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud
we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events which in the past seemed to be the norm
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms
today we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country
mr president i would very much just like to add to two particular points
sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion but i digress
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato s report
i am referring to recommendations  and 
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis
we also face difficulties with regard to offences
nothing has changed there
as far as that is concerned i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome
mr president for years parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union s financial interests
nevertheless it raises some very basic questions
mr president the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged
to remedy this vigorous efforts are required
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently
we have more confidence in eurojust where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is however to find the right mix
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten s report
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision
this requires staff training more modern recruitment methods and above all openness and public control
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this
parliament is committed to this task which is something this report bears impressive witness to
yet as things stand only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point
as such i would ask you to give olaf s work your full support also in its present form
thank you commissioner schreyer
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
vote
parliament approved the commission proposal
heatonharris ppede
mr president on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rules of procedure namely rules  and  these are both about voting
that is quite right mr heatonharris i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it
in this particular case i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on
mr president i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands so to speak but go straight to the electronic voting system
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure
i know it takes longer but should we not always have a show of hands first
the commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it
the president declared the common position approved as amended
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
explanations of vote own resources
 fr the european union is apparently financed through four own resources
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us
furthermore the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying member states
this is a long way from offshoots such as the community criminal code  the european public prosecutor or a european police force with olaf
there is as yet no federal european tax
koch report a
in recent years the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably increasing the risk of accidents
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation
directive ec was a response to this requirement
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised
parliament voted in favour of this text
koch report a
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then
this included a number of interim conditions valid until  january 
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals
until then there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards
they may therefore continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation where there are no applicable european standards
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation
in offering this explanation of my vote therefore i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern
schroedter report a
not only the difference in income per capita but above all large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report i have this important reservation
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year

fr this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy
in order to reduce disparities between regions of course
jacques delors was accustomed to saying that the market was shortsighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities
mrs schroedter s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid
amended again as such by the schroedter report they are a step in the right direction
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after  but that is another subject
in the meantime let us support this first step
 this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some member states
although i wholeheartedly support this aim i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether
in my mind illegal state aid amounts to little more than statesponsored social dumping
illegal state aid by contrast destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment
in all such cases however strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling

the truth is though that the commission s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives

a considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time
this is why the midterm review provided for under article  of regulation  will be of considerable importance
in general the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent
in conclusion the document is not particularly satisfactory and in some aspects is disappointing
berend report a
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues
this obviously caused a slight reduction in the union s per capita gdp level
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions particularly regarding the information given to the european works council in existence since 
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment the environment and consumers into consideration
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect i abstained

this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states
but it does at least make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union
admittedly this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling
indeed the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system
moreover the von wogau report which the european parliament has just voted on supports it in so doing
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term
is this not indeed what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament
indeed this is one advantage of the present system
rapkay report a
the members of parliament from the lutte ouvriere party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power
this is repulsive most of all in social terms
do you imagine that the  million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy
we are convinced that the opposite is true and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive
excessive in comparison with what iron rule what criteria of efficiency
finally after seattle do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness
jonckheer report a
i am happy with the rapporteur s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition
admittedly an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union
clearly though it must be monitored a task which falls to the european commission
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german lander
like the rapporteur i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time which is to say in time for the ninth report
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid
in order to compensate for this situation the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us

just as the court of justice recognised in its order of  may  the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation
this indeed is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code
finally we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond

oil slick off the french coast
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission
mr president i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppede group but also as an elected representative for brittany and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events
together with mrs grossetete and the ppede group we tabled a motion for a resolution
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline and why
if i repeat we had had regulations of this type then this disaster would surely not have occurred
well if the charterer is exonerated then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for
the regulations must therefore be reviewed and i thank you commissioner for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations
moreover as you said monitoring must above all be stepped up that of the flag state that of the classification societies
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission
what are the conditions for this recognition
what guarantees are there of its reliability
you are going to commission a factfinding mission
we await the outcome with great interest
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries
why not
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for in this case the oil company
if the charterer s liability entails a financial commitment then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster
the time for resolutions has passed
what is now needed is action
mr president every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of europe
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as  birds perhaps mainly guillemots may have died
the pictures many of us will have seen of oilsoaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully
with every tide the volunteers members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick sticky black tar
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident
it is of course the responsibility of policies and therefore our responsibility to guarantee the safety of sea transport
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again
indeed we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many
we should be aware for example that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil
why in these circumstances is the liability of total as charterer not recognised
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance at last of the ban on degassing at sea
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently
in addition it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo as a matter of urgency
i can testify to this remarkable work
you are no doubt aware that approximately   birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick which is a major ecological disaster practically unprecedented in scale
in relation to this you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces
once again there will be no clearly defined party responsible
in the meantime it is nature that is taking the rap as always
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers
this is no longer tolerable
next we have flags of convenience
this is no longer tolerable
finally there is the lack of transparency
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility the identity of the owners and real decisionmakers as impenetrable as possible
this is no longer tolerable
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused
i am thinking specifically of totalfina in the present instance
this is an approach mr president which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation
in so doing it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which in this instance is awaiting clear tangible action
in this emergency in this ordeal we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity local solidarity national solidarity and intergovernmental solidarity
quite clearly we are now paying the price for our lack of concern
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility irresponsible charterers untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience that of a state applying for membership of the european union
in addition there are community directives but they are seldom applied if at all due to the insufficient number of national inspectors
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years but it is making very slow progress
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings
this must be brought forward
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities
thirdly a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future
this could be of a maximum of  years of age
thus the erika was refused access to american waters
if the european community had done the same a great disaster would have been avoided
mr president torrey canyon olympic bravery haven amoco cadiz gino tanio so many names we remember with horror
and now the erika
whose turn is next
twenty one years after amoco cadiz this umpteenth oil slick the seventh since  shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react for their capitulation to the multinationals
and this is the result
as an elected representative for the loireatlantique region unfortunately i can testify to this
there is nothing natural about these recurring disasters they are the result of fate
they are the result of human thoughtlessness
what we have here is an ecological disaster
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that
the erika disaster must be the last in the series
first of all we must shed some light on this shipwreck
next as a matter of urgency we muss pass legislation firstly regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported
in fact according to the experts the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast
we know what actually happened
this would be a minimum requirement i believe on the dawn of the third millennium
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks the  clearly do not suffice
these guarantee  making no claim to be exhaustive  a minimum of  things
this is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation
however we must aim higher in the longterm let there be no mistake about that
in other words we need real costeffectiveness for our entire energy supply system
mr president may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear adequate and at the same time very firm response
many thanks for this
the damage suffered also in ecological terms cannot be expressed in money
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members
what i learned is that actually there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner
first of all the portstate control according to which  of all ships require inspection
but this is not in place
mr president i would welcome some action in this area
in my opinion we should look further into this point and i also think that the marpol treaty which comes into effect in  should be looked at very closely
mr president we have already had this discussion so many times in the past
so what are we to do now
i have no intention of talking about past events rather i want to look to the future
what are we to do now
i will tell you a few things we should do
of course we need doublehulled vessels
that goes without saying but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term
so what do we need to happen immediately
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle
this is what we need for ships
thirdly we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports that is in every port of the european union
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability
we need to be sure that if need be the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability
environmental standards will be a recurring theme
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports
the unions will have something to say as will industry
a long memory will serve us well ladies and gentlemen
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement
just you go home and say  we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date 
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years time
mr president mrs rothbehrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts
we have now obtained a firstrate enumeration of a variety of measures
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had
we must also critically examine the classification societies
i do not think that we can accept their procedures
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control
within the commission the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions
in these circumstances even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations capacity to cause damage
however we must stick to the facts
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken
i cannot accept this
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous
secondly i also share the commissioner s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path
that is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit
there are reputable companies too
it could have sunk anywhere
my first thoughts are for the  indian sailors who were saved but of whom nothing has been said
there could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means above all men s lives
by now they are far away
it is a miracle that they were saved
things could well continue in the same way
then sanctions must be harmonised between the  member states they should not be different but the same throughout the union
we must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience not because they are necessarily bad boats but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones
perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches getting a nice tan
we would like to know their names and their faces
finally there must be improvements in the training of crews
in our society there is no such thing as zerorisk but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety
mr president i welcome the statement from the commissioner
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection
i come from a region galicia which has suffered similar accidents in the past
i therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways
on the other hand prevention is essential
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea
in addition i should like to make a number of comments
that should be the starting point for our efforts
once we have done that our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues
i am referring to the double hull which consists of two layers of steel with containers divided into two tanks
commissioner i believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard
any costbenefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents is bound to support this approach
i think that given the dramatic circumstances and as a matter of principle it would be illadvised and inappropriate to hold several votes
we sometimes regulate things which could by and large remain subsidiary
in this area we must respond to public opinion
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are when all is said and done on the global scale merely a peninsula
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection
states can carry out port inspections
however it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation
in my opinion the commissioner is quite right
where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors esteemed european commission
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored
in short to give priority to older substandard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements
the erika was built at a japanese shipyard and is singlehulled
there are four more sister ships in service at present
some of them also sail under the maltese flag
are we waiting for the next accident to happen
would sanctions not be appropriate as the commissioner stated for the classification society
rina is currently the talk of the town
malta is entering the accession negotiations
like so many others i too wonder where the people responsible are
where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks whether intentional or unintentional
the president cut the speaker off
i would like to thank mrs grossetete and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab
ultimately the polluter must pay
the victims are waiting outside
they want answers
the citizens are right to ask do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever
who will provide us with new jobs
that is why i welcome mrs palacio s action plan with open arms
it is equally important to note that prevention is better than cure 
but there is an art to that as well
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew
we are therefore right to demand improved controls sanctions and preventive measures
the issue is as topical as it was before
mrs rothbehrendt said that nothing had ever been done
in fact i believe that things have been done by the commission but there is still more to do
during these years the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport
that is the reality
flags of convenience are one problem but are not the only one
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end
we already have legislation
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable we will never in my opinion resolve these problems
i will end now
i will not expand further we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions
thank you very much commissioner
we have taken good note of your intentions
i have received  motions for resolution in accordance with rule  to close the present commission statement
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  pm
storms in europe
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission
i think that you must have done so because you have not mentioned it
we should therefore put this situation right immediately
you also know that this will not only be a shortterm problem but also a medium and longterm one
let me explain
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around  of deciduous forest
indeed for some forestry districts which have lost  of their trees this represents a huge loss
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over  years
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one
indeed you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster
they have earned the confidence of their fellowcitizens
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies which have been particularly badly hit
beyond this i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on  january 
i can show you a copy if you wish
mr president commissioner europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region lorraine which have suffered enormous destruction
i welcome mr barnier s statement and i also welcome the measures which the commission has announced
the community action programme for civil protection established by a council decision on  december was launched on  january 
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity this programme must work at full capacity
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads and to repair them as quickly as possible
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure
finally it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry
current programmes must be accelerated
for example as they stand the commission s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under kyoto
the trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem it shelves it
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate
commissioner mr president lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto
however it has now achieved notoriety
the wind triumphed over electricity pylons roofs traffic signs and ultimately over the forest
the thinningout we need is not being attended to the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree
mr president commissioner permit me first of all to make reference to two facts
we are now endeavouring at huge cost to get the country back on its feet again and help its people and rightly so
secondly at the end of  unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the eu
the commission in brussels responded to the victims cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders
we do not have the wherewithal for that they said
this is wrong
and no one can comprehend this attitude
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity also from within this community
i say they have a right to solidarity
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms
it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment
then for example people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart
when in  over five years ago that is i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission which will actually enable me to start work
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be
of course there is a need for solidarity here
of course i am in favour of providing assistance where we can
but when it comes to aid we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate
to this day we in europe remain in the privileged position of having the gulf stream and the gulf stream still does its stuff
america and southeast asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream
but in common with others we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference
mr president i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims
this is an irreparable loss
as i have little time mr president i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution
i believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not
in fact over the last decade the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals
furthermore we should utilise an extraordinary budget line since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation
first of all we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this
that is important
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past
it was very small
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished
i think we should reinstate this budget line
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now
these are major disasters we should have an instrument we do not have it
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these
ladies and gentlemen none of us must forget what has taken place
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul
nevertheless the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow
the calculations are in decades rather than years
i am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are also prepared
the president cut the speaker off
mr president i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland
i talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water
natural habitats were destroyed
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe
unfortunately we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission
at my hearing last september i promised speedy delivery of this white paper
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission s green paper on food law was published
the most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of europe
in an industry worth some eur  billion annually even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects
between the agrofood sector and the farming sector there are over  million employees
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness
the challenge is to make the system the very best
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders
all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent understandable and flexible
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers
over  measures are envisaged
our objective is to put in place a coherent and uptodate body of food law by the end of 
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by  as an essential complement to the new food safety regime
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate
it has already attracted much comment including reactions from members of parliament
we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change
the first key concern is independence
key stakeholders including consumers are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests
we must also ensure excellence and transparency
however the commission believes that we must go further
we must create a permanent and truly independent excellent and transparent system of risk assessment
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority
however if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs this would clearly not be enough
as the white paper makes clear the new authority must be a valueadded structure
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority
i make no apology for this approach i firmly believe that it is the correct one
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give lawmaking powers to such an authority
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority
i also reject this line of argument
would this be in the interests of europe s citizens
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving
this is a major task
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science
however with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies the authority will become preeminent on the european stage
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena
these could include withholding community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a member state
it sets out over  separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation
however having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees i recognise that this was not feasible
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate
parliament played a crucial role in europe s response to the bse crisis
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens concerns about food safety issues to the fore
i expect that parliament s contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu s food safety regime in the years ahead
it is essential that we get the mix right
mr president i thank the commissioner for his statement
that is very much the right approach
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight
i hope that we can thrash this out
it is very important that we include liability in that process
that is the one word i am talking about
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong
that cannot continue
mr president it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed
you are unclear about this in your white paper
what is your schedule how long will it take you to produce a positive list
the final part of my question is as follows when will bse testing be binding in all member states
that is another point ie the question of obligation which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper
thank you commissioner for your statement
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency so there is not very much point in your proposing one
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this
president first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern mrs rothbehrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability
once that is done issues such as liability can be addressed
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration
mrs rothbehrendt asked me about establishing a positive list
at the moment the list is as i say a negative list and it is added to as required
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it  in fact
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind
i also welcome the white paper
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location
in addition to that the food safety authority will have a board
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board
i envisage that the board s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that
that is an issue for consideration and discussion
there may be a number of views on that
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out
mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile
it must be visible
it must be known
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous
it must be visible
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level
that is an undesirable situation we do not want that situation in the future
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence  lack of information is one
this situation can be achieved over a period of time
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence it is something that is earned over a period of time
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process
in relation to grants and subsidies yes consideration has been given to that issue
mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority
the food safety authority s situation is quite different
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located
that is my judgement at the moment
colleagues i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had  minutes of response by the commissioner and his statement
as you can see halfanhour is not really anything like enough time for such a session
that concludes the debate
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event
first part
question no  by h
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission
according to our information the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weaponsgrade material
thank you for your reply
i should like to make the following points turkey is now a candidate country
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 
so much for the political aspect
in cases such as this where there is uncertainty simulators are used
however we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy
in this sense all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this
i have explained the position of the commission
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety
in the case of turkey it is different
the plant is not yet there
i have already said that turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears
i do not have these concerns
question no  by h
if not why not
mrs wallstrom has the floor on behalf of the commission
thank you mr bowe for your question
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf factfinding mission
however this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed
first of all mr president can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons
thank you mr bowe for that question
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium
that is also mentioned in the report
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted
it also has a longterm effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system
i cannot answer that question
when it comes to medical checks and so on i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information
question no  by h
many of the refugees had been severely frostbitten and many had died along the way
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama
i urge the chinese again to do so
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities
but for my part i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys however worthy the cause
imprisonment torture the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council
as it happens we deal with the budgetary consequences the council makes the appointment
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama
it is an extremely moving account not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well
the commission like others has urged dialogue
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama
question no  by h
are these reports accurate
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate
in november  the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission s administration with the public
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman s office
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself
mr president i would like to thank the commissioner
however i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 
the newspaper reports were misleading
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved
both documents that is the commission s document and the ombudsman s draft cover largely the same ground
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis
as the author is not present question no  lapses
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy i am sorry
according to the rules of procedure you are not required to reply
i wish you a good evening
second part
questions to mr nielson who is replaced by mr patten
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory
it is not to be brought in as a sort of optional addon 
in addition measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender
it would appear that we are in agreement about this
if the latter do not have the required professional competence then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority
only one manager has participated in gender training and for half a day
that is naturally unacceptable
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training
this limited training element has however been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times
that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said
since  the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme
in  and  kyrgyzstan kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur  million
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent tajikistan
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur  million in  and 
over the same period kyrgyzstan received eur  million
mr president commissioner there is a risk of central asia and the caspian sea becoming the balkans of the st century
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side
but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia
i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well
so the honourable member s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to
we also take good note of the fact that the member who has asked the question has applauded the commissioner s answer
this is not the usual state of affairs
and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time
thank you very much mr patten for your interventions today
question no  by h
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made
thank you commissioner for your reply
you tell me that you as the commission have made recommendations
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendations will be adhered to
however my question for a very long time has been this what happened with previous policies
did anyone find work
how many people found work
if you cannot tell us for this year then last year and the year before
what has been done about training
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees
do we have any figures
in other words do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece
greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and as far as i can see an increase in productivity
the action which the commission can take relates to the specific guidelines
as you know there are  guidelines on which each country is evaluated
question no  by h
some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question
i think that the answer is brief and clear
of course it is as you say
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark that is not where the problem lies
the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark
question no  by h
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of nonconsultant hospital doctors
parliament has proposed  years the commission  and the council 
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure
question no  by h
which commissioners are members of this group
how many meetings of the group have been held to date
what concrete measures have been discussed
this question covers several individual matters
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality
the commissioners taking part are president prodi vicepresident kinnock mr reding and myself
the meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on  january 
mrs avilesperea that was an exhortation rather than a question
but if the commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions 
question no  by h
under this umbrella each member state is to submit proposals in the form of a community initiative programme for that particular country
what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states programmes
the equal initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace
this is an important aspect of this initiative
it has been submitted to parliament and we expect parliament s opinion next month
the last question concerns the amount granted
question no  by h
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about
this is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression
in other words it is positive discrimination
in the example which you mentioned it is only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable
question no  by h
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget
i should point out that  of funding for the period  ie eur  billion will go to the lessfavoured regions of europe
commissioner thank you for giving me a wellintentioned answer which has been rigorous and wellargued
however i can assure you that we do not with the existing measures  which you have referred to  reach these severely lessfavoured regions
i am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to
i can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies
question no  by h
these discussions have already started but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon
these results will be most important in shaping the commission s social programme
secondly there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented
question no  by h
what measures is the commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area
on  november  the european commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination
i would thank the commissioner for her answer
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe
i am grateful for the fact that the commission has adopted an action plan
it has not yet been passed by the council it is at the consultation stage
i think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at european level
i think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport
question no  by h
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements
if not will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission s questions expired on  december  and we have not received a reply
we are waiting to see what the next move will be
firstly no attempt is being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country
five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage
and this is the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine governments to move
thank you very much commissioner for your dedication
you have fulfilled your objective for today which is to answer all the questions
we congratulate you
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed questions  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes question time
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
 discharge
the commissioner mrs schreyer is not here yet but i hope and expect that she will arrive in the next few minutes
mr president i am sure that mrs schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise
this report therefore appears at a crucial time on the eve of mr kinnock s reforms
it is an excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce farreaching reforms to these plans
we asked for a whistleblower s regulation and this is now in place
parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated
this has now been done
parliament requires a code of conduct for commissioners and cabinets
this is in place too
parliament asked the commission to waive its excessive privileges
it did this as well
the commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with parliament in terms of sem 
fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices
we want more than that however
the commission should now produce an ambitious and farreaching reform programme
we now demand from the european commission clear pledges concerning the following points
firstly parliament must have complete access to all commission documents
this however presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents
if the current draft is correct then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents
ultimately we also need to achieve better cooperation of course between the european court of auditors and its national counterparts
i would quote gaza as an example
mr president since  the discharge has acquired a heavy political significance
it is one of the most powerful weapons parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care
this is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow
however we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place
as long as we have no status we are not credible as a force for reforming the union the reforms of the european institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue europe s development process
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic
all institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of europe
they were not unique to  and two strands seem to run through them
that cannot excuse everything that we came across
citizens of europe expect the european institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so
from what i have seen of the reform process it looks good
i saw some of mr kinnock s papers today i heard some of what he had to say
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need
but we need that reform process
many of the general points raised in our committee s report have been covered in mrs van der laan s report
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it
it groups them together and that is very important
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to
one is nuclear safety in eastern europe
we have to get this right
the committee of independent experts said the commission was not managing this properly
we have to remedy that
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending
it has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible
the socialist group will be voting to grant discharge
i am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well
but that is not to say that we are satisfied and that everything in the garden is rosy
it is clear that a radical overhaul of the commission is long overdue
it indicates however that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction
i just want to outline some of the issues that we as socialists have put down as amendments
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform
first of all the immunity of officials this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor
we need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption
it is critical to note that the commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the court of auditors
i have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the commission
even if we hear nothing else we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see
we want to see that followthrough to a much greater extent in future
the other issue is access to confidential documents
we have put down an amendment to that effect
one issue which is referred to in the van der laan report is the whole question of the gaza hospital
the situation there is totally unacceptable
we will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue
i would like to congratulate lousewies van der laan
mr president commissioner if we are honest we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation
we are discussing last year s discharge but also the commission s responsibility
i would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed
it is about a commission which is no more
there is now a new commission
then it is logical to grant discharge because how can the current commissioner be blamed where  is concerned
the problems remain and this gives rise to doubts
mr kinnock will present his proposal next month
we are all very much anticipating this but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled
this dilemma stretches beyond the areas which i have already listed
take for example the pledges made by the commission they look good in themselves
i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them
the previous speaker already said something about this
this is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results
this also applies to whistleblowers
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type
so there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made
clear progress must be visible
at present we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposals but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so
finally mr president the  discharge was the beginning of the end of the last commission
in that year we voted against granting discharge
as a result we shall vote against granting discharge for  too
we think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the court of auditors
it is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised
so far the promises which have been made are still however to be fulfilled especially where transparency is concerned
we are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution but against the granting of discharge
the union for a europe of nations group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 
the report on socalled discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts
we support these critical remarks and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd against this background to vote in favour of approving the accounts
we do not think that the new commission under any circumstances could incur liability for the past
we think it is wrong to talk about the commission s liability as an institution
it was the  accounts which led to the downfall of the previous commission and the  accounts are just as incriminating
there is no reason why against this background we should agree to grant discharge
that is just the way things are however
in taking over the mandate the new commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made
this question ought to have been asked when the new commission was appointed
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission presents its reform programme
in response to this the commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures
existing eu treaties will be amended so as to ensure for example that the enlargement process can succeed
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate
mr president the commission is now to obtain its discharge for  but in reality it does not deserve it
 was a matter for the old commission and therefore the new commission does not think that it can accept liability
the old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one s friends unfortunately still exists
i am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving echo
i am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter
from the outside it looks as if the commission has something to hide
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case
the commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the commission
it was this practice which led to the commission s downfall
thank you commissioner schreyer
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
response to second report of committee of independent experts
within a few hours of the presentation of the report president santer announced the resignation of his entire team
the new commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function
a code of conduct for commissioners and their private offices has been adopted
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials
the number of departments has been reduced
the commission in my opinion has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated
in order to achieve this action is required in four areas
first financial management and control within the commission must be improved
one of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control
the commission s dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure including financial control
a new independent audit system service must be set up
in return for this greater degree of autonomy managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions
it is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes
urgent change is required today
a proposal can be made a proposal should be made on the basis of article  of the treaty by the middle of this year
third standards in european public life must be upheld
a number of codes have since been introduced
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding
whistleblowers who act in good faith must be protected
at the end of last year mr kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistleblowers
they must be implemented without delay
although such measures can never be an alternative for good management they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong
crucially reforms must not be limited to the commission
parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules administrative procedures and management practices
finally the commission s human resource policy must be modernised
it is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern multinational organisation
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive
too many young new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years
merit must be recognised and rewarded specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade
the promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent
last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions
commissioner kinnock will tomorrow present his communication on reform
this communication must contain a clear timetable
enlargement of the union is just a few years away
in june of last year europe s voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism
there is a very simple way to deal with those stories
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism
i would point out that there is no european legal system but that a different legal system exists in each member state
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways
our greatest concern in the epp is to ensure that public confidence in the european commission is restored
this was after all one of the causes of the downfall of the last commission
have the lessons not been learnt
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men s report should be implemented
commissioner you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occurred
in a nutshell there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available
our position was made very clear on this topic in the  budget
mr president i must start by apologising that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report
it is an excellent report
it is right for us to have a focused report which is what mr van hulten has produced
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his efforts so far
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility
it is clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation
that is important
we need to stop people passing the buck from one to another
where failure is occurring within the commission we need to hold people responsible
we need to be assured that consistent underperformance must lead to dismissal
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission
i will give you one example of this
it is clear that is not acceptable
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit
we recognise that most of the officials within the commission are extremely hardworking
but we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones
the european parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history
we have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves
our own staff policy is outdated
some of our working practices need radical reform
i hope that the european parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the commission in this reform process
we recognise the proposals on activitybased budgeting
finally can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public
european taxpayers need to be reassured
the fate of the commission of the whole european union rests on delivery of this reform
that is the key issue delivery of these proposals
mr president i would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur mr van hulten on his first report
i very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments
we have submitted an amendment to this effect
firstly i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents
the commission s records leave a great deal to be desired
we noticed this when we had to investigate the flechard affair which as it happens has still not been sorted out
i would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control
the general impression at present is that anything budgetrelated within europe is bad
is this possible
i would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out
if we admit new member states then we need to put our own house in order first
mr president i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten
it is his first report here in plenary
this is worth a compliment although i regret of course that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue
it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late
in my opinion this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control
let us be honest
the second report of the wise men arrived in september
we are now four months down the line
meanwhile mr van hulten has been inundated with amendments more than  amendments in the first round
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed too extensive and too late
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening
in any case it should be clear that my group of course fully backs the recommendations made by the committee of wise men
in any event i look forward to the document which was approved by the commission today
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february
mr president this report is positive but actually we need more than this
fraud mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere
they are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow
via the structural funds a great deal of the european budget is being pumped around the system
but there is also funding which is being pumped via brussels back to the same rich member states
after each incident of improper use of this money and certainly after fraud the call for stricter control is more pronounced
even the strictest control cannot solve this problem
it would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a european detour
mr president when it comes to putting its own house in order the european commission is in a catch situation
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this chamber sound the more applause they receive
allow me to start with the most important demand
we do not want financial control to be abolished
the commission is sending out the wrong signals here by renaming the directorategeneral for financial control as the directorategeneral for audits for example
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked
mr president firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague mr van hulten
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report
mr president the commission s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy
the call to make a cultural uturn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one
this is the best support we can give to european democracy
mr president first of all congratulations to michiel van hulten for his first report
mr van hulten i think you deserve a medal for your efforts
there are two points which in my opinion deserve special attention on the part of the eldr
firstly there is the commissioners individual responsibility
this must be regulated during the igc
this will contribute hugely towards reestablishing the confidence of the european citizens in this institution
only when all european institutions are reformed will we have the open democratic and decisive europe which our citizens now finally deserve
mr president i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the house
at this stage there can be no delay in the process of reforming the commission demanded by our citizens
this parliament has often heard the desire to reform the commission expressed even by its presidents
it now appears that this desire is more serious
this parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme
we want a strong commission which can act in an independent and neutral manner but with political sense
commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office
therefore the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties
perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise
therefore the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order
naturally this is only to be welcomed
and so it is the two key principle that applies here
a single key is to suffice in future
what we really need to focus on however is making the checks more effective
it is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all
the officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis that is in the operational directoratesgeneral amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and timeconsuming
however the financial controllers must work independently
that is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the commission when it talks in terms of decentralisation
it is obviously the commission s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual directoratesgeneral but this is precisely what we do not want
therefore independence is prerequisite for effective checks
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control subscribes to
i believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow s vote
mrs theato has already expressed as much and i am only too willing to support her in this regard
mr president a couple of years ago the previous commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures
this was stupid of the old commission and parliament was of no help on that occasion
there are too many rights too many regulations and too little room for leadership
there is no backbone and no teeth
where is the beef
and i would also say this to you commissioner please deliver the beef even if it is british
romano prodi promised a revolution
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues the ones where it hurts
sort out the tangle of staff allowances
stand firm on the demand for mobility not as a right as it says here in the report but as a management tool
ensure too that training becomes a management tool
do not listen to the report s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed
it is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis
we have not done this so far and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing
mr president i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i voted for it
so i refer to the things i do not agree with
i do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to parliament
this report is about the commission
parliament is a separate subject
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission
in addition to that there is the question of dutyfree
that was a stick used to beat the commission by the dutyfree lobbies who resented the fact that the commission abolished dutyfree in airports
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either
most of the report is about financial control
that is reasonable because it comes from the budgetary control committee
but we should not create the impression that vast amounts of european resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the european commission
after all it is only  of gdp by comparison with national spending
so carelessness within the commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money
we should get it into perspective
it is important to remember that
the business of the european commission is very little about spending money
they have very little of it
they have a much wider responsibility
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust
if there is we have generated it in this house in the past year
i have been here for  years and found absolute trust between the council the commission and parliament
that is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were
mr president i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work
the commission s administration simply does not function particularly well
there is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy
the financial regulation should be amended
we agree that we should have better control of the finances
it is just a question of how
the commission and the committee of independent experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control
we should be careful about this
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control
it is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through
instead we should be reforming and decentralising control
the commission does not have enough staff
and the commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs
the staffing system is too rigid
there should be a more frequent rotation of employees especially at the top of the hierarchy
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees
i am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed
after all the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms
perhaps this is a little worrying
first of all we need tough regulations which can be implemented
codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough
what we need then are basic administrative regulations for the eu for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states
these are what are missing
we have asked for a public prosecutor s office and criminal law but we also need administrative law for the eu
the van hulten report is a step in the right direction but it is not enough
secondly we must also clarify our own auditing roles
it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation
we do not hunt down criminals that is olaf s job
tell me what national parliament for example is handed all preliminary investigation documents
mr president i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report
i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement also with its amendments
a very important proposal indeed
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale
i do not know whether this is to appease mr kinnock but i happen to know mr kinnock
he is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary
in my opinion such a farreaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary
finally the issue of officials
actually i do not entirely share mr haarder s view
i do agree that the section on officials has in fact been completed totally inadequately
these two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table
the experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the commissioners from belonging to political groups
this lesson in wisdom is  ideology and  knowledge
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions
the van hulten report started out as a brilliant one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieved
please therefore accept what i am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer
this report seems to me to be redundant longwinded confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used
perhaps redundant is the most serious epithet and you are not responsible for this it is the responsibility of this parliament
meanwhile we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence
longwinded 
i am not going to mention the length of this report
it is also confusing 
i am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning parliament
mr president the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them
the concept of transparency stands out in the report
securing this is a major priority
the importance of smoothrunning comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough
this is not just about bureaucratic reform however rather it is about showing good will towards the citizens
we must win back their faith in eu politics
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them
this is what enables them to understand what is going on
they want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served
whether or not the reforms succeed depends to a very large extent on the commission s own initiative
so if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this house
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary
i am sure that mr pomes ruiz is encouraged by that
there is nothing therefore that is openended or vague about the report which i have had the honour to compile
i would say to mr elles that we are most definitely in listening mode
hence the transmission
turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations
that most certainly is the intention of the commission
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform
several members have made that point again in the course of today s debate
parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital
change in the law is fundamental
that service will open on  may this year
it will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation
as budgets commissioner here responsibilities already include relations with the court of auditors
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous followup to internal audits
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them
the proposed change will make the systems more effective both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called a big bang approach
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa
it was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control
in addition i do not believe that paragraph  fully reflects the opinion of the court of auditors in 
i do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this
i take it from paragraph  that the underlying preoccupation of honourable members is that there should be a carefully managed transition
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable members will see when they read the reform strategy document
since june of last year the olaf regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities
the possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed
we are seeking to implement best practice
as a corollary there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations
a communication later this year will give full details
i do not think parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness fairness consistency and professionalism
a communication in june will set out the full proposal for change
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house
with the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life
that is in line with the draft resolution
i welcome parliament s support for that
the draft resolution rightly recalls the commission s accountability to this parliament
president prodi and vicepresident de palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the commission s practical commitment to that
the point was very properly raised by mr elles and referred to by mrs thors
i am sure they are aware that in middecember we officially received the draft framework agreement with parliament
we are now waiting for parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house
the early thoughts of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome
that is most certainly relevant
it is very clear however that parts of the commission services are already very stretched
parliament has frequently made that point
secondly it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology
thirdly it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken
they are already having implications for resource availability
the commission therefore welcomes paragraph  of mr van hulten s report
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
the sitting was closed at  pm
middle east peace process continuation
the next item is the continuation of the council and commission statements on the middle east peace process
such is life
so i hope i can count on the understanding of the house on this occasion
it is not something i assure you which i would wish to make a practice of
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict
a fair and indeed generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm elsheikh memorandum
although there has been some slippage i trust that the remaining israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon
honourable members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track
we are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development
i look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again
nor is our role confined to that of banker
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region
but we should not kid ourselves a comprehensive middle east peace deal comes with a hefty price tag
the commission is already considering the implications for the european union of the recent encouraging developments
we intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with parliament and council soon
we are the largest of all donors to the palestinians
we have also offered very substantial support to jordan lebanon syria and egypt
with the israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them
in this context let me applaud the important steps that the palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency
president arafat will be meeting the council of ministers next week
the commission is actively involved in those efforts
the commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between israelis and arabs
we committed more than eur  million for such projects last year
i want to underline that point
we have made progress in recent months and weeks as mr gama mentioned earlier
but it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way
i hope the house will understand that
mr president commissioner patten has our understanding
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation
i honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation
in this sense i share commissioner patten s positive attitude
let me explain it is true that the israeli government has delayed the third handover of west bank territory to the palestinian authorities
this is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks as prime minister barak has promised
there is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the president of the european parliament to the region will contribute to this
mr president i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account
i should like to say that i agree with the tone which galeote quecedo s speech set here
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process
it is of course a peace process which is finally under way
i want to emphasise four points
while the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun i think it is important to keep the two processes apart
the second point relates to syria
there the border question is obviously central
how negotiations are proceeding there we still do not know
what is important however is that they have begun
an important question in this context is the future distribution of water
as things are at present the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel s water supply
there too of course outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugees
my last point concerns the future palestinian state
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year with or without israel s support
the barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party
this is something to which we all want to contribute
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east
it is therefore regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being
indeed both parties will need to make huge efforts
it is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union s common foreign and security policy
this is where mr solana the high representative to the council could come into his own
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation
there are still needless to say many unresolved problems and unanswered questions also involving the palestinians
the moment of truth is approaching
will israel let palestinian refugees return or be given compensation
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and therefore reliable as a partner in peace
will syria fully accept israel s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law
peace in the middle east concerns us all however
it is therefore good that the eu should act as a godparent to the palestinian state
but today egypt jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel
it is high time there was peace in the middle east
i refer principally to the palestineisrael question but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since  and in southern lebanon since 
however israel is not the only country concerned with security
trees have been uprooted houses are still being demolished and above all water supplies have been reduced or refused especially in east jerusalem while the settlements continue and are growing constantly
all the international community has to do is implement resolutions    and 
i was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between israel and syria had been suspended
nevertheless we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the middle east of late
the settlers at the golan heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security
if syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the israelsyria question might be promising
the key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment as well as the transfer of territories
currently both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed
indeed the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability
oz s impression is also echoed in the israeli press
surely assad would be barak s ideal negotiating partner and not the foreign affairs minister
and the israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of minister farouk alshara in shepherdstown
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak was plainly insulting
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory
well the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face
at the end of the day israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the golan
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process
i would like to finish off by asking the european council and commission a question
the suspension of the talks between syria and israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment
what can the european union do in these circumstances
unfortunately very little
first i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authorities
but we have enough agreements now oslo wye plantation sharm elsheikh
we have enough agreements they just need to be implemented
my second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between syria and israel
i consider this to be very encouraging news
that would be a similar situation
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution
dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july  the date promised by ehud barak
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbours to the north
we really hope and believe so
never have the parties been so determined
following the attack in hadera on monday we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism
at midday mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region
despite everything we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of washington
like other arab countries before them the syrians chose the americans to sponsor the negotiations
it has also reached a political agreement  and we congratulate them on this  on the initial proposals for civil cooperation
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework
they have been put into the hands of a single commissioner mr antonio vitorino and we congratulate them on this as well
it is as if the council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to the other begrudges
despite all the commitments made at the highest level the council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament
i said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the council and the policies actually carried out
schengen has been incorporated as we said earlier into the acquis but it has been done with very little transparency
the same is true with regard to immigration policy
we have amused ourselves with a pile of reports but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives they have disappeared
we hope that  will be the year for action in the same way that  was the year for expectations
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union
alternatively it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions in order to move forward in another way
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit thus preparing for the future
our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime
we are familiar with parliament s views and we know that parliament is aware of the views of the council s legal advisers
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union
the union s commitment to establishing an area of freedom security and justice was confirmed at tampere
 was also marked by the german presidency s initiative to draw up a european charter of fundamental rights
in addition to these events i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 
it is for the public therefore that we are developing the area of freedom security and justice
in the coming weeks i shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project
and we hope during the portuguese presidency to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council taking account of the soundings that i have just mentioned
the year  also marks the start of the implementation of the european union drugs strategy 
i should like to raise three points which for us as members of the ppe group must be focal points when such an area is created
first a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed
unfortunately however it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions
similarly it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda
secondly the introduction of a europewide fight against organised crime including by europol and eurojust
the planned introduction of eurojust is one of our significant successes from tampere and must now be implemented forthwith
we welcome the fact that europol has finally been able to start work
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament without hampering the work of europol
thirdly the extension to parliament s rights in this context
we want an area of freedom security and justice for the citizens of europe not against them
i just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress
the first is asylum
decisions on asylum should take months  not years
let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom not just about repression
the last area i want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems
arrested and released in madrid he is now being extradited after arrest in lisbon
whatever the eurosceptics say it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters
i hope that it works out
numerous questions are still outstanding
answers are still awaited
since tampere there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding
on the other hand quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life
the creation of a charter of fundamental rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future
the europol agreement has now officially entered into force
in tampere the question of granting operational powers was discussed
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control
the agreement also attracts criticism with regard to eurodac
parliament has amended the contractual text
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament s modus operandi
unfortunately no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them
europe as an area of freedom security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors
and yet we owe this to the citizens of europe
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this
we are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom security and justice particularly social justice
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems
this is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylumseekers are no longer acceptable
all asylumseekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect
they were treated like the worst criminals
they were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair surrounded by a horde of state security police
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour
our role should be to accompany reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed
instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund we could take the decision to set this up
the laws against racism must be harmonised
what direction do you intend to give to article  of the ec treaty
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women
how do you aim to eradicate homophobia racism and sexism
we must take the best from each of our countries
immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylumseekers
mr president there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security freedom and justice
the level of racism in our society is terrifying
and our current eu mantra is afsj area for freedom security and justice
and who is not in favour of security freedom and justice
a system of this kind is not something the eu can introduce without society s sustaining damage as a result
but it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security freedom and justice
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen
that is already secured by means of the various national legal systems
it is concerned with increased integration which as part of a duplicitous package involves increased repression and control
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning fort europa schengen eurodac etc any democrat can spot two key problems
first of all the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic
how is it envisaged that the eu s institutions which are already stretched well beyond their capacity can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition
it also of course finds indirect expression in the question
but secondly the projects will put a strain on indeed will be injurious to the national democracies
as long as the eu revolved around the internal market only the body was being attacked now it is the soul
mr president today the people of northern ireland see a strange irony
let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed
in  we had  murders
in  we had  murders and that does not include the omagh bomb where  were killed and  injured
between  and  loyalists assaulted and shot  people while republicans assaulted and shot  people
charges brought against loyalists in  totalled  while those against republicans totalled 
mr president that situation cannot continue and needs remedying
mr president the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union
my third and final point relates to the external activities of the union in the field of immigration and asylum
finally in relation to the charter of fundamental rights the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship
the euro employment even security are not enough
they need a european soul  as a distinguished spanish professor once said
mr president unlike some of the previous speakers i want to go back to the words of our portuguese ministers and mr vitorino
this trio s words were like music to our ears as mr ceyhun has said
as with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months
the tune that will be played will be one that the people of europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for an area of freedom security and justice in the european union
one area though is extremely important and this house must be involved in it namely scrutiny
and we must make certain that the details are applicable appropriate and relevant to the different countries
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about
mr schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of scoreboard 
anyone who is english or british or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is
i am sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that is so
at the end of six months i hope that the music is still playing and that the european people are still listening
i would like to make three brief points
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament
involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process
my second point is that we need a properly resourced commission
we have established a new directorategeneral yet it has only  people all told
there is an agreement to double this number but i understand that so far not a single new person has arrived
we are setting the commission a massive task not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs
all good things come in threes especially in our policy area
the role of the court of justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete
the unilateral decision by belgium to reestablish border controls is a clear illustration of this
we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of nonrefoulement no turning back
however the main concern remains 
the president cut the speaker off
i thank them for their statements to the house
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on  december
mr president esteemed gentlemen from portugal especially the council representatives you face great expectations on our part
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment
i refer to eurodac
we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality
even in tampere we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed you will be doing us a great service
from what i have said it must be obvious to you that the european parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration
i have great expectations for the portuguese presidency
but i want to add a word of caution
there are also courts in karlsruhe london lisbon dublin and edinburgh
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense
we need in short to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these
but we must look always to subsidiarity
madam president ladies and gentlemen i would very quickly like to make one point various members raised questions about the portuguese presidency
sustained applause
thank you minister
the debate is closed
mr president i am grateful for the council s oral and also written reply
their efficiency has been truly remarkable
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the commission as well
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control
representatives of the council within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament
question time council
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the council
question no  by h
thank you for your answer
however i would just like to add the following
turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by  with this unit
my second point concerns the safety of these plants
however we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation it is just not possible
with this in mind it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes
that is our role and this is the point of my question
i recognise the relevance of the arguments that mr souladakis has put forward
this is of course a highly sensitive issue
this question will naturally be one of our key concerns and the european commission will not fail to take this into account
thank you mr president and thank you presidentinoffice of the council
however forgive me if i am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me
i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information
however i would like to say mr newton dunn that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable
i do not consider that the council tried to answer my question
i did not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission has still not tabled
instead my question concerns the interpretation in principle of article  of the treaty of amsterdam
i should like to have an answer to that question
mr sjostedt the answer that i gave was the only answer possible
nevertheless i would like to say that any interpretation of article  of the treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity
does not the council s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decisionmaking process
as a matter of fact at the last conference this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference
the matter is still open
for our part we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area
it is a very important question indeed which jonas sjostedt and others have asked
we are very anxious indeed that the eu too should move in this direction and this is also stated in the treaty of amsterdam
one or two years ago parliament adopted a report by mrs loow which is extremely important in this context
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament
i listened very carefully to what mr seixas da costa had to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference which would mean widening the agenda
mr dimitrakopoulos transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions
it must therefore be able to count on the support of the members of the european parliament who will surely rally behind this proposal
we will then see at ministerial level how we can follow this up
the question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency
as far as we are concerned they will be
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter
question no  by h
the council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refers
without this transfer from portuguese waters the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to france
that is why i think that this is quite positive from portugal s point of view
mr presidentinoffice of the council i must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all
i understand that portugal is affected by this
in concrete terms   tonnes represent  of portugal s fishing opportunities in  against   tonnes or  in 
question no  by h
what other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing
mr alavanos i would like to say that i have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised
the council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts
it will not be tolerated and must stop immediately
i think that this is an extremely important point this sense of conditionality which underlies the european union s position is being maintained by the council and will continue to be maintained
i would like to thank mr presidentinoffice of the council
today s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed and one which i welcome
the united nation s and mr kouchner s mission in kosovo ended in failure
there is one thing however that we cannot deny and that is that mr kouchner s efforts to return kosovo s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive
therefore the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public
we have endeavoured to provide material help
we have tried to defend peace by taking military action
mr rubig as i said i understand your concerns very well
there are two fundamental questions in particular
we advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency
mr seixas da costa i totally agree with you
the problem is not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working namely resolution 
does the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo
question no  by h
however housing is specifically excluded
question no  by h
i thank the presidentinoffice for his reply
we also have to think of the consequences especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers
nevertheless as you know this issue is now in the hands of the european commission and it will have to take this further
the council s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited
mr president i too would like to welcome the presidentinoffice to the chamber
it should be pointed out that this can only be done within the council s scope for action
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development
i do not see how you could with the views that you hold provide any answers
i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters
i have spoken about the special european council and about portugal s initiative in convening it and i have spoken about the future because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion
the portuguese presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can in six months resolve problems that have always existed
it is prepared to act on proposals by the commission in any area for which there is community competence
we will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency
question no  by h
but there are some questions still outstanding
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aids in the programme
the situation of aids in africa now is so serious that more people are dying of aids than are dying in conflict
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue
medicines are available in the united states but the united states is not making them cheap enough for the people in africa
as you can understand it would be easy to do so
all we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme one after the other
we must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes
does the presidency intend to do anything about this
since the author is not present question no  lapses
i would like to thank the presidentinoffice of the council and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency
please allow me to remark on how wellversed and wellinformed he is on european affairs
unfortunately in my case he did not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer
these cultural dimensions however almost always have their own economic dimension in turn that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union and especially within the framework of the council
this is and will continue to be connected with developments within the world trade organisation
as you know both we and the council have addressed this issue appropriately
but mr marinos in the eu context culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with igc agendas
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this
we will soon see and for our part we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue
mr president i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency
well i and my fellow  british conservative meps wish it and would like you to please consider it
i appreciate that it is a provocative question
i cannot think of a better way to do it
can you
the issue is whether the european dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the treaties
intergovernmental conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree
mr dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion
i would ask him to be brief
mr president i understand that i have to do this very quickly
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas
in spain they say a letter to the three kings
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports
now the presidency and the council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings
as i suspected it was not exactly a procedural motion but more a closing of the debate
we thank mr seixas da costa but he can also write his letter to the three kings
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one
the problem is that in this case father christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so
it is not the portuguese presidency s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants especially those that the european parliament is asking for
after this interesting exchange of opinions and in accordance with the rules of procedure i would like to tell you that questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the council
capital tax
the next item is the joint debate on
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu
i am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the guengl greensefa eldr and pse groups
madam president i do not have a great deal to add on this subject
as it falls to the commission to propose any such initiative the council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue
madam president the revenue basis of the tobin tax is said to be made up of very shortterm exchange transactions
such transactions according to the argument bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables this has also just been underlined by mr desir
mr desir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides
in that case the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate
for the reasons set out above i cannot see a good reason for introducing a european tobin tax
at any rate the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union
also because i know how many social democrats in this house share our criticism and not just the economic and financial policy experts
we know what the problem is instability on the markets as the result of speculation
in my view and i say this quite clearly the question is ideologically motivated rather than solutionfocused
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable
first and the commissioner has also confirmed this because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets
secondly speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify
fourthly technically speaking this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today
we need stronger banking supervision
we need to clarify the liability for transactions
we need a framework of regulations at international level
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands
i refer to point 
madam president the debate on a tax on shortterm financial actions is not a new one
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on shortterm transactions really is
we must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice
i will have to repeat these arguments modestly in this intervention because the same issue has arisen once again
in itself globalisation is positive
the economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level
as i have said we are not opposed to such a study
in this respect mr bolkestein the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the tobin tax
secondly the motion does not say that we want a solely european initiative
there should be no confusion in this debate as environmentalists we do not want an excuse for a motion
although a study produced by the commission would doubtless be interesting we do not need another to add to those already available
this argument is therefore not relevant
i will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments
however i would highlight not only paragraph  of the motion but also paragraph 
usd   billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world s currency markets this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services
by putting finance at the helm this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere
unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing
the commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this
madam president i too am delighted that we are having this debate i only regret that it has been so long in coming
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate
there should therefore be a universal application it is not enough that the g countries or the other industrialised countries are involved
hence as mr karas has stated to his credit our group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the tobin tax
madam president i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders
it seems to me blindingly selfevident that some action is necessary
mr chirac has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators stockbrokers and option traders
europe japan and the us  the euro the yen and the dollar would constitute in my opinion such a block
i am disappointed in the epp
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on
yes i am in favour of such a tax but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind
the tax has the support of  of the people in the uk according to a recent survey by war on want
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament the council or the commission
there is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than it has not been done before
i have two or three points to make in this respect
the proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich european countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism
this is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from noneconomic activities increases more and more quickly
nor do i believe that this is impracticable
there must be an overriding economic interest
madam president we are not asking for more bureaucracy as mr karas put it just a few minutes ago
we are looking for solutions
of course capital markets need clarity  that is actually the idea
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question
we citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation
to continue would be economic suicide
speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are in turn generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious
overoptimism will give way to disappointment and fear which in turn will result in a stock market and economic crisis
the danger is too great for us to ignore
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem
that is what we are lacking commissioner the political will to make a start in tackling speculation
madam president mr bolkestein the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable
we needed a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax means
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it
we all know that
they are all tarred with the same dirty brush
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene
madam president i am totally appalled by the commission s ie mr bolkestein s political ignorance
he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all
madam president i too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre
those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested
we have asset inflation of global proportions
and it is precisely the mediumsized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result
we can take action against this it is possible
that too is feasible
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable  it is quite feasible in the age of the computer
madam president let us indeed tax money speculation it does not produce anything new
the tax would be targeted at the right place at the speculators
who is going to defend these speculators when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax
article  c of the treaty establishing the european union provides scope for taxation on transactions
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those taxrecycling centres the tax havens of which there are  in all
the union should make a tax pact which any countries could initially be party to
the low rate tobin tax would not cause taxrecycling problems
it is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect
the european union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries and you see how we are today
in the end tax would politicise the global undemocratic system of financial power
whatever one may think about the topic of debate it is evident that it is an important one
this is why it has been around for years and it is satisfying that the commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response
i would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the member of your parliament mr gasoliba
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon and i share his view
i think that he is correct in this regard
i too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks and that is why i am reiterating them here
surely we are all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market i am in other words opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners
i think that this will be problematic
madam president mr jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets
in order to remove these causes one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question
is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in english good governance 
is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates
that the markets for production factors including the labour market operate flexibly
that is not always the case
in addition  and this has also been mentioned already for example by mr gasoliba i bohm but also by others  there is a need for more supervision
more supervision nationally  supervision by national governments of national banks  and internationally for example by means of the imf
madam president according to various members of your parliament more funding should still be made available for major projects
for example mr kreissldorfler spoke in english about longterm capital for longterm projects  this is an obvious issue
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate
i have received four motions for a resolution tabled pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
madam president unfortunately i do not have your mastery of the french language
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him
monsieur bolkestein je veux vous dire quelque chose
unfortunately my dutch is not as good as yours
but i would rather like to say something else to you
parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a tobin type tax just to annoy the commission
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax
it will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this
it is not your job it is our job to decide on that
it also has something to do with the newly awoken selfconsciousness of this parliament
i just want to discuss it with you no more and no less
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously and that includes the tobin tax
mr desir i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution
if the services of the presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled it will be included
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  pm
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr president i simply wanted to pass on some news there was a terrorist attack this morning in madrid
someone planted a car bomb and one person has died
on behalf of my group i once again condemn these terrorist acts
thank you mrs fraga estevez
we had heard about this regrettable incident
the minutes were approved
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday  january 
madam president allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the cermis tragedy
mrs angelilli thank you i have taken note of your comment
agenda
the next item is the order of business
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal
madam president it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule  of our rules of procedure
this debate is topical exceptionally important and urgent
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it
applause
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal
if you ratify 
mr gollnisch excuse me you have one minute
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rules of procedure are observed
madam president i thought i had three minutes
do forgive me
we have heard one speaker in favour and one against
i shall now therefore put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote
parliament gave its assent
this debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
talks in austria on forming a government
the next item is the debate on the talks in austria on forming a government
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa presidentinoffice of the council
let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts
i will say one thing for many years i was a traitor to my country at least that was general franco s view
president guterres was also a traitor in salazar s eyes and that is something that i believe should also be stated and defended by the ppede
i also believe that the commission or president prodi has acted as a guardian of the treaties
however i would remind him that during his inaugural debate he described the commission as a european government
a government must have more nerve and more courage
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment
applause
secondly madam president we wish to send a very clear message to the austrian people
we should not be so politically partisan
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture
we all took part in it not just one group
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence
applause from the pse group
instead we have been forced to debate the formal substantial errors that have been made in the last few days
we have never before seen such serious clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a member state
however up till now austria has committed no serious or persistent violation
sanctions can be imposed after the treaties have been violated but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government
bilateral relations involve the states so the  do not come into this
however we already knew this
however today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the union seem to have turned their backs on the union s democratic role
we believe in europe while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union
this is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks
we have built a europe with an unstable market not a europe with principles rights and politics
and these are the consequences
madam president today we have an appointment with hypocrisy
in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria
we could if one third of the members of parliament so requested require that the council and the commission look into the matter
the president cut the speaker off
madame president my group the edd and especially my party are very concerned by this debate
are you going to interfere with great britain s parliament if we are elected
madame president the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament
i believe they gave him  of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government
then and only then might you consider if human rights are affected
austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it rightly or wrongly
this is the citizen of a state s prerogative for it is the founding principle of a democracy
when we suddenly refused this offer an inflammatory and rabblerousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day
the fpo party is established in austria s political landscape
the head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments
shame on you mr bertinotti
denouncing a democratically elected politician as a nazi does not make you an antifascist
on the contrary you are deriding the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did
that is why we are indebted to the commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest
the president cut the speaker off
austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition
our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present
the ovp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union
my country s place is not outside the european union but in it 
 with all the rights and commitments that this entails
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values
applause
not even mr sichrovsky s web of lies or mrs stenzel s words of appeasement can do anything to change that
applause heckling
they are trading this in for a head of government s position and for membership of a government
 and that includes their representatives in this parliament
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play ie that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system
applause
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured
that is how the wolf  albeit on account of the selfsacrifice of the ovp  is sustained rather than kept in check
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria
applause
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy or even against a relapse into barbarism
please support the austrian people against this government
applause
as members of parliament we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration
as important is the fact that austria s forces of democracy should be given support as none of us wishes to isolate the country
we know that most austrians respect these values
they have also shown how they feel not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy
i also appeal to the austrian president that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces
this danger does not concern austria it concerns europe
we are talking about us not austria
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation
europe is showing that it has not forgotten auschwitz europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past
this is the change we must impose on the commission s action
madam president we are debating an extremely serious issue
a simple reading of chapter  article  of the austrian freedom party s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder
however that is not the problem
our answer to this crucial question is no
we agree with its substance its tone and its scope
applause
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided
loud applause
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances
let us learn the lessons of the past
they put their own petty squabbles first and the rest is history
we must make a rapid strong and united response
so our response must be rapid and strong
of course the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable i was almost going to say irreparable 
and when that day comes it is too late
we must therefore find a political solution
our response must be rapid
if today we do not staunchly support the council then history will judge us saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the munich agreement
this debate and the background to it reinforced the point that the council the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists
this madam president is the hypocrisy of the left
we should recognise however that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results
this requires action to address the underlying causes including an examination of the electoral process itself
that should be our task not political posturing
secondly i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned
that is why we are reacting against this carryon in austria
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values something which we take seriously something has happened
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine
and this is not pure chance
this chamber was not made for goods it was not made for money
this chamber and the european institutions were build to uphold values morality and a certain spirit
well we cannot accept such statements
applause
madam president we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as fortunately are a great many other members too
the austrian freedom party leader mr haider has repeatedly repudiated these values
he also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness
he is a dangerous man
values should take precedence over power
we deplore therefore what is happening in austria
in fact we were shaken by it
we are extremely disappointed
as a last resort we would ask the ovp to look into alternatives
we keep reminding them about article  of the treaty
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right
madam president austria awaits a heavy responsibility
from all accounts this would only serve to strengthen haider
who would want this to happen
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics
europe is a community of law
democracy respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold
applause
there is no complacency no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague franz fischler
that surely is in everyone s interests
we will continue to do that madam president without fear or favour
that is our duty
it is also a matter of conviction
my final point is this
we understand the context of this essential debate
we understand that and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism
however the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning
does the commission support the council
thank you commissioner kinnock
thank you ladies and gentlemen
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed
the vote will take place at  am tomorrow
recourse to the precautionary principle
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle
the precautionary principle is not a new concept
it also appears in a range of international texts for example the rio declaration and most recently the biosafety protocol
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear
however the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years
the basic aim of the communication is twofold
it is therefore political by nature
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken
for example if one product has been approved similar products should also be approved
all these elements have to apply cumulatively
applying the precautionary principle does not therefore automatically imply a ban
mr president commissioner thank you very much for your statement
i have three short questions the first being as follows
i am sure that your answer to this will be yes but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be
lastly will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation
 thank you very much dagmar rothbehrendt for these questions
of course this is shared by the whole commission
yes i would say we already use this way of working with different difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example
and i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle
it has been mainly used in the environmental field but of course also when it comes to human health
so we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it
needless to say this accords science a great deal of power
we might ask ourselves what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for
i would like to ask what is then the definition of a recognised minority
how would you describe this
what establishes a recognised minority
if a political decision is involved i would also like to ask who takes this political decision
the commission
the council
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this
what is the role of the scientific committees
what also will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up
finally will this whole decisionmaking process be carried out in a transparent public way
these are my three questions
 yes mr president that is true
who will take the decision who are the decisionmakers
well that depends on who the legislators are
this is part of risk management
however it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete
that is of course where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science
you have to see this as a tool for risk management
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science
then you decide to take a measure or not to take action or not
mr president i have a question concerning an actual concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle
it is about brominated flame retardants
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment
 sv mr president thank you very much mr sjostedt for this question
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken
it ought not therefore to be immediately interpreted as a ban
this issue is extremely topical
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormonetreated beef and genetically modified crops
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do
 sv mr president i am pleased to be able to tell you that in montreal we have just signed a protocol concerning biosafety
we succeeded there in agreeing at an international forum as to the definition of the precautionary principle
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol
i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted
it is moreover also accepted as an important and effective tool
mr president i have two questions i shall try to be very brief indeed
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle
as i have understood it there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out including a costbenefit analysis
my second question concerns the burden of proof
i remember margot wallstrom being introduced as commissioner in the committee
at that time she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof
in other words a product s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now
 sv thank you mrs schorling
these are two important questions and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them
it is not therefore the case that one must begin with a costbenefit analysis
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this
i will give an example a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind it is therefore a teratogenic substance
very well it is a fungicide it kills off mould
this teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high there are no benefits that can compensate for this
in those circumstances consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result
at a hospice for aids patients i met two irish catholic nuns who were caring for dying aids patients
i believe we can learn something from this
mr president it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions
indeed you responded in kind as i knew you would do
i have good reason for asking this
as you rightly said the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where as yet there is no scientific evidence
i am certain that we are going to have more conflicts for example with the united states
we should not be so naive as to think otherwise
this constitutes a good example therefore
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
intergovernmental conference
let me also once more thank my corapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method based on which europe will be functioning in the twentieth century
i will not repeat which ones because everyone knows
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which for that very reason are highly visible to the european public
mr president the group of the european people s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki
the european council in helsinki itself approved enlargement involving  new member states
having said this mr president this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference
in theory we could have done so
we could have voted on the th of this month and the conference would not have been able to start on the th
mr president i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the european parliament itself
therefore the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase
it is already established within the community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with parliament
therefore since the qualified majority will be extended there will also be more codecision with parliament
however this parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational european institution if it did not consider the political design of the union
that it is what we are doing
we believe that in the political design of the union other issues need to be dealt with
we will talk about this on another day
the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term because they are very important subjects in themselves
let us call them the first three subjects of the igc
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc
they did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study
they need a political deal
in those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda
there are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at especially before such a large widening of the union to so many new countries
nobody is asking for a christmas tree
nobody is asking for an igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated
however there are six seven eight nine perhaps subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address
there is time
remember the igc that led to the single european act
it lasted only five months
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty lasted a year
i am pleased to see that the commission shares our view
i thank the commission for doing that even if of course i do not agree with everything the commission said
i think there are some gaps in what they have put forward
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this igc
that is all to the good
the parliament the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted
it is vital that the igc prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the treaty
one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court
another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention
my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform
how though is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now ie before enlargement takes place
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference
my group mr presidentinoffice of the council noted with satisfaction that the council presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs
the politics of closed doors and private discussions all that must be consigned to the past once and for all
that is why we need transparency
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to
after all what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals
no to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the union
the poor turnout at the european elections really should have been warning enough for everyone
of course we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a union of  plus member states
we need bold change and at the same time we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small states
this is something i would stress particularly with my being an mep for one of the major member states
there is one final issue i would like to raise
parliament s opinion expressly demands amendments to the treaty in the area of economic policy
what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union s policies to date
it is all about creating a socially just europe
it must be adhered to in the interests of the fast effective work of the conference prior to enlargement
our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which when taken together form a real alternative resolution
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decisionmaking system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty
the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint but this is a totally superficial concept
this is the message that parliament is sending to the council
this message must be very clear this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow
there is clearly a more ambitious goal
otherwise the challenge really would be lost not just for the present but also for many years to come
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day
brussels knows best
under the banner of progress towards transparency  a range of documents is being locked away from the general public
it is of course thoroughly orwellian
the president cut the speaker off
we as a european parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve
there is more to be said on that score
in the end it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens
at the same time of course we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the european union
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade
of course we also want to extend the european parliament s corresponding powers in this area
the finance ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting when in the ecofin council and in the euro  council which is an unacceptable way to go on
however there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side
the overall plan failed to do justice to any of this
we must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter perhaps to extend the mandate
there is another point i would just like to draw your attention to
the european union needs few if any new instruments and it does not need any new competences
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice
in my view that is the most important issue this intergovernmental conference has to concentrate its energies on
if we succeed in making progress here then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the european union
this is the crux of the matter
mr presidentinoffice of the council i am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage
the aim was not to draw conclusions  it was impossible to draw any  but the debate was certainly very encouraging
however we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference
yesterday we also discussed the commission represented by commissioner barnier who gave its opinion
mr president only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement
only a strengthened europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction
that is why sweeping reforms are necessary and hence a widened igc agenda
the finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and unfortunately turned a deaf ear to this parliament
portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor s book
it is of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join forces for this igc
in many ways they share the same interests and the same insights
of all priorities this one is the most pressing
what is the commission s verdict on this
not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new member states but we owe them to ourselves
if we allow europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement we will drown in our own political quagmire
mr president there are days when i really cannot understand this parliament it seems to take a masochistic pleasure in selfmutilation
a good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today
because of the situation in austria this is a dark day for europe
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing
the forthcoming enlargement of the union is used as an argument for this
i am convinced that this is an error of judgement
a federal and centralist eu which intervenes more and more in the government of the member states is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement
paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level
it is not however possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union
if there is a desire to make the eu more democratic the whole construction of emu must be reconsidered
in the majority of eu countries there are now governments dominated by social democrats
it also of course damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital
the resolution requires the european parliament to have increased influence over the intergovernmental conference
it is however important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference is and will remain a conference of the member states
it is the member states parliaments or people voting in referenda who are to direct the development of the treaty
it is therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification
this is what is and was meant by the call for a european constitution
however that is precisely what is happening
i welcome commissioner barnier and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon
on  february we will see the launch of the igc which is to be completed by the end of 
this is a big task but it can be done
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important amsterdam leftovers 
i feel i speak for many smaller countries when i make that particular point
so we are watching that entire point extremely carefully
we look forward to the charter of fundamental rights and to seeing its contents
in any case this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon
i think that under the present rules of the treaties the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation
we must use dialogue at every political level including of course dialogue with the national parliaments
that way we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms
the issues to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference are exceptionally sensitive
i will mention two point that may create tension
one is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries
europe is not nor can it become a classic federal state
the other area of conflict is more difficult
this means that they must function more simply and more rapidly
by its very nature however the european union is and will remain a complex and convoluted multigovernmental institution
possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist
of course they do but they are not unlimited
if the limits are exceeded because of a onesided quest for effectiveness then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer
i am however optimistic
mr president the intergovernmental conference mandate needs to be widened
the most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the union
the commission s former president jacques delors has once again publicly raised the issue of a european confederation
the commission s current president mr prodi and the high representative mr solana have put forward ideas along the same lines
in the next resolution on the igc parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament
a ceiling of  has been prescribed as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly
what will happen to a place like scotland which i represent here
it will become totally invisible
a growing body of opinion in scotland holds that view
mr president to say that the european union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new it has been said many times
this time however it is true
we have established the single currency  which is extremely positive  and we are facing enlargement
the question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not
will we enlarge with or without deep reform
it is clear that the council for the moment has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place
that puts enlargement in danger it jeopardises any prospect of political union and of course it is difficult for the public to understand
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion
we want an intergovernmental conference but not this one
must there be an igc
of course there must but not this type of intergovernmental conference
we must clearly set firm objectives
the functionalist approach is over for better or for worse
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point
have we achieved results
we know i know myself that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us
i would just like to make a few comments after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups
we have not restricted ourselves to the three socalled leftovers which is in any case an incorrect label
they are the first but they are not the only subjects mr seguro that the conference must deal with
however these council proceedings must be carefully prepared
finally i should like to make three additional comments quite briefly mr president
such dialogue between the national parliaments the european parliament and ourselves is extremely important
i have said furthermore that i would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments
tomorrow i shall be in london
in a fortnight s time i shall be in berlin
in three weeks time i shall be in paris and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive and i should like to thank you for taking it
my second brief comment is to thank the portuguese presidency particularly mr seixas da costa for his proactive approach
it will have to initiate these negotiations
not only that a conclusion can be reached but that a successful conclusion can be reached which is not necessarily the same thing
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully
it is all the work which is going to be carried out together under your guidance particularly in the course of these few months which is extremely important
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few months
finally let me repeat we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations
these are difficult subjects subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain
as far as the commission is concerned it will ladies and gentlemen be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate
crossborder services
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises
it is not about establishing original rights for thirdcountry nationals modelled on freedom of movement
all provisions ie issues relating to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence rights should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services
consequently i do not see that there is any real obstacle to the council s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned
i am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms
i believe this system is also more suited to practical needs
however we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be  months
i would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
of course i would add that i continue to support this committee s amendments which they adopted unanimously
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report
this would make our rapporteur s life considerably easier in the future
there is also a proposed amendment to both of mrs de palacio s reports
that is why he deserves special mention

the commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card
however i do not consider a threemonth period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a member state
that does not prevent these member states from taking publicorder measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification
neither does the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three months after the card has expired
following completion of the service it is not acceptable for the thirdcountry subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service is provided
that is why the commission supports mrs palacio s amendment no  in both respects
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments
i propose to confine my comments to two areas
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve that is achieve in the real sense
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account
my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card
neither outcome would be satisfactory
perhaps this is also why as is rumoured to be the case the council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well
therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more member states
accordingly the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance
consequently i too have to say that i am in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the commission
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers
we all know that there are still various parts of the treaty some of them very old which are still referred to as ec
we are aware that this directive is founded on ec law and not on eu law
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu
they have now got to grips with eu 
it is the world of the eu that the citizens are interested in this is the one that counts in their eyes
i would urge the council and the commission to move in this direction
this directive is of course not in itself directly about that
that is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger
nevertheless i have tabled an amendment
mrs berger in your amendment no  to recital  you mention legal security
the first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit since all that does is create legal insecurity
if the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date it must end on that date
legal security requires this
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article  of the directive
it therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity
i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result
however in the case of the united kingdom we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable
partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the united kingdom
under the arrangements contained in the treaties the united kingdom retains its border controls
for that reason we shall vote against both these proposals
why do i think we need the directive so much
there are approximately thirteen million thirdcountry subjects who reside within european territory
so up to now their access to the entire territory of the union has not been regulated by community legislation
i have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the commissioner
i think that with this report we are once again one step closer to the realisation of the internal market
mr president thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail
in the course of my speech i would also like to address lord inglewood regarding the remark he has just made
amendments nos  and  are acceptable too provided the situation of posting is established in the member state in which the service provider is established
in terms of comitology amendments nos  and  also apply in part insofar as the rights of parliament are concerned
in this respect the commission supports amendment no  as i have already mentioned
the other amendments are unacceptable
as amendment no  refers to directive  concerning the minimum wage which is already in force no change is necessary
surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the member states
amendment no  is also unacceptable given my thoughts on amendment no 
the commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal
i would like to add that amendment no  to that proposal is wholly acceptable
i would now like to move on to lord inglewood s remark
the question is furthermore one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way
in my opinion this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the european union and perhaps not to the present debate
i will keep myself free in this connection
thank you very much commissioner bolkestein
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
court of first instance
for this reason i would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by vicepresident marinho
behind these principles mr president lies the justice system
however justice delayed is justice denied and we must reflect on this notion
the working document prepared by the court itself contains alarming information
for this reason the draft reform which has been drawn up by the rapporteur vicepresident marinho is to be welcomed
we have to offer solutions which while provisional help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice
the first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance and that they should be given one more referendaire
the second is that the translation services of the court of first instance and the court of justice should be separated
at the moment the court of first instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated
since we are talking about the intergovernmental conference let us consider just two points
the first concerns this parliament
and i refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days
mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report
it has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency
both concern cases with decisions pending before the court of justice
the decision could have huge implications for our local economy
these are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in europe s system of justice delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy
amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references
in the face of coming enlargement the igc must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system
mr president i too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here
we need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind
on a final note i too believe that olaf requires monitoring under rule of law
as things stand olaf is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases
it is essential for olaf to be monitored by a court
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the court of first instance
that would be another way of spurring the reform process on
mr president i would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work
the european union is a system based on law
it must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem
however as mr marinho has pointed out more is necessary but that has to wait for the igc
certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible
i would be grateful if the commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this
mr president on behalf of commission president mr prodi i would like to respond as follows
the unease is justified
it has been said more than once justice delayed is justice denied
the commission sympathises with these considerations
in the light of this sympathy i would like to continue my response as follows
in other words once this study is complete the commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am tomorrow
exceptional financial aid to kosovo
i have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes
i propose that we start the debate immediately
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrives
i therefore give the floor immediately to mr bourlanges in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budgets
an urgent request has been referred to us and we approve it
we have been asked for eur  million
we are talking about macrofinancial aid
this is not our opinion
the second important problem is that we have been asked for payments the donors have made commitments and obviously we are the only ones actually paying
the other parties are not paying
we wish to see an end to this onesided situation regarding requests for financial aid
we would like the commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this
we would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors
when we come to pay we want to know what the others are paying
secondly we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation
this is serious since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in kosovo
we have commission documents which speak of firm commitments
kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment
no one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result
no one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have visavis unmik
of all people it is the albanians who are now being integrated into the transitional council who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them
i would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about
administrationwise there are now  tax inspectors
that is excellent news
another positive development i would like to remind you of is the fact that the old uck is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country
i believe that is a good thing
the eu commission cannot pay for everything
mr president i would like to offer a few explanations
in a debate there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said
however i would like to concentrate on two points
i would like to point out to mrs albright that what we have read recently in the press is true and that figures do not lie
let us make this clear however much some people may not wish to believe it
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach
the things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there
however this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process
only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions
i urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this
however we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here
in other words we should ensure that the money falls to mr kouchner s sphere of competence and not to other spheres
it is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe in the interests of the persons affected
we have so many coordinators who in turn are responsible to so many employers that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators
if the alliance is still active in that region it is with the same objective
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen firstly i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur mr brok for his report
if the council had worked as quickly as mr brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on
the council s failings in this respect are a source of much regret
what is to be done with this money
i would like to highlight the issue of human rights
the west fought for human rights in kosovo and what is happening there today
every single day there are attacks on serbs on the roma on bosnians but attacks are also still carried out on albanians
these are events and situations that cannot be tolerated
there are at the very least rumours that serbian militias are up to their old tricks again
it is irrelevant as far as i am concerned as to whether it is serbs roma bosnians or albanians who are threatened or killed in kosovo
it is also irrelevant in my view as to who is working towards separation and division in kosovo
we need more police officers as we have nowhere near enough
all of this needs to happen and quickly too
that is why i believe that we were right to take action quickly to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available
i think i have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight s debate
however in moving forward what should we be financing
this is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement
we believe that to prejudge at the moment where resources should be directed would create more practical difficulties
in short we should put our faith in those parties who in these areas are better equipped than us to make certain decisions
is the commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate
some of the amendments in your report pose this question
for example amendments nos   and 
i would say the same about amendment no  which we would also accept with a slight modification since the idea seems to us to be basically correct
amendment no  is of a similar nature
on this specific point we can perhaps offer mr bourlanges greater satisfaction
we have already spoken to the council so that it might include a commission statement in its decision establishing this element of conditionality
a third problem has been raised by mrs duhrkop with regard to the multiannual programmes
i would remind you that these projects are multiannual
the programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account
lastly i would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us
the commission can commit itself to regularly informing parliament of the invitations to tender which are published
we also wish to see these publicised on the internet so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point
but if i understand what mr solbes mira says correctly then this undertaking was only a tentative one
commissioner an agreement is an agreement
no mr bourlanges i think it is a substantive problem
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted
with this we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed
i am simply asking the commission to come and inform the committee on budgets before implementing the second tranche
i agree absolutely we shall do so
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am tomorrow
altener
the project has been long and problematic
in future too there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources
although there is much that is good about the new directive it is nonetheless not without its defects
one example is the use of peat
peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels
it is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as for example coal
the development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the union s dependence on imported energy
research is particularly essential with regard also to the eu s next round of enlargement
the eu must adhere to the kyoto protocol on climate
we are all concerned about the environment and our children s future
for that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate nuclear energy
firstly however i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur mr langen for the truly excellent work he has done on this report
i would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the conciliation committee mr provan
for as mr langen said just now we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the conciliation committee
however we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the european parliament throughout
this is not satisfactory  i would like to make that quite clear
however we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed
this is the european union s declared aim
it contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors
it is very important for this altener programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it
the overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately eur  billion
 of this is to come from private sources and this will be supplemented by public funds from the member states and from the regions
mr president commissioner i would like to thank mr langen for his excellent work in this important matter
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy
there is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets however
the main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the member states
promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment
the union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up
renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment
may i also venture to raise the matter of peat
peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources
however it is important at least in finland as a sustainably used slowly renewable energy source
i hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables
this is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale
mr president may i commence by complimenting mr langen on his work
the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone
in this regard it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit
it is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables
i would hope that the contribution of altener would lead to more initiatives
as the final text rightly states actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities
altener will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the member states
an initial conciliation meeting was not successful because the council would not at that time accept an increase of eur  million
we could not agree with a proposal like this which challenged the authority of the european parliament
a second round of conciliation achieved an increase of eur  million in order to reach this compromise figure of  million
in fact renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives
i would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the council
save
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress
the issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by parliament in the face of the council s very meagre opening offer
in the event we had to have several meetings before the council finally increased this to a substantial amount
this was an important consideration for us
funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the member states
we have to bear that in mind when approving this programme
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard
save is the only communitywide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy
here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings
it is something that we can all support
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do
i would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am tomorrow
culture 
unfortunately there has been no change in the way that the council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it
for no one is very keen to spend money on culture
sadly that is the case and we must face facts
i would like to thank the rapporteur who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task in conjunction with the commissioner of course
one seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision
what kind of horsetrading system is this
it is downright scandalous what goes on
it is an awful sort of horsetrading based on unequal positions
nevertheless we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us
it is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money
on the other hand it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this parliament which were minimal anyway
incidentally this last point would be unfair to fourteen members of the council since it was just one the netherlands which was responsible for that intransigence
it has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the council
this demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution
congratulations
it is also of great importance to citizens
today we have arrived at the end of a long road
i would nonetheless like as others have done to touch upon the procedure which is unclear and above all unwanted
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand
they are like a snake biting its own tail
the result is  growth so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result
i would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot
culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas
fortunately i am on the committee on regional policy
so i myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention
i have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect
this is especially important to smaller linguistic areas i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also mrs reding for culture 
all that remains for me to say is time to get down to business
i too must say that i will be voting for this joint text for a council and european parliament decision with a very heavy heart
it is shameful
that figure of eur  million for so many years is a disgrace for the european union


we hope that this at the least will come about during the evaluation process
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social as well as economic development of a people
both of them have done a firstclass job
why do i say that culture is important
well in simple economic terms europe s culture adds to genuine prosperity
where would europe s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture
but more importantly than that cultural activities are what make mankind civilised
culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy
cultural diversity is important and it is under threat
however it is not under threat from europe
that is what culture  is about
so i say to the council of ministers keep this programme genuinely under review
are we doing enough
the framework programme on culture is replacing the present kaleidoscope ariane and raphael programmes
we need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial
literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues
cultural activity creates identity
cultural activity is an expression of individuality of an individual s own personality it builds relationships and communicates
we want a colourful europe
we want a europe based on the principle of diversity within unity
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences
i would like to second what the previous speaker had to say
in this way the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order
the council could not be moved not even when the precursor programmes kaleidoscope ariane and raphael finished
a pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap
this showed up the weaknesses of the european union s cultural policy activities once again
the political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support
out of  applications in  only  projects with a low overall volume of eur  million could be considered
the council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate parliament to the tune of even a single euro
and so the moderate sum of  million will stand until 
there is a blatant discrepancy here
and so we are going to have to be content albeit very grudgingly with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content
previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out
we can only hope that it will after all be possible to persuade the council to have a change of heart one day
perhaps the council will come to understand that cultural activities do the european union good not harm
cultural cooperation  and this was also mentioned earlier  truly creates identity far more so than any transport directive however important it might be
providing support for culture meets with widespread acceptance and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions
what may i ask is the council afraid of
i shall simply stress my own personal complaint because in the end we did not manage to adopt a review clause
man and culture are priorities and culture can result in economic growth
let us contemplate this result derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy
the fundamental question it seems to me that faces this parliament the commission and the council is what is europe
what does it mean and what does europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries
that is what culture  represents
it promotes mobility and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded
madam president ladies and gentlemen we have now come to the end of a long road
following the conciliation stage our institutions can now formally adopt the new culture  framework programme
it is with great satisfaction that i today welcome this happy ending in this house and i thank you for it
i wish to thank everyone in this parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process
they all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution
if need be the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision and this should be achieved by  june 
ladies and gentlemen this is a formal commitment not just words on paper
this is going to lead us to make culture  the programme of the citizen
this is what our european culture  programme offers
it does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various member states
such policies are necessary and i would like to see them developed further
it simply adds to them complements them building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries
a number of members of parliament have quite rightly raised this point if the union is purely an economic union then it is a stillborn project
however if it is a union of culture civilisation and participation then it becomes a living thing
secondly encouraging exchanges mobility and training in the cultural sector
thirdly promoting cooperation between cultural operators
thank you commissioner
i think we can also thank the rapporteur once again
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am tomorrow
the sitting was closed at  pm
endoflife vehicles
mr president nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in europe
we therefore have a number of amendments
i personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective
i do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive
i am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to specialpurpose vehicles either
i want specialpurpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas
this is my main concern in this matter
in my opinion the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in europe
this can be left as the commission has proposed with the member states ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars
an important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts
what should we do with the shredded products
quotas are not therefore the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility just one of many
of course we need to aim high but quotas must not become an end in themselves
this would at least mean  kg times  km less transportation
we think they should
may i say something about costs
some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer
i can only warn you against consenting to this
there are amendments which propose splitting the costs fiftyfifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car
this too is a particular desire of my group
the car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly
this is why i propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer
as for a ban on certain materials of course we need one
a car has dangerous components which we must ban longterm
this means that we need a pressure instrument
the commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives
there are a number of sound amendments
this parliament has been given more authority so let us use it
let us have the courage to put together a groundbreaking directive
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this house
i ask for your support
the principle of polluter pays is not being applied
the only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future
once again the principle of polluter pays is not being applied the taxpayer is still footing the bill
neither is correct
we simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive
all the same there is one point on which we are in conflict
in the grand scheme of the directive it is perhaps a minor point but nevertheless a disputed one
it concerns the issue of recycling costs
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of
and what about vehicles which are already on the road
mr president commissioner i think we need this directive
firstly because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives
secondly because it can promote recycling which is important
thirdly because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals
this is also an important point
secondly we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position
as from  therefore all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners
needless to say this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way
is this too much of a burden
there is however one thing we should not overlook
the directive applies to complete cars that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing
according to the experts few of these complete cars are of no value
after all recycling and the reuse of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily lossmaking
this directive encourages the whole of this sector
it is a sector which comprises small and mediumsized businesses
i think therefore that vintage cars ought to be exempt
also it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer
that is a basic principle which we must uphold
as manufacturers are responsible for the design they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase
i find this a wellbalanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things
i think we need to retain it
i would ask you to support this common position
mr president we need to take an important decision today
no according to the christian democrats in amendment no  car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 
it is evident from the packaging directive in which this  compromise is included that this does not work
packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in europe and is a burden upon the environment
the common position stipulates 
according to the group of the greens this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations
i would therefore urge my colleagues not to support amendment no  of the christian democrats and amendment no  of some of the socialists
the problem of plastic and pvc will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plantbased bioplastic
this is ultimately cheaper also for the consumer
for twenty years the majority within parliament has attempted to make european environmental policy greener
today this green position is being threatened under pressure from in particular the german and french car industries
that is why i urge you to vote against amendments nos  and 
we the green group by and large support the common position
if they were adopted many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive
for ourselves it is crucial that the following principles should apply
the polluter should pay
this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility financial as well as otherwise for recycling vehicles
there must be rules governing existing vehicles too
where this aspect is concerned we cannot accept any weakening of the council s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force
we shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations
i was myself a car worker before i was elected
i believe i am one of the few members of this parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars
i think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry
these would of course be to the advantage of modern progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms
it is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the european union
there is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment
our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests
mr president the directive on endoflife vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in europe
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter
to that extent it might be thought desirable even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity
the key questions now are who pays the eur  per car for the  million cars that are disposed of each year
who pays for the collection the dismantling the disposal and so on
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made
the proposal from the council the common position is that manufacturers should pay the lot
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union
that cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars
retrospective law is bad law it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law
that is why i have called for a rollcall vote on this
these amendments actually have the advantage  and i should like to stress this  of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives
but as mr lange so rightly said this solution is totally unfair to european car manufacturers
the common position puts european car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the european market
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must of course be exempt from the scope of this directive
cars are also part of our cultural heritage i think we would all agree on that
having said that one of the stumbling blocks concerns article  ie the date on which the directive will come into force
the european car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling
the common position was more feasible since it envisaged  for vehicles already on the road
this would furthermore make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses
mr president the european parliament is today facing an important decision
the credibility of parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake
the intention of florenz and lange in their amendments is obvious to sabotage the directive
the proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation
this is totally unacceptable
i therefore appeal to the german delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today
the redgreen federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the endoflife vehicles directive
do not continue in this vein
start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry
mr president this directive has been under discussion since 
it is high time that we reached an agreement
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context
the other question is who should bear the cost
we are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading
i believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines
mr president today the european parliament must face up to real responsibilities
we have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year
i can gauge its importance for my country s international reputation
i am aware of the difficulties the council experienced in finding a compromise
that is why today we must be understanding alchemists concerned for our environment
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not
as far as i am concerned at least the principle of polluter pays must be applied
the car industry increasingly more respectful of the environment has i am sure anticipated this kind of increasing awareness
indeed it is accepting its responsibilities
i am opposed to making the car owners liable
how furthermore can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within europe
who is to pay for recycling the car i bought in france if i register it in belgium
which national fund will pay for my endoflife vehicle
let us beware too of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application
now a sound common position submitted by the council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in parliament
every year we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances
this is why it is important to prevent waste materials
we should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals as well as of other dangerous substances and materials
what is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately
i therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for reuse and recycling which have been proposed by the council
these days the complete dismantling of endoflife vehicles is economically viable
this means that we move away from shredding
the prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and in the netherlands a value of  recycling has now already been achieved
the processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars
the proposals made by a few meps impact greatly on this system
the socalled shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation
if the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably
finally this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay at the expense of the environment
why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled if we are then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved
mr president i hold mr florenz in high esteem
he has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry
i would like to comment on two things firstly vintage cars and motorbikes
i do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way
the manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder andor owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost
in my opinion there is too much initial hesitation
the car lobby has led too many people up the garden path
these costs are not very high
in the member state where i come from you are talking about  guilders per car
if you charge this from day one you can process the old cars straight away
i do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise
i think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible
if we do reduce it we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste
if these amendments are adopted i think that we shall cause parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result
now who should pay the costs
whatever system is adopted ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer
the manufacturers have tricked mr florenz and mr lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals
do not be fooled by the car manufacturers
if you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments
mr president commissioner this debate is not a technical debate contrary to what we may think
it has become eminently political
yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate
today if  members of parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers we should be doing ourselves dishonour
we cannot accept this
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas
mr president like so many others here today i believe this is a good measure
this is a useful measure and it is one which we all need
most of the technical issues have been resolved
there are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved
we have arrived at the final question
they have paid already
i cannot accept that
there are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case
i cannot accept it and i will not vote for it
the responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer
it is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal
the common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government
the common position is a reasonable compromise
i cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of europe i am voting against those amendments
it is disgraceful the way in which the german presidency handled this matter
mind you even the resolution of the finnish council presidency in june was not the best result that could have been done achieved
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector
the common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint
consequently we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation
that is why in my opinion the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility
mr president there are two issues of principle in the council s draft directive
the first concerns the manufacturer s unrestricted liability to take back endoflife vehicles
there is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade
i believe that quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned the eu s directives should not treat small companies within the union unfairly
yet the trade in used car parts is important especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy
it should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up
they should be able to establish themselves in new markets but also to leave old markets
the second principle in the council s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive
it conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product
to do so also changes the owner s liability retroactively
over the years a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways
every country within the eu now has rules governing the scrapping of cars
some may be better than others and some worse
this does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds
mr president this is an extremely bad directive
first of all as my colleague mr bowis has pointed out it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle
it is far too prescriptive
it sets in stone one particular model of recycling
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach
the socialdemocratic group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days
consequently consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production
for the cars currently on the road it would be reasonable to share the cost for example by setting up a fund such as that in the netherlands
this is a big problem in my opinion
they would then determine their own prices
anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic
the european consumer organisation which has asked us to support the common position on this point is to my mind letting the consumer down
a second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers clutches is the cost of transport
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies this will necessitate transporting endoflife vehicles over long distances
i would therefore appreciate your support for amendment no 
mr president commissioner i have asked to speak again so that i can say a few more words at the close of this debate
if you travel to the netherlands you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car costfree
this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes
should this be condemned ecologically frau breyer
i do not think so
applause from the pse group
i will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems
we have reached an agreement with all the parties involved
an environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis
the car industry  and belgium produces a great many cars did not have any problem with that
belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost
i am in favour of collection free of charge
it worked for us
why would it not work elsewhere
mr president ladies and gentlemen thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes
allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive
allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate
first of all i think i should repeat some of the basic facts which mr florenz and others have already mentioned
moreover they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind
this is something you already know but i would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening
cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in europe
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it and there is no excuse for not taking action
secondly we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable
we should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product
thirdly we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive
these are the three most important aims of the directive
it is above all the manufacturer s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car s lifecycle
two important questions have arisen in this regard yes there are in fact more than two questions but i want to mention just two of the most important
first of all who should pay
and secondly are we reducing the european car industry s competitiveness by means of the present proposal
the first question then is about who should pay
it is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers
we have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car
do we imagine then that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive
no clearly we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment but it will be very much greater
moreover the cost will have to be borne in the future
the cost will not therefore disappear but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed
are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis
is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it
is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these
is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the european car industry
no of course not
it is quite the opposite
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuelefficient cars is going to decline in the future
what kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars
it is of course only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry
the cost is not insurmountable nor is the task an impossible one
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems
the industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in europe
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the european car industry
we must do this for the sake of the environment
the costs will not disappear nor will the waste disappear
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction
i also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation
clearly we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars
it is still not an insurmountable problem
we can deal with it
we already have an infrastructure
we have what we require in order to deal with endoflife cars
i naturally hope that the result of today s vote will be a good one
in fact it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to reuse and manufacturer s liability
i believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment
we cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters
as i have said we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues
after the first reading in the european parliament in  the commission s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the council
however we obtained a wellbalanced common position in july during the finnish presidency
now we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully
a total of  amendments have been tabled
the commission can adopt  amendments in their entirety
three amendments can be partially approved and one can be approved in principle
this applies to amendment no  excluding section   and  section   and  section       and 
these amendments can all be approved
amendments nos  and  are new the commission can approve these
the commission can also approve amendment no  with certain editorial changes
they cannot therefore be approved
parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in europe
it would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today
i am very concerned about certain amendments from parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question
these concern for example the phasingout of heavy metals manufacturer s liability and the requirement for recycling
i want to deal with these amendments on a groupbygroup basis
amendments nos          and  concern the phasingout of heavy metals
amendment no  involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force
amendments nos      and  involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions
this would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly
amendments nos   and  mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling
the commission considers that the type of phasingout proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view
amendments nos        and  relate to the manufacturer s liability
the compromise reached by the council is fair but fragile
the commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without at the same time creating tensions
this does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers far from it
amendments nos    and  concern quantified objectives
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year  were removed
these amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise
such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive
so whatever has been stated in this regard vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive
we do not consider that amendments nos  and  add anything to the directive
amendment no  involves the commission s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components
this is not covered by the directive
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the european parliament and the council
amendments nos   and  water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles
there is a danger of amendments nos  and  reducing the chances of recycling plastic tyres and glass
furthermore amendment no  does not fall within the directive s area of applicability
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
vote
there is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on amendment no 
in the english version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations
in the french version that becomes entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques 
could you please make sure that frenchspeaking members of this house know that the word entreprises is not correct
it should not be in the amendment
and again i urge you madam president to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently
madame mcnally in general i am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations
i shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution

this is why i would ask you to consider the english version as the original version
thank you mr van velzen
in response i shall say the same thing i said to mrs mcnally just now
in any case the authoritative version is always of course the original language version
madam president the socialist group proposes the following oral amendment
i shall read it in english which is the original language of the resolution
more than twelve members of parliament rise to their feet parliament adopted the resolution
explanations of vote
mcnally report a
 fr i am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the commission entitled women and science 
in this document the commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in europe
this objective deserves our total support
the various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various member states
relatively few women however are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies
it is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented
i am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the european commission
improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles
we will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy
in its communication women and science  the european commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in europe
this is very good and we are pleased to see it
the fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the european union
this is patently not the case since such a quota would not be realistic
indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved
it is not a quota
people must realise this
second reading of the florenz report a
here in my opinion the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies
this cannot be a good thing in a european union where we are ever mindful of employment
i consider that this is a serious defect and that in principle it does not befit our legal system
in my opinion this directive is unacceptable for this reason
madam president i would like to comment on the florenz report
here unfortunately the european parliament has bowed to the interests of industry
these splendid cars do not constitute waste
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments
neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country s statutes to another s
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations
we cannot forget old car enthusiasts either of whom there are more than   in finland alone
they are involved in lowprofile work of valuable cultural importance
 sv the parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing to say the least
before the vote at the plenary sitting new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee
in the divided situation which has now arisen we therefore consider that the council s wordings are the best
we need a directive in this area and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure
the directive concerning endoflife vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation
it is therefore important that the manufacturer s liability should be clear this should not in any way be jeopardised
there are however two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text
first of all who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person ie the vehicle owner who pays
he or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle which is a bottomless pit in financial terms
we have recently had cause to talk about the polluter pays principle we should apply this principle rationally and calmly correctly targeted and without ideology
so let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry
i only need to mention the case of directives  and 
the precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis
on the contrary we must adopt crystalclear texts in order to limit legal disputes

they made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety for example are nonsense
the car lobby was unsuccessful today and i am pleased about that
the directive remains in place
 my party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments
there are few things more certain in life than taxes death and pollution
in fact this directive like so many others addressing environmental issues is not good
the one thing it will not do is solve the problem  it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut
of course these are areas where the eu does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction
however in the absence of these powers it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure
berger report a
until now the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the union of noncommunity workers have been very harsh
it is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the european union is being made easier even when they are nationals of third countries
berger report a and berger report a
according to the terms of the directive the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned
the second proposal grants the same rights to selfemployed workers who are third country nationals
while basically i subscribe to the european commission proposals nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion
that is why i am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur
this will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions
this goes against the fundamental principle of nondiscrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this union
marinho report a
we have serious reservations about the council s proposed amendments
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter
some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them
on  january  the council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in article  of the accession treaty of  june 
so what was done at amsterdam
we cannot agree to this since such a sidelong shift towards a europe of the judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our states
this question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity
is the forthcoming intergovernmental conference not the ideal opportunity for this
dimitrakopoulos and leinen report a
we therefore of course support the european parliament s now giving the formal goahead to the intergovernmental conference
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place
we also argued this in november  and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of  november 

if they yield they are lost
for it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one
 da the danish social democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the intergovernmental conference
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process
that is something we do not want to see and we have therefore voted against any such extension

sv we are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the intergovernmental conference at the helsinki conference
possible future member states ought to be involved in and have an influence upon the shaping of the eu of the future
with the convening of the forthcoming igc the process of european union is topical once again
once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the heads of state and government
in other words fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide behind closed doors on the fate of more than  million individuals
it is therefore easy to understand the public s lack of interest given the construction of europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them
in fact one only need look at the agenda of the igc the institutions enlargement and european defence
social europe used as a foil by the eu has simply been eliminated from the agenda
this is why i am voting against the report
as the present crisis involving austria has demonstrated the union has the right to protect itself
we feel that these issues result from the igc s appropriateness and its objectives as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there
these are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us
 the european parliamentary labour party has abstained on the final vote on the leinen dimitrakopoulos report
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of destabilisation
our priorities ie the leftovers  must be
the number and responsibilities of commissioners
weighting of votes in the council
beyond this we have concerns that the flexibility or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states
i therefore of course support the european parliament s now giving the formal goahead to the intergovernmental conference
i nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place
i also refer to my explanation of vote of  november  which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence
joint resolution on austria
although comparing haider to hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some ppede members of parliament
is this hysteria spontaneous
is it the product of mere foolishness or more probably of a deliberate strategy which is the same throughout the world
who is imposing their will on the nations of europe daring to stop them choosing their own fate
underground networks
the government of the united states or of israel
or their socialist backup troops who in this house have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats
what are the values of the french socialist party which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the urba sages and graco scandals
i shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the italian socialist party because it does not do to kick a man when he is down still less when he is dead and gone
the president cut the speaker off
madam president i had a major problem with this resolution
finally i abstained on the vote for a number of reasons
however i do wonder about the wisdom of this
at the moment it seems that the haider party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments
even america has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations
we wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it
i really think that people should be extremely cautious
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism and i believe that we should we need to look at the root causes
we need to look at the people who vote for these parties and understand why this situation arises
madam president i strongly refute any statement demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism
i passionately defend europe s heritage of human rights and the rule of law
this is not the way to fight extremism
it may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good
what are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an intergovernmental conference
a europe of  states or a europe of  or even fewer
this needs to be said
some have said it is not right for us to interfere in austrian politics
they are wrong
european union treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections
however democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy
however we should not condemn mr haider for ambition
leopards do not change their spots
these are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us
i am proud to support such a resolution
i shall take the floor very briefly madam president
i do not believe that these signals will change the citizens indifference to europe
the austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present
they will not weaken mr haider and the fpo on the contrary they will strengthen them
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want
that is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right
 el the freedom party s participation in the austrian government is a dangerous development for the european union s political future
it is a trojan horse which is unfortunately reappearing in europe larger than ever since the second world war

this week we heard the first political cry of the newborn europe
it is a part of its future which is at stake right now part of its very essence its heart and soul
the european parliament was the first to speak up
this courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of europe
europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events
from now on europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition
fascism and neonazism are cancers
the foul monster has been reawakened
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might
europe was born out of a desire for peace freedom and tolerance
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic racist and antisemitic ministers to be tolerated at within it
do not count on me to keep quiet without doing or saying anything
such a concern is misplaced
the european parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in member states with which they disagree
we have condemned basque and irish terrorism
we have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities
by commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in austria from forming a coalition government
others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement
such a view is not only a political copout it is positively dangerous
that is why the european union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in austria
we have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that jorg haider stands for
we are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the  member states have employed on this issue
today as previously in the history of europe rightwing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life
the policy of cutbacks which has followed in the wake of adjusting to emu has promoted the successes of rightwing extremism
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in europe
 de i am making this statement on behalf of the csu
it is intolerable that the eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a member state
it has no right to do so
this does not mean that we sympathise with haider
the csu european delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the fpo
we must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results
for these reasons the csu european delegates are against this resolution
in this light the events we are seeing in austria must be seen as tragic
for all these reasons i voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this house on the formation of the government in austria
the resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of fascism
however i fear that a purely emotional reaction by europe to the events in austria will only multiply haider s adherents
the eu must not do him an invaluable pr service
this is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which i cannot condone
we german christian democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them
we revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic xenophobic and antiminority
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments
the german approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again
it cannot be copied arbitrarily since each member state has its own specific conditions
it can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles
the council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government
this condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the austrian republic
sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye
we must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left
in the meantime they have been forming governments in german federal states
i fully support the statements made by commissioner prodi in today s session
 fr i voted against the joint resolution on the situation in austria
austria is a free independent and sovereign country
the austrian elections were held in a free proper and democratic manner
any interference by the european institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable it is in violation of the european treaty article  of the treaty of amsterdam
nothing of this nature has yet occurred in austria
this precedent created on the initiative of the portuguese presidency is a worrying one as far as the future of the european union is concerned
in such circumstances will it even be worth having elections
i believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated
i urge the council and the council presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the union
i urge the commission to be less cautious
in this resolution parliament is assuming its responsibilities
having said that in my opinion the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum the very least we could do
personally i argued in favour of a rather harder line and i supported amendments nos     and  as well as the oral amendment tabled by the socialist group
the austrian people s party must accept some historical responsibility for this
it is our fundamental values which are at stake here as the democratically elected representatives of the european people we have no choice
we must reject what is unacceptable as our constituents demand
because when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation
i abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution
i condemn jorg haider s racist and xenophobic policy
however i cannot accept that an eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one member state
 sv obviously the political leaders of europe have a right and a duty to react against mr haider and his party
finland s experience however is that integration rather than isolation is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces
the eu presidency s common reaction against the formation of the government in austria is legally unjustified
the treaties do not authorise this reaction by the  member states
nor should we isolate the forces in austria which wish to work for human rights
that concludes the vote
adjournment of the session
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
the sitting was closed at  pm
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday  february 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the sitting on thursday  february have been distributed
are there any comments
i therefore propose to submit the minutes for your approval tomorrow morning since obviously you do not have them and i must apologise for this
i shall therefore postpone the approval of the minutes
madam president on a point of order
thank you mr davies
i shall look into this matter with the college of quaestors
madam president on a point of order
happy valentine s day
thank you mr murphy
as i informed mr davies i promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors
madam president on a point of order
i wonder on what point of order mr davies was speaking
gentlemen obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes
they will look into the matter thoroughly
thank you mr wurtz
i would ask you ladies and gentlemen not to start a debate at this point this was just a procedural motion
let me remind you mr wurtz that we shall be seeing mr prodi tomorrow he is going to make a statement on the commission s programme
i suggest that you clarify this matter at that time if you so wish and if mr prodi agrees
madam president it is with great regret that i have to trouble you yet again with an issue that i have raised here twice before
i have already told you on a number of occasions that we on behalf of the dutch contingency would like a dutch television channel
i was promised back in september that there would be a dutch channel by january
it is now february and we are still waiting
i would ask you once again to work on this
i wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite
mrs plooijvan gorsel let me say how disappointed i am because i personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago
i have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and i believe that mrs banotti has an answer for you
i shall therefore with your permission give the floor to mrs banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion
madam president as my dear friend elly will know i will do anything to make her and my dutch colleagues happy
if it is of any comfort to her the irish have not got their channel yet either
there seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this
i think we must do what we can to see that all members can receive their own national channel
thank you mrs banotti and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this
agenda
a sittings from  to  february  in strasbourg relating to wednesday
president
is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal
since no one wishes to speak i shall put this proposal to the vote
parliament gave its assentrelating to thursday
president i have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance
as you know we can only include five items in the human rights section
according to the list given in the final version of the agenda there are already four items
we can therefore table only one additional item
who wishes to speak on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party to propose the addition of an item on cambodia
madam president this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time
firstly the european parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of general pinochet but furthermore there are certain questions to be borne in mind
we are in favour of the international criminal court but it does not yet exist
parliament rejected the proposal president
we now come to the third proposal which is for environmental disasters in the waters of the danube  a proposal tabled by the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
is there a member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal
it affects not only romania but also yugoslavia and in fact the entire danube basin
parliament gave its assent president
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the ppe in favour of this proposal
it is not a very timeconsuming matter but it is extremely important that it should get through parliament now and that there should be no delays
it is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting which is an extremely urgent matter
we have tried to drive this proposal through
i should therefore be very grateful indeed if the chamber could support it
parliament gave its assent
relating to friday president
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the pse group in favour of this proposal
madam president with apologies to my friend enrique baron crespo i should like to speak against this proposal
i am surprised it has even been made because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the conference of presidents
i think that your proposal madam president to keep the debate and the vote separate with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date is a reasonable one
the reason is as follows this issue concerns no less than    employees within the european union
we already have a directive
it is not an old one it was issued in 
i propose therefore that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date
madam president i clearly owe mr wurtz an explanation and i am going give this explanation before the whole house
we had reached this agreement on principle in the conference of presidents
madam president i should simply like to ask mr wurtz to take a second look at what this is about
that is why i should like to support the social democrats request to hold the vote on friday
parliament gave its assent
in general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic
on friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda
that is absolutely absurd
i really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed
this is all i am talking about here just that
madam president i would like to talk about an item on the agenda for wednesday which you have not yet announced
i understand that there is agreement on this issue
these are serious allegations
they are completely untrue malicious politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood
we are taking legal advice
my colleagues register of interests is complete
quite we agree absolutely
b sittings of  and  march  in brussels
sustainable urban development  rural development  equal initiative
first of all i would like to remind you of the function of the interreg community initiative founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation
this programme constitutes a driving force for development on the european scale
these programmes promoted crossborder transnational and interregional cooperation within the european union by encouraging balanced development of the community area
the adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on structural funds
i belong to the great majority of members of parliament who voted in favour of continuing the interreg community initiative programme i regret that parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency but i acknowledge that this was not an easy operation
for the  period provision has been made unfortunately only for a total contribution of eur   million and an indicative allocation for each member state has been set
this objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this house
it is an important community initiative which together with the three other initiatives urban leader and interreg is financed out of the structural funds
nevertheless technical assistance is necessary
i have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report
a compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers
equal should live up to its name and this is my firm intention
it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the european union
it should prevent society from splintering
it should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life
everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age gender or origin
that is my intention and i would ask the house to give this report overwhelming support
just a year ago when the commission produced its proposals around agenda  it axed the urban initiative
urban policy has always been at the forefront of eu policy
for example in my own region in manchester the urban community initiative has been a tremendous success
urban funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the uk in moss side
as regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity
in committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 
we are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of  is not the key factor
the member states should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations
this needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the eu criteria
i would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that
often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency
we therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime drugdealing and gangs
this is all too familiar in many of our urban areas
i would like to see those actions extended to cover health and antidiscrimination as provided for in the amsterdam treaty
the community initiative means community involvement
some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents
we need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes
the timescale therefore proposed by the commission is very ambitious
this is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks
finally i should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the postindustrial city we require local participation
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty dependency and alienation with equity initiative and participation
for this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under interreg iii
the measures eligible for funding listed in annex ii of strand a do also seem encouraging in this respect
we would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies
these objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy
only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives
mrs stenzel s report has however turned out very well at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned
all asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes although this should be selfevident
nevertheless the conservatives voted against this in the committee
i would ask them the following questions does your policy seek to marginalise people
what is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so
does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability
the committee based its conclusions on these critical comments
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it
however criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee
a good opportunity to discuss the results good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost
this coordination is at present lacking and the commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it
we here in parliament are waiting for the commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible
it is of decisive importance to get local business organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes
experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful
projects have often remained halffinished and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy
we also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement
our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee
this is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn
mr president ladies and gentlemen interreg is one of the most european of all the structural funds
unfortunately this is only true for part of the money that is only for the borders within the eu
but it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster crossborder cooperation
the regulation pretends that there is one but there is not
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded
since  parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties
nothing has happened
the difficulties are once again being allowed to persist to the detriment of the regions concerned
we want a europe for the people and not a europe of paperpushers
mr president a third of eu money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes
that is a question of solidarity and progress
but dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending
the local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience
they find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes
he was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas
after all innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without european funding
the discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied
let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population
this could prevent local governments that are functioning in a shortsighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start
one of the objections is that due to the restricted role of the elected bodies businesses gain more influence
we believe in one man one vote more than one share one vote 
some areas within the european union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita
there must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a europe of the cities alone
mr president quite a few towns and cities within the european union have to contend with deprivation
the member states do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately
in common with mrs mccarthy i have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced
as far as the budget is concerned as already stated urban is there to support and complement national policy
consequently we cannot support amendment no  of the greens as borne out in the committee meeting
structural support is said to cause subsidydependence
we would then be overreaching ourselves
i would like to finish off by making a general comment on interreg
when projects are implemented it is also important that they do not contravene general community legislation
according to the report issued by the court of auditors on the year  this is not an imagined risk
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects
i welcome the continuation of interreg and the priority which it has been accorded
however the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems
that is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects
when interreg is implemented it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned
this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed
this will cause practical problems in the future and i hope that despite this it will be possible to implement interreg effectively
the preservation of this community initiative in particular in the form of a new version  leader  is therefore greatly to be welcomed
overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects
in this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under leader is very welcome
agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the leader initiative
leader must now move into the implementation phase
five months are provided for this
that seems to me to be rather too long
efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible
for me this raises the following questions who will work there
how will these people be selected
where above all will the required money come from and where should this observatory be located
assessment and publication are part of this and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past
the community s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars which contradict the spirit of european unity
there must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border
a project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication
it is a sad fact that there are many hundreds if not thousands of communities in the european union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage
the programme has been extremely successful in ireland as indeed i know it has been successful in other countries
it is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative
this unfortunately is not the case in ireland
i applaud the innovative approach of the equal programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market
the development partnerships are a very clever idea even though they are experimental
i have two major concerns however about the development partnerships
they should be accessible to smaller groups accessible for them to be able to devise implement and monitor the programmes
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme
my second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems for example disabled people s access to the workplace
projects should also specifically address this problem
these concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes
i certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the west midlands
i now turn to the controversial issue of asylumseekers and refugees
it is only fair and right for them to be able to access equal in the same way as everyone else
thank you mr president ladies and gentlemen with the leader report rural development is very much to the fore
it must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the leader programme local operators have combined forces debated and prepared projects
these programmes have therefore been important channels for participative democracy the rationale of the citizen for europe
so the concept for leader should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes
one urgent question is therefore raised why when this programme has been successfully run for ten years is leader still classed as experimental
are there so many other european schemes which can boast  specific original experiments which were particularly successful
moreover i wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the commission wishes to restrict leader
as an ecologist let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and manysided approaches
the fact is showing solidarity with eastern europe is all very well but it is not enough
mr president i have a few very brief comments
the community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions
our response to rural decline has come late in the day but i suppose better late than never
in my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms
it behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival
as the commissioner knows farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development
in this regard leader has established itself as an effective development initiative
the voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated
yet through leader there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader eu and national policy
i urge you to look seriously at this problem
a break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers
this is an arduous task
only the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped
comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another
although a few other groups have been mentioned it is the member states in particular which are on the lookout
for example i know of one member state that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component namely refugees
i would therefore ask the commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups
it should not be the case that one member state under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle can decide that all funding should go to one group
this is not the case
it has to be redistributed time and again
it should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the finance minister s treasury funds
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here
i believe that this is actually a good thing
the position of parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear
the rules of procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful
so far some balkan countries have received aid from the phare and obnova programmes while others have not
accordingly we welcome the related references in chapter  of the european commission s proposed general guidelines for interreg
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured
we can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the alps and they are devastating
but i warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside
and neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore
the investment needs to be visionary
mr president i want to talk about the equal report especially the issue of the policy on refugees
last week we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the austrian government
some members of the committee however supported mrs stenzel s proposal and wordings
as i see it this means that mr haider s politics are already casting their shadow over this parliament
i hope that the chamber will be just as committed this time
mr president during the last eu financial perspective from  to  when there were  different initiatives in operation the interreg ii crossborder programme was an important initiative
the european union has played a key role in developing the border county region in ireland over the years
the european union is the single largest contributor with  million pounds to the international fund for ireland
the european union contributes  of the peace and reconciliation programme
that time is now past
this increased awareness does not however affect identity alone
it is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets
i am counting on the commission and specifically on you commissioner to allocate adequate resources for effective action
i understand the commission s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation
nonetheless there are many maritime areas between which links are already established
various local authorities around the north sea provide a prime example of this
interreg could well allow enhancement of such cooperation
such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the eu
i hope for their adoption
there is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared
my group will not be supporting those amendments
yet there is some risk of dilution of effort if we pursue too many objectives our overall effectiveness suffers
of course every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case
i would wish urban to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i shall confine my observations to mr decourriere s report
unfortunately it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas however
if that is the case we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times
no equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life
unfortunately developments are not moving in that direction
on the contrary
one can only hope that it succeeds
i am glad that leader is to remain true to this underlying concept
there is a problem however which we need to address together
of course this is also the basic idea
have faith in the successful results which leader has had so far
at the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic
that was the charm of leader and that should please not be lost
the involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the equal initiative and the projects
my group will be supporting amendment no 
mr president the report under discussion in the house today is doubtless of great importance
there are fundamental advantages for the whole of europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions
it is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for leader ii
there must of course be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups
like the rapporteur we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand iiia
with regard to interreg we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a european monitoring centre concerned with cooperation
i would like to thank the rapporteurs particularly mr decourriere for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making
it is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the european parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained
i believe that we should be pleased about this
its argument was one of priority
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds
disabled people have too often been left off the list
finally a word on interreg
it really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in  are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new interregional links
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen for the information of the house mr president i should like to make a clarification
chancellor schussel s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by chancellor klima
there is no change in refugee policy in austria
rural areas make up over  of the eu s territory and  of the population live in them
i should like to welcome in particular the new leader programme because of its comprehensive nature
this acrosstheboard approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way
in the future funding will no longer come from three funds but from the eaggf guidance section alone
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the eaggf is supposed to be an effective financial instrument
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness because the money should not be squandered recklessly
in addition i should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy
that is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers
leader should supplement already existing programmes avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible
the commission would have abolished urban but this time parliament drew the longer straw
it is good that urban is to continue as it has had good results at local level
there is an immense risk of exclusion
in many cities in france and england there are now slums breeding grounds for many sorts of problems
none of us wants south american type favelas in europe
we have to act now before it is too late
our cities are also of decisive importance for europe s economy
the economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellowcitizens and our environment
this is not policy it is life s simple logic
now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middlesize towns and cities as they do not have enough resources
mr president with the implementation of interreg iii european cooperation policy is entering a new phase
our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones
in its draft guidelines the commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past
this is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the mediterranean countries
that is a reduction of  /   compared with the previous cis
how are priorities supposed to be set here
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs
the commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under equal either
only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved
mr president i want to refer to the commission proposals on the budget line to promote the cap
this proposal will remove the current budget line b and create a new budget heading b
therefore i am putting forward these amendments to parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme
informing and training young farmers at european level is vitally important
i would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst european young farmers
but the commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included
i feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at european level about the cap
therefore i am putting forward three amendments
i would urge parliament to support them
these people live in areas which should benefit from these projects
i think however that you will all recognise your own comments
firstly on the subject of the urban programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns which a number of you termed arbitrary
i can understand your concern
that is my initial response to the threshold question
regarding urban i should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention first of all the selection procedure
some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic more transparent and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding
a second observation the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes
i have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme
this cannot however be grounds for an extension of the original time limit
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months
with regard to urban i should like to conclude with a final observation
one of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the urban initiative
i agree completely
let me repeat what i have said we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming
having made these general observations i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative
it is true i admit it and you are well aware of the reasons ladies and gentlemen
there is a delay in adopting the interreg guidelines in march or april 
i accept this i take note of it as you do
so much for the first comment
as your rapporteur has requested i shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand
fourth observation the european observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office
another point the coordination between interreg phare tacis and meda
it is true once again and i accept this objectively that there are still real legal problems
the commission must continue along these lines
i am making a personal commitment to do so
the commission attaches the greatest importance to this just as you yourselves do
so we are working within this framework and not outside it
everything that i have just said ladies and gentlemen demonstrates that the commission is resolved to taken the views of parliament into account
and there will not be less funds available than in the current period either there will be more
i should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new
there was also an observatory under leader i and leader ii
it has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual leader groups
the cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed  of the leader budget
i now come to the content of the report
in point  parliament calls on the commission to submit an evaluation report on leader ii immediately
we therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it
in point  parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives
in response i can only say that this already exists
it has already been compiled by the commission and i can make a copy available to any member of this house who is interested
i can only fully share your concern
i assume that the commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in march or april
and as soon as these are published in the official journal the remaining months  in fact six months  can be used to submit leader programmes
finally under point  the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines
that therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 
it will also continue to fight for member states acceptance of this
i will comment briefly on the  amendments tabled
here there are only three which the commission cannot accept amendments nos   and 
it can accept all of the others either in full or in essence
it is worth stressing that both parliament and the commission must put forward specific policies
i now come to the equal initiative which is of course based on article 
so on the basis of the treaty as it stands today the equal initiative is structured in that way
i have classified the issues raised by the honourable members into four groups
firstly the enlargement of the thematic areas
the second subject is flexibility and simplification
i agree with mr leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand
this would allow member states great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs
of course a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the member states and a network which will assist the exchange of experience
finally i would like to mention technical assistance
we are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available
first funding for preparation second implementation third mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience and fourth technical assistance
since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided we must say that external offices will be used
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon
the sitting was closed at  pm
approval of the minutes of the two previous sittings
the minutes of the sittings of thursday  february and monday  february have been distributed
are there any comments
the minutes were approved
madam president my habit is always to be here for the opening of the partsession on monday afternoons at  pm
thank you mr medina ortega
i too wholeheartedly regret this situation
this situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly
madam president i had the same experience as mr medina ortega yesterday
absolutely mr napolitano thank you
she could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an antinuclear demonstration in glasgow
thank you mr lannoye
i have received your letter and have already contacted the british permanent representative
i have a lot of sympathy with that protest
i have however no sympathy for mrs lucas trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity
i have also been arrested for protesting at faslane
i did not hide behind any immunity
i took the punishment that came to me
mrs lucas should do the same
madam president i would like to comment on the request mrs stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the community initiative equal until tomorrow
does anyone want to speak against mrs stenzel s request as supported by mrs ghilardotti
if not then we will proceed to the vote
parliament approved the request
mr corbett i have not received any notification
madam president i am amazed at mr corbett s reaction
he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here
we are solidly with our austrian friends who have proven to be good europeans in the past
they have our full support
applause
agenda
parliament gave its assent
commission s strategic objectives and legislative programme
i therefore immediately give the floor to the president of the commission mr prodi
i am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of america turned everything upside down
but more vital still is a europe that feels strong in the political arena
in years past the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions the mainstay of european life
some of you may find it lacks detail but no political structure sets out detailed fiveyear programmes
this is the european union not the soviet union
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years
this is an effective transparent way to proceed and involve all the european institutions and the citizens of europe
it will not be a philosophical paper but a practical paper full of focused proposals
as for internal reform you well know how committed my commission has been to this since day one
this is the new element that we must help to bring to the balkans
we must increase our efficiency in this area we must reopen the danube to boats
nevertheless we definitely have to do more
if we do not do this we shall have failed in our duty
this is what we need to do for the balkans
there will be friendship calm openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process
i repeat we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own member states with even greater reassurance
our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement or at the balkans
we should remember that we the european union are a union of minorities we are all a minority within europe
some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message i sent to chancellor schussel
my message to you is do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that i have been less firm in the content
last november the commission tabled a proposal for an antiracism directive
i will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme the economy and quality of life
the forthcoming lisbon summit on these issues  dissemination of technology employment  will be a decisive summit
it has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind
we are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers
finally our last commitment is to improve quality of life
the time has come to discuss and then establish a body for emergency civil protection in europe
all too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred
i think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen
these are the challenges that we  the commission but also all the other european institutions  are facing
how will we judge ladies and gentlemen madam president the five years of our mandate
how are we going to assess the results of these five years
i do not know but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together
let us take a very simple parameter turnout at the next european elections
if it is higher than at the previous elections it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge
this ladies and gentlemen could be the decade of europe indeed i would say that this must be the decade of europe
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document
and we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which president prodi has just given
we read in the conclusions in the document that the fiveyear term of office of the prodi commission will be a time of major changes
a demanding ambitious perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success mr president of the commission
i say that in all earnestness and i have chosen my words carefully
i refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the european union
we in the european union are one community
we belong together even when there are problems
now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying europe
mr president of the commission you have represented and defended the european parliament time and again over recent weeks
you have seen yourself as the guardian of the treaties and that is indeed your role
applause
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as europeans
negotiations with six central european countries are starting today bringing the european family a step closer together
we agree with what you said about the barcelona process
we therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact
we need structural reforms in the european economy
we too want to help put europe on its feet
you spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity
we support that
the nations regions towns and communities of europe will be preserved
if you are persuasive in your actions we all reap the benefits
in this respect we wish you every success however we are also aware of our role as the commission s watchdog
applause
we are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances
what we need here is good government madam president
i have absolutely no doubt about this and i believe it is an essential point
in this regard madam president i would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language
last week the new minister for finance of the austrian coalition described the austrian parliament as a farce and a theatre
those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments
there can be no democracy without a living parliament
i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now
nevertheless i would point out to the commission that as far as the socialist group is concerned there has been a change of priorities
i believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue
does the commission think that there will be never be any revision
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential
with regard to governance in general i believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms
i would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity
if we are capable of defining what our area of governance is i think that would be very positive
in all other areas i believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion
not only should the commission discuss this but also our states our parliaments and our civil society
they are political because we are moving on
the challenge of enlargement is political
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political
because it is political it is more complex
because it is political it is more sovereigntysensitive
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real
we need more dialogue not just with each other but also with civil society
we need more explanation of what europe is about
we need to be able to confront fears and anxieties because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that
we see enlargement as a process of partnership not a process of them and us
we see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully
on southeastern europe i agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreements but we would like to see more
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the swoboda report later this week
the strategic paper emphasises the global role of the european union
we need to open that debate
in conclusion this morning the day after st valentine s day the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over
i do not know whether you are a romantic or not mr prodi
perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning
that is the way it should be
you gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme
at the same time however it has to be said that unfortunately your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto
there are a lot of good intentions in it but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved
as in any other party manifesto it is full of contradictions
i would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them
first let me speak about the economy and social development
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference
the eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone
in this respect parliament will definitely defend along with yourselves the importance of supranational decisionmaking
one contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation
i think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of global administration  as others too have said here
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community
do please try to make the international organisations democratic
we can submit motions for this together with you
you ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the igc
we have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decisionmaking
what you just said is absolutely true people want more engaged democracy
in my opinion this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to europe and their interest in europe too
the main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists
there are plenty of areas for serious discussion
we will carefully study the planned white papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the commission communication
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view
my second criticism follows on from the first
but all is not lost
my group is fully intent on helping with this work
on this specific point i think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decisionmaking procedures of the commission
this is a scenario whereby the european union has a membership of over  member states
i do not want to see a twotier european union built
i believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of rome and all subsequent treaties
more or less each of the  states in the us has two elected positions in the united states senate regardless of its population
any future reforms of the european union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country
once again there are special areas of policymaking which should be left to the domain of the national member states
i support the enlargement of the european union
i support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner
madam president i am speaking on behalf of the italian radical members
president of the commission a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out fiveyear plans
what do we expect from a government in any case
what do we ask of this structure  the european community  which is so to speak ambiguous and unique

we approve of your position on this you did well not to isolate that country any further
in any case we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action
mr prodi i repeat that this is in our opinion a slightly shortsighted view
above all it lacks drive in the sectors i have mentioned for example as regards the balkans
i remember your predecessor s speech five years ago
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation
you talk about greater transparency but produce proposals which would lead to documents which at present are available for public inspection being locked away
your commission consists of the only  people in the eu who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced
local politicians cannot do that once legislation has been passed in brussels
even by this stage that is already too many by far
what he envisaged was what he called a small practical secretariat
that is not what mr prodi is president of today
but how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high
we need to match this vision with reality
here there are three elements i would like to contribute
firstly we need a successful european economy
without a successful european economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead particularly of enlargement
secondly we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary  subsidiarity
doing less but better  a central plank of the last commission  needs to be the aim of this commission too
we will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation
we must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes
lastly we need to ensure that there is proper genuine reform of the european commission
the commission is not in fact today a european government
the commission does not reflect the majority in this particular parliament
we in parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in europe
i fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions
that does not apply to austria alone
when it comes down to it articles  and  of the treaty are not enough
we are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house
in this respect what the commission says about boosting europe s voice is important
i hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the commission documents
you have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on socalled core tasks
enlargement  and alleanza nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this house  must not mean dilution that is it must not entail more risks
even today we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics
i would also like to say a few words on africa madam president
the third and fourth worlds have been abandoned just one dollar one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children
one final remark regarding the internet and globalisation
as for the internet europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket
the ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic
is it not rather melodramatic to say that the world looks up to europe 
moreover europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen eu member states
it is not rather ambitious to ensure peace democracy and human rights in the whole of europe no less
i am particularly intrigued by how the commission considers bringing this about
according to the commission external policy can succeed provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge
so who is this then
the commission as a whole its president perhaps the council
you stated that the new european government requires strong institutions while the commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks
we could not agree more with the latter
the document mentions common values on different occasions
unfortunately i find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking
this raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on
i am convinced that the bible god s word is the only pure source of proper standards and real values
in the tradition of our continent this realisation is an important one which merits recognition
have you already included your second term of office
but seriously
as it enlarges the union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation
first streamlining
the activities of the entire union must be reduced to core areas of policy
secondly the new in word is flexibility
however increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation
we must hold fast to joint decisionmaking institutions which embrace the member states
that also applies to the inclusion of the civil society which is a welcome step
our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers
applause
that is transparency
thirdly the european union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly
its borders are set not by how may countries want to join but by how many countries it can accommodate
applause
if the price of enlargement is the wateringdown or even the breakup of the present union then it must not be paid
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new better quality of life
in doing so we need no less to reinvent the european union but without destroying the present union
applause
the commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the union as soon as possible
on the other hand we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down
it is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the union will be raised at the igc
the subject needs to be discussed without prejudice
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners your inspiring speech mr prodi has quite won me over
it raises expectations but it can also lead to disappointment
the enlargement of the union is inspired by our wish for peace security and stability
you are looking to reassure the acceding countries as well as european opinion
but these days we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes
this is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility
this is probably linked to the standards mentioned by mr van dam namely subsidiarity
it is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners rather than competitors when it comes to policy
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves
regions which culturally and economically sometimes match the interest of some member states
this is what the commission will be judged on
these ambiguities mask many misunderstandings primarily about our values
it is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat
this charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights
in the union for a europe of nations group our principles are rather different
clearly we want to defend the countries of europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations
this is not impossible
instead we must open the european institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations
the confidence of millions of europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the santer commission for corruption
not once does your twelvepage document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people
clearly they have no role to play in your strategy
your commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this
the governments which through spinelessness or ideology support you are also responsible
brussels is not all of us as you claim it is all of you
tell the truth for once you could not care less what the people of europe want
they are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement
it is over ten years since the collapse of the soviet union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism
we were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship
limited applause
it is a programme based on reallife situations and issues and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues
the fundamental element for the development of each person  his freedom which comes before economic gain  is thus enhanced
this social freedom which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability
mr president public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion
our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart
we hope that the white paper and the actions of you and your commission will put this into practice
what sort of impression will an interested public as well as the rest of the world have of this fiveyear programme
consequently we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom
the first concerns women gender and women s rights
you talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth
you mentioned women in your speech but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals
what other explanation could there be for omitting women
the eu must not take on a masculine persona
i would merely ask when this is likely to take effect
it is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority
without these prospects that we have outlined europe would once again have no future
i note that you consider the fall of the berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century
this event must underpin enlargement
rather than using the word enlargement  i want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance
your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks this is one of the goals of your reform
in essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity
however saying is one thing and doing is another
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers
i will therefore judge you on your deeds
in the meantime i approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication
however i must make two essential points these concern the simplification and application of community law
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential
community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic
the union must not make this mistake and i therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this
nevertheless i regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed
this is a silent revolution and in this respect i expected more from your communication
finally you do highlight european research as being at the heart of our future
yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this
also ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these
if you want to better inform the people you should start by strengthening liaison with this house as we are the representatives of the citizens
madam president mr president of the commission you have come here today mr prodi in a very reformist and ambitious mood
i welcome you and your ambition
ambition will be needed given the mammoth task which awaits us
we have  of the community s gdp
not a euro more or a euro less
it will not be us who refuse these new resources you should ask the council
these financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre
i would remind you that this group the ppede does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones
the political priorities must be set by this house and the meps
do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the community financial system
we therefore wonder whether the commission has the political will to resolve them
madam president the commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever
on one hand there are the words and on the other their real political meaning
we socialists applaud the commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled
what is meant by the commission s declared objective of economic reform in the labour market
does this mean more flexibility insecurity and fixedterm contracts
everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth
the union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient
we socialists desperately want a european pact for growth and employment
in this respect the eeurope initiative is to be welcomed
the gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era
for years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions leading inevitably to monopoly situations
all these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of   or  which are unrealistic in the long term
the unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase
to conclude the next five years will be crucial
there is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy
and do you know why
i would be grateful if the president of the commission would listen to what i have to say although of course he has no obligation to do so
let me give you three examples
that makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy
the same applies to european air traffic control
you still have not finished that agenda
commissioner far too little is said in your paper about regional policy
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community
if we fail to complete it citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement
then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it
i do not necessarily mean financial resources
the implementation of agenda  in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money
there must also be savings
but what we need is the analytical resources these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital
it is not easy to combine those aims there is no obvious way
perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse
madam president i want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this fiveyear plan
in setting very ambitious longterm goals we must not take our eyes away from the present
that was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group mr poettering in his opening address
that foundation is clearly the single market
how strongly is the single market established at the moment
this is the commission s own survey
these are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments  bureaucratic redtape blocking market entry
the commission s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved
an enlarged europe must build on the existing strengths of the union
the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement
madam president mr prodi ladies and gentlemen at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today
the serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme
the interlinking of the eu institutions the responsibilities of the member states and the local and regional authorities is all very well
yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and european construction
is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about who does what but more what are we doing together 
it is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens
this is why i and my group are so firmly insisting on the charter of fundamental rights
our people expect more europe but not just any europe
a paper this short is a farce
a paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard
we here in parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme
we want instruments to prevent abuse
on the other hand what does this statement tell us about principles
it is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve
we are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious
we have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply
madam president i should like to add my congratulations to commissioner prodi s programme
we must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the european economy restructured
after all what is social justice if it is without full employment
full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens
this is a key priority for us to focus on
yes eeurope will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs
that is important and something that can be developed through the lisbon summit
again this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity
i very much agree with you on that but we can take nothing for granted
there is still more we have to do and the lisbon summit will become part of that
so with those remarks i would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success
madam president mr president of the commission i should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme
unfortunately it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the commission
the commission gives no soul to europe
just a few main points
it seems to me that something is missing from this programme
truly european citizenship depends on our creating a real visible area of training and culture
declarations of principle are not enough
mr prodi what can i say what is there that is new
there is nothing new in your work programme
you have taken  pages for five years and  pages for one year s work programme
does that give me hope for the year 
no it does not
in your work programme for  you state something quite clever
you say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas
have you done so mr prodi have you even read your work programme for the year
no you have not done so
nor have you integrated it into economic policy competition or the internal market
you have not integrated it anywhere
you have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure
mr prodi you do not know what you are talking about
the foodstuffs legislation in the european union is the most ambitious in the world
where it falls short what is missing is transposition in the member states and monitoring
it is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day s work to be done
that is what we expect of you in the next five years

the next five years of the prodi commission  as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions  will mean great change
not a single line nor a single word refers to fishing or the cfp
i am not asking for details or specific points but i believe that a mention was required
does the commission intend to do nothing  at least it has announced nothing  about this reform in  either
this house has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second
i would therefore ask you mr prodi to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today
our parliamentary group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you
on behalf of the socialist group i would like to focus on the point of internal reform
they want to see results
this can be prevented if a european social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas
these are really the people who deserve our solidarity
and this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved
certainly not
this document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included
i think the fact that the commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious
it also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right unless we achieve real convergence the cohesion of the european union itself will be at risk
we should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the european union for which the commission is responsible
you may draw your own conclusions
i am waiting for the commission s report on the ultraperipheral regions which the council decided should be drawn up by december 
i shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion there will be no cohesion at all only disunity
madam president mr prodi europe needs a strong commission
you must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement however important this may be
your action programme and your objectives are reserved even silent specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed
this is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services
madam president the commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities
this body for example alongside the recently established crossborder body in ireland for food safety is already doing good work
it would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in eu legislation
that is something we must guard against
madam president the presentation by president prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair
we will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy employment policy and social policy
at the moment social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy
within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect
we need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now
the aspirations are fine president prodi we want those aspirations to be matched by action
mr prodi you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forwardlooking employment policy throughout europe
however for the economic sector which i represent ie fisheries this means change
we need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility
we must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry
this has since been unanimously approved
the fisheries policy is due for review in a few months time ie at the beginning of the year 
so it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper
i hope that this is a misunderstanding
please mr prodi stand by your word and implement your promises
however we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the commission
one area that i want to focus on in addition to those already identified is that of cultural diversity in europe
the introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important
if we do not take steps to deal with that we will fail ultimately
thank you mr de rossa
welcome
on behalf of the house i would like to welcome you to the european parliament
on the same day i understand mr balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead
the parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements
however the appointment was cancelled at the last minute
parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn
can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute
do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard
will you do everything in your power to ensure that such lastminute cancellations do not happen again
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible
without them we would not be able to function
mr president i also rise on a point of order
if there are such rules who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility
i think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway
mr president first of all let me say that i am in full support of a statute for assistants
but all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of parliament
i signed a letter yesterday afternoon in the meeting of the bureau of parliament in which the assistants were informed of this
but all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the socalled comart committee
thank you mrs banotti
i think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised
mr president i wanted to point out an important matter of principle
we shall now proceed to the vote
vote
however we have voted against paragraphs  and  because they seem to us to be legally incorrect
we have also voted in favour of paragraph 
given the oral amendment we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done

in terms of human rights this is a backward step
kosovo albanians and serb deserters are being refused refugee status whereas pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution
mccarthy report a
secondly when deciding which areas must be subsidised we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects
disparate actions are not effective
finally we have to put our trust in and support the institutions which are closest to the citizens that is the local councils and bodies
mr president i would like to point out that i voted for this report on sustainable urban development known as urban
as with all other community initiatives this is very positive
there can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city
 da the left s five members of the european parliament have chosen to support leader the equal initiative and interreg but not urban
however nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it
at best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work
at the same time the social and economic problems facing european society are more pronounced in urban areas
the concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved
the success of urban during the  programming period is indisputable
the results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas
this cip has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic social and environmental sectors
we can therefore welcome its adoption
we must however admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory
the total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge
the amount for the  period was eur  million and will be eur  million for the  period this represents a drop of 
this reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new urban initiative
the chosen threshold of  projects seems too low
it needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the member states
drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency
faced with these social challenges the effectiveness of the structural funds is still in doubt
the urban community initiative is helping to achieve the european union s desire to communitise urban policy
it would be more appropriate for the eu to concentrate its financial efforts on preexisting european policies
we should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project
in fact the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility
finally the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities
we can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion
on the other hand it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination this is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful as shown by the us precedent
for all these reasons the french delegation of the uen group could not approve the mccarthy report
decourriere report a
mr president the interreg programme is particularly close to our hearts
like many of my colleagues i am pleased that the european parliament was able to safeguard this initiative
these projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development
why am i stressing this point
i am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction
as an mep from a border region i welcome this third interreg initiative with great interest
this is why the interreg community initiative was launched in 
i must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of european integration
interreg resources must also contribute to the development of a european research area
i hope everyone like mr decourriere whom i congratulate will realise this
 fr the interreg community initiative is just one element of an illfated european regional policy
this apparently generous policy officially intended to help problem regions is a fool s bargain for french taxpayers
france contributes  of the european budget yet will receive only  of the regional structural funds
between  and  our regions annually received an average of ff  billion but will receive only ff  billion between  and 
my region of nordpasdecalais will be particularly affected with french hainaut losing the aid paid to objective  regions
this loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by freetrade europe
the european regional policy also reinforces the centralism of brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the structural funds
this is a europe of regions in which the regions which are weaker than the nation states will easily submit to brussels
however mr decourriere does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the brussels technocrats
these failings will result in particular in the late implementation of interreg iii and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid
these are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous commission
this is why the national front voted against the report
i want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this community initiative
this is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the eu which is at stake
the european commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions
this would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east
the maritime world has great potential
 da the european project began as a partnership between states
this partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of europe for over  years
the eu should be prepared to meet that competition
we can only do that by intensifying cooperation within the community
it is about cooperating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides
i therefore welcome the continuation of the programme
it is up to washington not us to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests
the french delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the decourriere report and will choose to abstain during the final vote
procacci report a
 pt although this community initiative leader  follows on from previous initiatives it has some unique features
one of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period
nevertheless new objectives have been included specifically the financing of the nature network  for which all rural regions will be eligible
without agriculture the rural world will disappear
our position on leader is a product of our more general assessment of the eu s overall agricultural policy
we think leader  will be even more ineffectual than leader  and leader  for the following reasons
this is because the  increase is nominal and not real granted that average yearly inflation in the community during those years was approximately 
leader  will last a year longer than leader 
we disagree with many of the report s views
once more we point to the negative changes of the cap   agenda 
for our part we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes
amendment no  replaces government or municipal officials with government officials 
the rapporteur s phrasing was therefore too limiting
amendment no  responds to the expectations of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism of this house
it specifies the necessary coordination between leader  and community cooperation and partnership programmes such as interreg phare sapard or meda
in essence we are of course in favour of this leader  community initiative
the budget allocated to leader  for a period of seven years is half that allocated to leader ii for a period of six years
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
additives in feedingstuffs
as far as we in the committee on agriculture and rural development are concerned so far so good
however the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics drugs growthpromoters and geneticallymodified organisms
we asked the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market which pointed out that as far as approximating laws is concerned article  is adequate in this case
we have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the commission on the text
the commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future
we are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to geneticallymodified organisms
in other words we do not need to renegotiate the text we merely need to adopt this text in the directive
i can hardly wait commissioner byrne to hear what you have to say to our proposals
as far the commission and the legal affairs committee are concerned it comes under competition
we want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and mr doyle s proposed amendments nos  and  therefore deserve our support
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions
consequently we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger ie harmful additives in feedingstuffs
otherwise in my view we are beavering away at the symptoms but not the causes
people are especially wary of gmos
and thirdly if we are to have a transparent consumer policy we need to label geneticallymodified feedingstuffs
responsible citizens should in my view have a choice
we all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety
by regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently we can help significantly to restore confidence
i too therefore can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments
consequently we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be
in other words we shall be discussing other proposals here in parliament over the next few months
however the committee on agriculture and rural development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the commission proposal
the regulation proposed by the commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives
this would then apply until the reassessment procedure has been completed
this already gives us a basis for the authorisation of gmos
the labelling of geneticallymodified additives is particularly important in this respect
finally our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur who has gone to a great deal of trouble
i think that we can all hardly wait to hear mr byrne s reply
however i should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics
it is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves
several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same
we talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but in the case of antibiotics it has long since been forgotten
however there is another environmental principle at stake namely the exchange principle
i should like to say a few words about coccidiostats
they are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary
there is a substitute which is used to vaccinate chickens
although it is a little more expensive it does not harm the environment
we must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals
however before labelling we need clear rules
straight questions must be asked about the real enduse of animal meal for example
this directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own
other directives will follow and i believe that the committee on agriculture is well placed to deal with them
the negative consequences are well known the positive ones less so
however more work is needed on this
mr president may i commence by congratulating the rapporteur mr graefe zu baringdorf on his report
i welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds
those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely
i compliment the new commissioner responsible for food safety mr byrne
this will make the island of ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production
a coherent legal framework must be reestablished
as of october  the commission proposed introducing a legal basis into directive eec for the replacement of the authorisations
however we must ensure that competition distortions are not created as highlighted by mr kindermann and mrs auroi
the consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision
this proposal has no financial consequences for the community budget
there must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety
we therefore welcome the commission s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs
nevertheless i should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points
first perhaps i should say something on the question of the legal base
therefore and i must address this comment to you mr byrne i reject your choice of legal basis
if it is merely a handmedown legal basis taken over from previous directives then it is a mistake to keep it
if we do not change it and we follow the legal affairs committee we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation
allow me to comment briefly on two other points first genetically modified microorganisms in feedingstuffs
the rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign
there are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet
mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report
this is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future
we must strike a balance between them
we must resolve this issue because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat
one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned
gmos are the new challenge facing us
this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so i myself share these concerns
we have had the dioxin scare bse and many other problems
the main problem is a financial one namely who bears the cost
we need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred
we must also ensure that the food that is imported into the european union meets the standards within the european union
the commission proposal is as some of you have said rather technical
nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives
the purpose of the commission s proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists
the scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited
five amendments have been presented by parliament
i shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately
the first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing article  with article 
i would simply point out that the commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection
i note that parliament s committee on legal affairs and the internal market also accepts that article  is the appropriate legal base
i remind parliament that in article  the primary objective is the protection of health
i am the first to accept that gmos are a very important issue
however this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives
the commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by parliament in its amendments
i can also assure parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account
i should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate
this is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives
the text taken by parliament is from the directive which was adopted in 
it is before parliament for second reading
it is my belief that we should await the final outcome of directive  and in particular article 
reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies
mr kindermann and mrs auroi made reference to this
there are just a few points i should like to make on that issue
indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product
the jurisprudence of the court appears to be quite clear in relation to this
a number of you made reference  mr nicholson in particular  to the issue surrounding labelling
directive  foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives
it is already included now indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products
so this issue will be addressed
mr president allow me to ask the commissioner one more question
first allow me to point out commissioner byrne that the european parliament has no right of legislative initiative
for example you did not go into antibiotics
we are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives
commissioner byrne it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with parliament
we negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years
i look forward to the next round
i would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue
it is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way particularly in directive 
it is best to wait for that debate which i understand will take place fairly soon
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation
thank you commissioner
parliament has taken due note of your comments
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
scrapie
from this point of view we are slightly behind the times
i am therefore in complete agreement with the commission s proposal on scrapie
we insist on this
here again the commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by parliament
and it is still on the agenda today
the cast is always the same
although the cause was unfortunate it was certainly not the worst experience of this parliament
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the environment committee is a very simple one
i have yet to submit my report on tses to the house
at first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now
but i have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing
this debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity mr byrne to give the commission a few things to think about
it will become more difficult once we see the tse proposal mr byrne
when we have the chance to ask direct questions the questions which mr boge referred to will be asked
how will bse status in fact be defined then
do you envisage circumstances under which the bse status will depend on the willingness to apply a bse test
when will you make it compulsory
perhaps you will do so before parliament debates the tse report
i know that i am a thorn in your side on this but sometimes that is my job
that is without doubt too short too sweet and too little
finally just one more brief comment mr byrne
we have a new commission
whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this commission and the president of the commission only time will tell
but you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this
and you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset
we should not allow food safety to be compromised because in the final analysis it is our health which is at stake
this is even more important given that there is no clear proof that bse and scrapie are unrelated
animals are bought throughout europe and transported over the entire continent
the spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers
and i should point out that for the first time in history a case of scrapie was detected in austria about four weeks ago
the disease is always fatal
as a farmer myself i am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk
i therefore welcome the commission s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie
in the previous speech mrs schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease
it is indeed
i wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease
mr president i too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur
it is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of parliament because it is extremely important
regardless of the many other concerns we may have bse has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved
it is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem
i welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will i hope address this situation
noone would want to see what happened to farmers with bse happen ever again
we have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work
bse has certainly not gone away
you can see it in different countries
it will be there for some time to come
if we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future
i should also like to thank mr boge for his work on this issue
this proposal addresses all tse risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain
the detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal
i look forward to receipt of that document which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
community policy in the field of water
yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet
furthermore europe has signed international conventions in particular the ospar convention in which it made certain commitments
the european union s water policy is not starting from zero
the preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation
in many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts
we must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us
yet we do not have much time
it is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved
it is also clear that if we do nothing our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner
even now the rivers in brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism
to conclude the issues are clear at this second reading
do we or do we not want standards compatible with ospar in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero
do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the council for this directive
do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples
we reduced the  proposed amendments in the environment committee to  but another  have been added
you see there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different
some want tighter legislation some want more clarification others want to serve national interests
our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the council of ministers
we obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the european parliament s credibility
for me that includes the zero demand ie the demand for zero inputs up to 
that would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings
farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days
you can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water
i therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises
the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative
nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us
we wish to ensure that article  of the directive promotes the sustainable efficient fair and considerate use of water
one example is water transfers
we would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to community supervision
we want to build a europe with a sustainable and healthy environment
however an environmental europe cannot in any circumstances be built at different speeds but must be built from a point of view of solidarity
discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the northwest of england will end up on the beaches of mainland europe
this brings home the connections which bind us together
it is important for us to remember that this is a framework
these brushstrokes are indeed very broad
it is easy for individual countries for individual sectors of industry to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days
there are many opportunities to hide
the reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come
that is the time to debate some of these problems of detail
there is a chemical factory in the northwest which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation
this is something that they prefer to avoid doing
the principle also concerns water charging
i want to refer to the political position here
the common position has weakened the stand taken by parliament at first reading
some of the ngos would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless
it is a retrograde step
this is an opportunity for us to improve the situation
we need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation
we have seen vote after vote lost
measure after measure has come out of the environment committee
we have failed to achieve a qualified majority
our attempt to improve the environment of europe has failed
we need to get into that conciliation position
we need at the end of the day to ensure that we end up with a sensible balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost
a hundred and twentynine chemical substances had to be regulated
eventually standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances
the unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle
this sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under british socialist presidency
that position is like holey cheese or to keep it the sphere of water as leaky as a sieve
it explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the committee on the environment nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading
this is unusual but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes
the dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak
the chemical industry and unfortunately the european commission and the council of ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance
only the background level of the ocean is acceptable
this is what is meant by the term closetozero 
the commission already has a list of  priority substances many of which have a hormonederegulating effect
i would like to mention two substances from the commission s list mercury and tributyl abbreviated to tbt
on the bottom of the wadden sea the values of mercury and tbt are higher than the ospar value to wit ten and one thousand times respectively
for the substance tbt this means that it can no longer be used as an antifouling substance
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship s sides mechanically
mr president the european parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the water directive
the council s common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas
therefore our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete
firstly we think that the timeframe for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the council
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive
secondly i should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently
there should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented
the legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions such as the ospar convention must be respected
thirdly we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy
this means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used
nowadays taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming
we should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended
i cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned
however some people in our political group think otherwise
consequently amendment no  on the same question has been tabled by one section of our group only
mr president every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet yet the abundance of water is an illusion
water is a renewable but limited natural resource
it becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable
we are not fortunately at this point
however we are in europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods which the directive underlines
for example france the rhine valley and central europe recently suffered flooding
yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water
the water issue will definitely not be settled today
in fact the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects
this is enough reason to thank mrs lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water
it seems rather complicated to attain a proper european legislative framework
however a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability
mr president we need to get used to the idea in the st century that we have to show water a completely new respect
it is not an easy topic and in my opinion the efforts made by mrs lienemann are very laudable indeed
the decisionmaking process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage
it is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge
i would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail
i would first of all like to focus on quality
the netherlands is significantly affected by the european water policy
a very important component to wit one third of our drinking water is extracted from surface water in the netherlands
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality
in a number of amendments the proposed standards and especially the ospar standard for  are called into question
i would now like to say a few words on quantity management
in his poem herinneringen aan holland  reminiscing about holland  a famous dutch poet mentioned water too which with its neverending trail of destruction was feared and respected
in  we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology
mr president i too would like to start by congratulating mrs lienemann on her excellent work
water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right
water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples
this is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination
we need to recognise that water is a joint liability
cooperation within a catchment basin must be selfevident
too little operational capacity upstream or in fact excessive use can cause problems downstream
coordination is the key word here
the problem of water is becoming increasingly topical
changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation
some areas are becoming drier whilst many are becoming wetter
it is time for action
in march the second world water forum will be held in the hague
this forum stands for a worldwide vision
this vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control
the time for action is upon us
the european parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time
but we should not lower our standards too much either
the common position is not ambitious enough
this is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements or the ospar objectives
we need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 
this has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too
the ospar objectives are now being drawn up
a list has been compiled containing  substances which produce clear risks for the environment
needless to say the directive also needs to be binding
countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives
quality has a price but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future
it is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established
however i have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation
first ospar
merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough
what we need is a completely legally binding objective for ospar
only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and more importantly objectives which are enforceable under the law
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth
with closed production circuits this is possible anything else would water down the directive
let us grab our chance
i know that this directive may have problems given the differing situations of the various countries of the union as has already been mentioned
i understand this
there are also difficulties with the issue of transfers
however mrs lienemann s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water
mr president my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report
however i would now like to look at the areas of difference between parliament s committee on the environment and the council
the latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position
mr president i want first of all to say thank you to mrs lienemann for her report
it would be to send out the wrong signals both to european industry and to the european people
it is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters
the directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately  chemicals in circulation
we cannot afford to wait
mr president it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive
this situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy and especially in the agricultural sector
we can achieve this longterm objective by developing measures with demanding standards
this directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting
first there is wide information for and involvement by the public a rarity in a european directive
secondly there is compulsory cooperation
thirdly i should like to address the question of the timetable
compare it with what happens in december
we all know in december that christmas eve falls on th december and we start buying presents
but what would we do if we knew in december that christmas was in thirty years time
we all know what we would do which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy
the present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives
this cannot be done and it also in any case goes against nature
european agriculture would not for example be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread
i cannot vote in favour of the sections in the water framework directive which deal with these states of affairs
mr president ladies and gentlemen water is a precious raw material
millions of people do not even have clean water  a absolute necessity for survival  at their disposal
it should therefore not surprise us that water is the cause of wars
the capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs
general interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation
i have to admit that in flanders where i come from we still have a long way to go too
we were recently rapped on the knuckles by the commission regarding this matter
the common position is in this respect a farce a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the ospar agreements
the period of implementation can even be extended up to  years
by then my children will be older than i am now
you have to admit this is a joke
tomorrow we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children
either we opt for the amendments of my group of the rapporteur or the committee on the environment
i would like to finish off with this observation
in the past couple of months we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in belgium
what was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the council of ministers
in our own country this pressure was exerted by both flemish and wallonian environment administrations
they have opted for the weak common position in favour of our parliament s more drastic positioning
i really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green environment ministers in my country are aware
ladies and gentlemen fine words are no longer sufficient
we need to change tack completely
this can only benefit our credibility
the debate is suspended and will resume at  pm
the dialogue on europe  institutional reform
the next item is the commission communication  the dialogue on europe  institutional reform the issues at stake
ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do
we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the member states and in conjunction with the european parliament
we also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments local elected representatives nongovernmental organisations socioprofessional organisations and the media
we are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the european union presidency and the european parliament
i have indicated the conditions under which the commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits
we want to encourage debate among the people
so this is what we are going to do
we will have a budget of approximately eur  million for  which you will hopefully approve
we will launch this dialogue on  march in brussels in the presence of  young commission stagiaires
that is all i have to say for the moment
i welcome any questions suggestions or proposals from the members present
colleagues you know the rules
you are expected to ask questions not necessarily make lengthy statements
you have one minute each in which to ask your question
moreover this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by parliament itself in its resolution of  november
thank you mr napolitano
i can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of  november
these challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them
mr president commissioner it is music to my ears to hear you use the word citizen so often
mr dupuis first of all i attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word citizen 
it is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used
this public prosecutor would have the authority recognised by the eu treaty and therefore by the member states to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the community budget and interests
will you confirm what is the case
mr haarder to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing
generally speaking there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in austria i have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 
this is an economic community of course but it is also primarily a community of values
this is why i personally have an idea to supplement article  of the eu treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis finally this is why we have public debate
commissioner barnier you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of europe
clearly parliament has its own representatives present mr brok and mr tsatsos
mr beazley my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise
having said that the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions
mr president firstly i would like to compliment the commission on its approach
do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well that is to say via the television and internet
my second question is of a critical nature
the european commission has just issued a proposal on transparency
the group of representatives is currently meeting in brussels and i will try to join them as soon as possible
the documents will in the main be open working documents
we will open an internet forum and create permanent discussion forums
the commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised
these are the modern means to be used
however i believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people
i have evidence that this is possible
the majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions
he can come with both the hats that he wears as a commissioner
i would like to ask him how vigorous the commission will be in this information campaign
the commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign
mr corbett thank you for your comments
i can perform this dual task
ten days ago i was in westminster so you can see mr corbett that i am not afraid of the difficulties
next week i will go to the bundestag in berlin
i have already appeared before the french senate
therefore throughout this debate whenever i can i will go directly to see the national parliaments too
it is not much fun of course having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself
is not mr barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the member states election processes
can such matters be controlled from brussels
is this an element in the radical decentralisation which mr prodi talked about this morning
i do not think so
yes mr bonde we will be starting this debate with  young people in brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the commission
this will therefore be our rule
i am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues
i do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical
mr maccormick i agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals
it must get as close as possible to the people where they live and where they have their roots
we will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions
mr berthu the helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this
it specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in amsterdam
everything which can be done will be useful i am sure that you and i mr berthu can at least agree on this
thank you commissioner
you have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for europe that you referred to
you have set a very good example of timekeeping today
that concludes the debate
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
first part
question no  by h
this results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it
the statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable
however the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population
however efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a selfsufficient healthcare system in the province
unmik has already taken a significant role in this field
progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city
however the commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of unmik for this project
we hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation
the commission is now turning to the programming of  funds
we expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system
the emphasis will be on longterm reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement
work is already under way with unmik to determine an appropriate contribution from the commission to this enterprise
besides commissioner is socalled humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in kosovo
do you think that so much inaction is excusable when on the continent of europe itself the right to life is at risk
i am sure the honourable member did not mean that
as a result of that a parallel health care system was put in place through the mother teresa society
so what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic underinvestment
those were cases in which women who during the hostilities or before the hostilities tragically killed their own children
we are dealing with a horrific story in kosovo
commissioner i would like to thank you for your response to the member s first question and the supplementary question
in some cases there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like
are you aware of this
are you prepared to act upon it
this is my first additional question
my second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in mitrovica
what does the commission intend to do in order to ensure that albanian kosovars too can get to hospital
secondly i do understand exactly what the honourable member is saying about mitrovica
i was in mitrovica a couple of months ago i saw the situation there for myself
we will try to address them but it is not easy
question no  by h
mr president the commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of turkey to the european union
my question therefore is this will the commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions
we have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the tacis programme to armenia
let me relate my answer specifically to the question of turkish accession to the european union
as stated in agenda   and i quote enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts
that statement could not be much clearer
question no  by h
the commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the ilisu dam on the population of the region
i have a related point
it concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole
as you know the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to syria and to iraq in particular
can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well
we will certainly raise the point made by the honourable member
we have heard anxieties expressed on that point and i will ensure it is taken up
there have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area
we will raise that too in the representations we make
question no  by h
what are the commission s views on the substance of the charter what type of rights will the charter set out economic social and cultural
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes
what are the commission s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union
the rights conferred by this charter will have at least two types of beneficiary
some rights will apply to anyone present in the eu territory while others will benefit only citizens of the european union
as i have also said before to this house the commission is favourable to inserting the charter in the eu treaty
however we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the heads of state and government
we hope that this important cologne council decision will become a reality
globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other make it urgently necessary to define those rights
in this context the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated
i understand your concern about the rights of children
this is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully
each member state is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children
i hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable member has posed for the commission and the whole convention
however i should like to ask a slightly different question
it is very important that the people feel engaged in this process
will the commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate
i can assure you that the commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future charter of fundamental rights
there is no contradiction between the two
the challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the charter
i am very glad to know that i can count on your support here
question no  by h
i am referring of course to the statement made by the commission on  february  the basic elements of which i would like to restate
the commission confirmed then as it does today that it shares the concerns underlying the portuguese presidency s statement of  february 
these concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them
the commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars that of the rule of law
the commission is not a state it cannot and must not act as if it were one
i think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in austria
i would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary
the values at stake are too central too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises
individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say
in austria s case the statements are contradictory to say the least
on the one hand any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the freedom party
on the other hand the new austrian government s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights
we will soon have our first opportunity and an excellent opportunity it will be to see which one of these two faces of the freedom party is the real one
i thank the commissioner for his reply to my question
could the commissioner answer two questions
firstly he talked about verification
can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it
we are not talking about words here
we are talking about deeds by the freedom party and mr haider
regarding the situation in carinthia we need to look at this in detail
the honourable member raised the question
the protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the commission has put before the council
we should not only focus this debate on the austrian question
that question calls for reflection for debate and if necessary for action
thank you very much mr vitorino for your valuable contribution to this question time
second part
questions to mrs wallstrom
question no  by h
can the commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 
consequently the commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and since  has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned
the outcome of the discussions as well as of the indepth investigations which are being carried out in this area are now being examined by the commission
the commission is currently carefully reviewing the united states arguments
my question specifically concerned the reaction of the us government to the text of the preliminary draft
there have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one to my knowledge dating from july 
is this the text which you will be submitting or an amendment to the original version
thank you for the followup question
it is important for me to have a chance to answer it
the dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal
parts of it have been strengthened but other parts may well contain too many compromises
we are still in the process of preparing a text and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment
i start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these
however i do want to listen to all the points of view
however i totally reject any suggestion that i would allow the united states to determine the shape of our directive
in fact i believe that we should be showing the way an intention that will also characterise the final proposal
question no  by h
is the commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decisionmaking in the environmental field
in  the commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men
within the framework of the action plan each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures
one of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions
the new commission s own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office
currently women hold  per cent of our agrade posts and we hope the number will increase steadily
moreover we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups
thank you for your reply
this is a crucial goal

sv my understanding of mainstreaming is of course that this should characterise everything we do
my impression of environmentrelated work broadly speaking is that in many instances it is dominated by women
i should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention but there is certainly room for improvement
i have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up
i hope that this will be of benefit
question no  by h
is the commission ready to suspend funding completely pending a review of the development plans of the area
an indepth environmental impact assessment had been carried out
however since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute
firstly the irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements
they then renewed their commitment after an irish nongovernmental organisation began a legal challenge in the irish courts
however the new commitment included some minor changes which in turn led to a further complaint
 i do not quite understand what the commissioner said
it is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of eu directives
you say there will be no further funding
i would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation
if not why not
if you are when exactly are you going to do it
is this right and proper
what is your opinion on that
any eu funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of eu directives
even the area designated by the commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed
compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done
there is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities and does not require prior commission approval
we are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the structural funds
mr president sadly the specific case raised by mrs mckenna is not an isolated one
there are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of eu funding
it is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future

sv this is a very important question
the message contained in the joint text is still valid
the result may of course be some difficult questions of priorities
i should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good
the rules of procedure do not allow this
you will have to discuss this outside the chamber
questions to mr barnier

question no  by h
may i quickly add something to the answer given just now by mrs wallstrom to mr martin
i am also saying this as a former environment minister
within the third csf this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee
this is all i can say
i thank the commissioner and do not at all question his intentions and interventions which adopted a positive line
however things are really quite different
i cannot show you the television programmes here but i can show you the greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections
this is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates financed by the european union the csf
my question to the commissioner is this what is to be done
will the commission remain silent
will it discuss the matter
will it bring it up with the greek government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous commission
mr alavanos i see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited
then if it is really necessary for me to do this i will make comments or recommendations to the greek government
having said that i thought your question related more to the partnership issue
subsequently if i need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised then i will do this
i cannot do other than work with the greek government
what can the commission do about that
mr theonas i can only repeat what i said to mr alavanos
however i am obliged to respect the national authority with which i must conduct these negotiations
having said this i will look at the situation objectively
i am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted this must be remedied
i will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new community support framework

question no  by h
what role will aid from the structural funds play on the other hand in the promotion of renewable energy
will the structural funds also finance the largescale energy transmission networks
this is about  of the whole community contribution
could you please give an answer on this issue
you are concerned about whether the structural funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere
quite simply there is no question of this
as a result the commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected
however you are right to question me as this is your task as mine is to answer you
the member state or states concerned will then be required to answer me and i will send you this answer as soon as possible
i thought i had answered your question on largescale energy transmission networks
this is the only answer i can give you on the link between largescale energy transmission networks and the structural funds

question no  by h
in this respect it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the structural funds which must be additional
the cofinancing provided by the member state does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure
please excuse this very legal answer
 i am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content
very well that is to be the unchanging rule
does section  conceivably authorise the following practice
is that really authorised
i am aware of the member s competence on these matters
i also know the particular problems in your constituency in scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects
 additionality is a major issue too in wales which i represent
and yet we still have these problems in wales and in scotland
could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government
i take this to mean that the debate of which i was aware in scotland is also occurring in wales
question no  by h
questions to mr bolkestein
mrs izquierdo rojo i would ask all of you  and do not take this as a warning  to deal with strictly community matters
i know that these are very important issues in spain and there are differing viewpoints
i would point out to the commissioner that mr aznar is the president of the spanish government
you may answer the question
i have given you my answer
i am keen that the structural funds particularly those in objective  are allocated where needed
it is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible
i need to know about this allocation however and this is why i said that i could not answer today
as i did not have an answer i wrote to the minister for economic and financial affairs on  december
i regret that the commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and in this case passionate intervention
this is a fascinating debate which i realise is not totally communityrelated
i am pleased that the structural funds are the subject of discussions in greece and spain
we were talking a short while ago in this house about debates involving our citizens about public debates
i am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the structural funds regulation
this regulation was adopted just last year in berlin and i will be applying it for the next seven years
for the time being please let me apply the regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in berlin
this is all i can say today
thank you very much for your replies mr barnier
questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
question no  by h
the office is not yet ready to move into the new building
unfortunately a number of deadlines have been exceeded
the ohim is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by june
during the previous question we were discussing electoral issues
if you had been there i am sure you would have been ashamed
the president of the commission and some secretaries were present
the opening of a building which was not finished in the middle of an election campaign which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied makes the spanish government look ridiculous
i would therefore like to ask you mr commissioner does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign
does it seem normal to you that the commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the spanish government
it does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one member state or another
as such i would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which mr berenguer has just described
i have to confess that i fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in spain
what i can say is that i hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible
i hope that this building will then be occupied
i would like to point out to the commissioner that it is not an electoral question
a year later it is still not functioning which means that the commission spent money on a false opening
we should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified
i would like to reiterate that the commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of member state actions
it is however interested in official statements and actions
we do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in french un proces d intention
we are concerned with public official actions and events rather than any possible underlying motivation
this is why i find it also difficult to meet mr medina halfway and respond to his question
also the commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual
as far as i am concerned all expenditure is real
and any remaining skeletons i intend to leave them in the cupboard
question no  by h
i would like to answer these two questions as follows
this derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on  june of this year
sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years as this would be necessary to protect public health
my position on this is clear
i cannot see a reason therefore why a further extension for this measure should be proposed
that is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time
i have already had a chance to discuss my position with mr ringholm the swedish finance minister on two occasions
i also discussed this matter with the swedish parliamentary finance committee last week
it is now up to the swedish government to take the necessary measures
thank you for your reply
i have some sympathy with the commission s standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally
such a rule is only normal
my second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol
what are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the commission s work
if we had considered these aspects in their overall context then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with sweden
firstly finland and denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 
these countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 
however in the case of sweden the situation is different
in  a fiveyear derogation period was decided upon which is now lapsing
i have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the commission would need to extend this period
secondly the swedish government is being consulted all the way
thirdly i understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important
well now mr andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol
we can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the united states
mr andersson will be familiar with what was termed then prohibition 
i gather that mr posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter
as is known this has led to a state monopoly in sweden which in itself is at odds with union legislation
can we now expect the european commission to take action against the french republic before the european court of justice
the commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the european court of justice
i ask for the member s understanding for this small delay in the commission s decision
can you envisage applying an alcohol  equivalent basis for taxation in europe
the matter of excise taxes to which the honourable member is referring is the prerogative of the member state concerned
the commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products
towards the end of this year the commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between member states
that leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from france to the united kingdom
the question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax
the commission has no means of influence here
in the case of sweden the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol
there is of course elasticity of demand in this case a price elasticity of demand
i am not sure exactly what it is but it is not zero therefore it must have some effect
my question would have been almost exactly the one raised by mr purvis but i would like to press the point further
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products
that is indeed distortion of the internal market
if i had my way i would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across europe
as a result smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one member state than another
but i do not have a magic wand and i do not have my way
thank you very much commissioner
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the commission
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
community policy in the field of water continuation
to this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new member states in the east
in fact a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in romania threatening aquifers which supply the population of yugoslavia
i understand that mrs wallstrom whose presence here tonight i appreciate is going to visit the area
the development of this directive has been difficult and complex involving diverse interests and divided opinions
however it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations
we also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 
in no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution
mr president commissioner this is a very important directive
its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems
the public must have a right to clean water
it is important not only for the environment but also for public health
we must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality
action must get under way immediately
we cannot afford to waste time
it is important that the timetable is an ambitious one
it is a question of doing what is technically possible obviously it is not possible to do anymore but we must be sufficiently ambitious
i would like to comment on one issue which was spoken about earlier
i believe the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water
mr president madam commissioner congratulations mrs lienemann on an excellent piece of work
water and air surround us everywhere
we share them with everyone on this earth
water is a prerequisite for human life
and there are more and more of us in the world
mrs schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal
nothing could be further from the truth
it is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so too the conditions for life
it is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources
however we should look a little more closely at some points
mr president here we have what is basically a good measure
it sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management
its aim of goodquality water for drinking for wildlife the environment and economic purposes is right
we have three outstanding problems
the first is the transfer of water between basin areas
that is a matter which affects my colleagues from spain ireland and the united kingdom
secondly we have to have realistic targets but targets nevertheless
we need to look very carefully at those
the concept of continuing reduction as in amendment no  is much better
thirdly i raise the problem faced by scotch whisky
some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk
that is my third request  that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole
in that spirit we support amendment no  by mr marset campos
we are all entitled to clean drinking water
i should like to express my great appreciation of mrs lienemann s work on this matter
moreover i shall only highlight the most important ones
in this regard too i think that the  deadline is appropriate
i think that mrs lienemann s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the council
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive
first of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act
in finland surface waters are very clean
the process does not require a chemical sewage plant
the directive must not be allowed to endanger this work
this would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed
the ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by union acts
there are parts of europe with an inherent shortage of water and that should be taken into account by this directive
in recent years climate change has compelled mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain
however it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted
this applies to every country
mr president commissioner we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading
firstly i believe that this directive is excessively tough simplistic and reductionist
i say this because the ball does not need to be in our court this issue is in the hands of the governments and the commission
that is how the common position has been worded
the same can be said with regard to transfers
lastly i am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact
ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the european parliament amendments
a year rollout for legislation for example is hardly acceptable
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the eu
water is a scarce and precious natural resource
all legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance
these include for example costs and transfers
with regard to costs i would like clarification of what costs we are talking about
are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water
are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks
are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services
or are we talking about largescale hydraulic works and reservoirs
all these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector
transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas
is the commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in europe
they already existed in ancient times they had them in roman times although on a smaller scale
one of the most significant transfers  the tajosegura transfer  which has been in use for many years almost  years has an allowance of  hm per year
we cannot be accused of bad management
we are not doing a bad job of management
we cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it
i will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies because i believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive
take good note in this diverse europe which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation we have to find diverse solutions not single solutions
commissioner andalusia is not lapland
water is one of our most important natural resources as many speakers have already said
an ambitious and wellbalanced european policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for europe
water is also one of the issues to which i shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office
i am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to parliament
most of parliament s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious
the commission can approve  of the  amendments either in their entirety partially or in principle
many of the amendments which parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary
with a view to these forthcoming negotiations i would therefore urge parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position
firstly i should like to mention some of my most important arguments
we now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the ospar convention
rather than make these objectives legally binding we must consider their political nature
this is also reflected in many of parliament s amendments
it sounds good saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge
but water is not free of charge any more than houses or food are free of charge
it is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource
in the course of the debate many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed
i just want to emphasise this further
it is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them
this is also expressed in recital 
allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail
limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives
i am glad to see that parliament s amendments have focused upon this
the commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the ospar convention into the text
we must however keep to their precise scope and content
as i said their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character
it would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable
i therefore welcome amendments nos       and  
the commission cannot on the other hand approve amendment no  in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in ospar
the commission s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances and so no definition is needed
amendment no  introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed
this would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot therefore be approved
the desire expressed in amendments nos  and  for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved
lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances
the nitrates directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive
i also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs
i can therefore partly and in principle approve amendments nos  together with amendment no 
this would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured
i therefore support the overall thrust of amendment no  which is in line with the commission s original proposal
i also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources
this must not however be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution
we intend shortly to issue a communication from the commission on precisely this question
the same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years
amendment no  cancelling the third extension period is an important step in the right direction
this proposal can therefore be approved
a period of ten years as proposed in amendments nos  and  among others is on the other hand too short
this applies to amendments nos             and 
these amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found
to comply with the demands in amendments nos  and  to the effect that the commission should approve every extension would be going too far and these cannot be approved
another important area is protection of the groundwater
we also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring
the most important parts of parliament s amendments nos  and  can therefore be approved in principle
the new definition in amendment no  is however too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose
i would propose that amendment no  should be incorporated into a broader solution
amendment no  does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater
the proposal cannot therefore be approved
instead we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with article  to promote activities in this area
the good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled
this part of amendment no  cannot therefore be approved
the commission appreciates parliament s efforts to guarantee that the socalled combined approach is given a central role
this approach and its scope which the commission can in principle approve are defined by amendments nos  and 
in order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality we wish however to reformulate amendment no  and to add a de minimis provision
the transfer of water is already covered by controls but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer
these parts of amendments nos  and  can therefore be approved
it is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted
the proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned
these parts of amendments nos  and  cannot therefore be approved
the commission approves amendment no  to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal
to summarise the commission is able to approve  amendments either in their entirety partially or in principle
the following amendments cannot be approved                                    and 
important progress has been made and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions
i would like to hear the commissioner s view on amendment no 
i may have missed it in the list she gave out
 i accept that
thank you mrs wallstrom
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
financial instrument for the environment life
rapporteur
patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement
i would stress the lifenature strand in particular
but we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the european union s financial programmes and instruments
as for us we our bound by the terms of the texts a maximum of four months
it is equally true however that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering life i and life ii
it is better firstly because the framework proposal made life i more rigorous more transparent and more rational
we have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice
firstly life is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the european union
there is no other such policy
thirdly the life budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand
this means that approving the proposal put forward by the council and by the commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend
our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue however
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions ambitions for which of course there is a price
obviously the basic item for discussion with the council will be the allocation for life iii
the common position stipulates a total appropriation of eur  million for the period  this is not enough
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party is in favour of increasing this amount to eur  million
the amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure
quite the opposite it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded
a drop in the ocean i might say in comparison with europe s structural policies
the environment is still the poor relation in the european budget even though it is primarily an investment
more than one third of the  requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately  projects between  and 
in matters of the environment investment and ambition come in a variety of forms and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term
this is the price of the future of generations to come
this financial instrument is furthermore deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and nongovernmental organisations
through the associations then life is a facility that can be used by the european citizen directly and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community
for the record the budget for agriculture which has a real impact on the environment amounts as we all know to eur  billion
the first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those
we are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows
it is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions
secondly to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of life funds in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism
thirdly to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite
result a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself
this is the sort of thing that we want to avoid
four to include representatives of parliament in the monitoring committee at least one member per political group
what could be fairer than for members of parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for
fifthly to publish an annual scientific technical and financial assessment of life operations carried out
six to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis
seven to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency for example in reforestation following storm damage or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick etc
furthermore it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent
however i would like to insist on certain points
firstly its continuity which in principle i am not questioning
secondly the financial contributions
sadly only  of the projects requested receive funds
of the eur   million requested only eur  million have been granted
now the financial statement shows only eur  million to cover more countries and competences
parliament has proposed eur  million but the document repeats the initial proposal of eur  million
commissioner our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing
is this not a contradiction
let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves
commissioner we must be consistent
what has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the danube and its tributary has been instructive
two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic
so i will simply appeal to the commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue
the environment is in a parlous state
as regards funding eur  million is not enough even eur  million is not enough
however the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking
in many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the life programme have been established
but creating parks with very limited financial resources without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual
i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention
the commission welcomes above all amendments nos        and  which apply to the committee procedures
in these cases parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the commission had to the common position
the commission can in principle also approve amendment no  which ought however to be introduced into another place in the text
where the question of the budget is concerned i am pleased about the confidence shown by the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy
amendment no  requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position
i am also convinced that life has great potential
this instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget
the amount quoted in amendment no  does not however tally with the budget set on the basis of agenda 
account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decisionmaking procedure
at this stage the commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position
it is therefore meaningless and often impossible directly to transfer projects from life to other instruments
nor can the commission approve amendment no  which is contrary to the commission s right of initiative
the date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted
parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument
thank you mrs wallstrom
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
modernising social protection
mr president the issue of social security systems is an important one
this is a natural consequence of cooperation within the eu
it is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems
these areas are mutually dependent upon one another
economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment
it also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision
in other words social security is a factor of production
social security systems differ from one eu country to another
this is largely due to historical factors
the labour market is also changing
women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers
another challenge is presented by technical development
we must meet these challenges together
this is good but it is not enough
we propose a procedure like the luxembourg process
clear guidelines and indicators are required at the same time the member states are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans
we are creating a common model but retaining the principle of subsidiarity
this social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period
like the work on employment the commission s proposal is founded upon four pillars
all this is important
equality has no pillar of its own
there it is mainstreaming which applies
all four pillars should reflect aspects of equality
this is something we have borne in mind
these proposals favour women especially
we expect the commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme
the commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement
we have had a constructive discussion in the committee
we had a lot of amendments but succeeded in agreeing upon a report
now the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen
this indicates that we have a broad consensus
a number of these amendments have come back from the committee reading and these i shall reject
i shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the technical group of independent members because i do not think that these add anything to the report
on the other hand my group will applaud amendment no  from the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
i think this proposal is a good one
certainly it resembles amendment no  but amendment no  is better
finally i want to say that the eu is not only concerned with cooperation on trade
the eu is also a union for employment and social justice
in creating a citizens europe social policy has an important role to play
by means of this report parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of european society
we hope that the council and the commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy
the lisbon summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind
genderrelated aspects must feature prominently in all these goals
the commission s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about european social convergence
the commission has recognised this interrelatedness
these aspects are very much interconnected
we should of course not get overly excited about it
it marks the beginning rather than the end of a process
some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another
the challenges are different
in this way we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges
the majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen
it is a report which tries to give direction
there are however one or two aspects about which i have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific
i think that a number of meps will make reference to this
i believe that if it were to be adopted in lisbon in this way lisbon will turn out to be a success
all in all i am indebted to the rapporteur and the committee for this report
there have been times within this parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward
however we the parliament and in particular the group of the social democrats want lisbon to go one step further now
we believe that this course of action is ambitious yet achievable
needless to say it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at european level
but this new course of action is very exciting
finally we urge the european parliament both sides of industry and social ngos to be closely involved in this process
the success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support
it is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda
in the debate about coordination of social policy in the eu we often use the expression social convergence
it is not therefore about harmonisation but about common objectives
it is of course a fact that the eu countries have different ways of organising social policy
national policy is of course subject to a number of common parameters that is the case with minimum social entitlements which are established by treaty
i can support the report but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste
i feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier
this seems to be a good thing and useful
i also feel positive about the essence of the communication namely the strategic approach
we therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved
we nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found
the lion s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans eleven restrictions and two improvements
in the case of unemployment benefits we came across six restrictions and five improvements
policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries
the highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries
all in all both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole
this is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches
to use a figure of speech cappuccino is not always good for us
the european union s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy
so far social policy has remained limited in terms of setup and resources
but under the influence of the free movement of employees of the internal market and of the euro the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated
this has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent
in fact the same phenomenon occurs in tax law
indeed expansion globalisation a sharp increase in the ageing population individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable
denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection
indeed if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition this would also harm social protection as a production factor
in respect of the supereuropeans i would say that european social protection is neither attainable nor desirable
the path which the commission is walking is in fact obvious
i endorse this view
i will give my support to the commission and i hope that lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter
mr president mr andersson s report contains a lot that is of interest
social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the member states
something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the socalled european model into a parody
social policy must facilitate employment creating incentives for employers and employees to respectively provide and accept jobs
mr andersson s report demands social convergence that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the eu
the eu should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria which would be binding and of real effect
mr andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere
the eu should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created whatever that may mean
it is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference
those structural problems which make unemployment higher in europe than in the united states will become even greater
there is no need at all for supranationalism in this area
the member states can devise their own systems in the social sphere each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences
it is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the eu
mr andersson thinks that the less wealthy eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too
talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present member states and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant states are concerned
mr president as others have done i should also like to congratulate mr andersson for the report he has produced
i also welcome the commission s communication
it was slow in coming but well worth waiting for
i am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by mr herman schmid will not deal with that globalising world
this is not an option for us any more
it is an imperative
european citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings
what it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the united states
that is not what we want to do in europe
we have the traditions of solidarity in europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things
but we have to grasp the tools to do that
mr president in my previous life i ran two manufacturing businesses one in the united kingdom and one in the netherlands
the simple reason for this was that social costs in the netherlands were just too high in comparison
mr president we are unable to vote for this report
the european union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of europe
social rights should determine economic choices and not the other way around
the european union should proclaim one general principle to wit that the social rights acquired in member states may not be restricted
any community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator
in order to fight poverty entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights
i sincerely hope in conclusion that social europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes
for millions of people the situation is too tragic for that
until recently the european countries fixed it could be said in an autarkic way the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets
budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability
the structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot therefore be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade
and therein lies the paradox
hypocrisy and finesounding words such as convergence benchmarking modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions
that is something we would do well to recognise
all in all though i deem this report to be worthwhile
this message is contained in the excellent report by mr andersson
let us not forget that in   people came here to compensate for our low birth rate
it seems to me commissioner that the commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities
i would like to make a number of comments about what has been said
today we have the statement by mr andersson
i believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection
the second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the european commission can operate
the next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken
the portuguese presidency has focused on two things sustainable pension systems and social accession
i think the statement s content makes this clear
as many of the speakers have said i believe a first important step has been taken
thank you mrs diamantopoulou
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
wipo treaty
it is about artists entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products
it is about the wct world copyright treaty and the wppt world performance and phonograms treaty
without protection under intellectual property law creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed
forgeries are big business
it is estimated that in europe alone income of eur  billion is lost because of piracy
the problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry
there exists a special clause which requires parliament s assent in two cases
with regard to the present agreement both these conditions are fulfilled
a new institution is being created an assembly which in the future will monitor the agreement and its consequences
the agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the codecisionmaking procedure
parliament must therefore give its assent because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence
parliament cannot in any case at present do anything about the matter
the agreement complements the berne convention in regard to literary works
it creates international legal protection in connection with distribution sale rental public reproduction and the making available of works
it also creates protection for software and databases
there are problems regarding the term author 
for example it has not been defined
another issue which is somewhat problematic is that of intermediate storage
this too has not been solved
it is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition
that would not be a good thing
the question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved too
parliament cannot change these details
we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands
yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies
both myself as rapporteur and the committee think we ought to say yes
we have here an agreement which in spite of its defects constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright
i think they should have
a european patent is in the offing and that is a good thing
now the union and the member states are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law
it is good for us that we have the power to do this in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied
in that way we can act as a model for the applicant states
we have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement
finally i also want to thank this chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour
mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs cederschiold on her very serious work
she has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the world intellectual property organisation s treaties
the problem has been overcome
first there is the right of distribution as referred to in article 
to conclude i want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights
this ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of europe
cultural policy means in particular defending the role of the arts recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards
our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them
the entry into force of the treaties and their final form is however in addition to this recommendation dependent on implementation by the parties themselves
the eu too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the wipo
it is worrying that the position adopted by the previous parliament does not support this balanced wipo system
the recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in europe on the contrary
there is no consciously adopted position in the wipo treaty on temporary copies
the new operational environment is above all a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before
it is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account
parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation
 nl mr president i would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out
the commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively
this is important
it befits the commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur
i would like to stress the importance of both treaties
in addition assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the european union s role in terms of copyright
at international level there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly
these have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen wipo member states including the united states
this directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the wipo treaties
the european parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of article 
it is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world in the form of this recommendation
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
mr president i see in the minutes that two members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to strasbourg on monday
i would like to add that the flight from amsterdam s schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled
we were diverted to baselmulhouse airport
we were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival
in fact it took  minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport
we finally got here on monday at  pm after some of us had spent more than  hours travelling
this sort of service and difficulty in getting to strasbourg on a monday is quite hopeless
i wonder if that could be added to the minutes
i hope that next time also if any other airline company is involved things will run more smoothly
the minutes were approved
this item has been postponed until the next partsession in march
it was erroneously included in today s agenda
mr swoboda i can confirm what you have just said and there is in fact a printing error
the document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate
the smell is absolutely disgusting
can you please do something about it
coherence of eu policies with development
this endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace
we are all therefore dutybound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet
the consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development
a third aspect of this new model that i would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives
the concerted actions of the united nations institutions have played an important role here as has the bretton woods system
firstly we need to make the eu s development policy more effective
a second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for eu policy and the policies of the member states to complement each other more
as you know a council resolution was approved in june  under which the commission was required to present evaluation reports
but as you will also be aware we are waiting for a commission communication on coherence together with the communication on development policy
by this i mean of course the internal dynamics of the european union
the third aspect that needs to be considered is european union policy and member states policy
ladies and gentlemen the fourth and final aspect that i would like to draw to your attention regarding development policy is of course the development council there have been discussions especially in recent months about the role the development council could play in relation to eu policies
as you know there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other eu policies  you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the edf s financing or rather lack of financing
the views of the european parliament on this issue too will certainly be both timely and welcome
 let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the eu and acp countries
i would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations
i saw member states working as a team which was indeed a wonderful experience
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation
i shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement
we refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector
we decentralise administrative and in some cases financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development
after seattle i am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements
let me turn to some of the more important points
firstly the agreement on political issues
this is a real innovation both in the euacp context and in international relations in general
it is thus not confined to ec activities
this is a very important aspect taking into account the fundability of public finances
another new theme in the acpeu agreement is migration
we have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area
we also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration
this also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons
these very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance
we have met the concerns of the acp states as far as the timeframe of the trade negotiations is concerned
negotiations will start no later than 
a sixyear period is programmed for these negotiations
this approach will lead us to a fully wto compatible regime
economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their acp partners
in addition the agreements with the eu will act as an anchor
they will lock in the economic reforms just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties commitments under the agreements
as regards the volume of the next edf the eu has made its financial proposal
today about eur  billion of previous edf resources are uncommitted
this will enable the community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period
we are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity we are moving into a period of increased activity
such a commitment entails an indepth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides
turning to our development policy i would say that the global context has changed drastically
it is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves
the commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments procedures and institutional mechanisms
often policies are more determined by the instruments available than by policy objectives and clearlydefined priorities
human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage
this is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system
in order to face and solve these problems the community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with member states and parliament
the lack of concerted action among the  member states themselves and between them and the community also needs to be addressed
this is very much the line also just presented by minister amado
when we talk policies nowadays we engage in a process of convergence
this is part of the solution
everything has become more and more complex
this is also true of development cooperation
this should be done at member state level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for community action
this is where we want to go
it is vital to make community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework
it is this dual challenge that the commission has to take up by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement
we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested
mr president i would firstly like to thank mr amado and mr nielson
i am pleased that mr amado talked about the edf
mr president i thank mr nielson
we want to talk about coherence
this is the topic
this problem has been highlighted on several occasions to whit in  in  and 
the examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us
i have raised questions regarding this issue for years now
in fact the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the treaty of amsterdam in 
in  it was agreed that the european commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements
but what have we seen since then
fine words as is the case again today but no report it is too crazy for words really
it is therefore with good reason that we bring this up here today
i would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions
a number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production
in the union sugar is produced from sugar beet
the result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the union is significantly restricted
at the same time we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid
another example is cacao
this could just as well be   the internal market would still be harmonised
it seems to be heading this way nevertheless
what are we actually doing then
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what brussels actually does
it seems that european industry is more important here than our own principles our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries
there are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes
the inconsistency is astonishing
here too mr nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new lome convention
this is also at the request of the citizens
we have been saying this ourselves since back in  this is the topic of this debate
i hope the message strikes home and i really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures
the topic touches the very core of the european union
what are the objectives which each eu policy needs to take into account
every statutory article should of course not just be judged on its regularity but also on the importance of its contents
the interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government
we should not make reality out to be more rosetinted than it really is
reality is obstinate
it is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner without any backhandedness
what we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure
poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention
we are all acting as if this is not really happening but we all know that it is
it is not our task as meps to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand
the general interest of policy coherence is therefore a responsibility of the commission as a whole of the council and of the european parliament
what we need here is an integral approach
this is why we urge the commission in this sharp and clear resolution to develop specific instruments
we need to pinpoint and draw up an inventory of the problem areas for coherence
we need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved
mr president let us be clear from the outset when it comes to cooperation coherence is far from being the watchword
the first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the union and the member states on individual cooperation policies
and let us not forget that the de facto neocolonial policy of certain member states does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop
the second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes
the third area of incoherence is human rights
we say that we want to protect human rights
we encourage developing countries to respect human rights
we even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights
we ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns
nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations
we must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them
i will not even mention oil we are all aware of the policy of groups such as elf and total in africa
and yet and this is the sixth area of incoherence we do not defend the application of the current treaties
the eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature
we are always saying think globally act locally
and what about agriculture and the environment still more problems still more areas of incoherence which i might have highlighted not to mention research emigration or health
seattle was a failure and northsouth relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons
in the meantime however as has already been mentioned the negotiations on the future of the lome convention have been concluded
this goes to show just how topical this subject is
we could also add to the list the next euoau summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in cairo in april
it may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position but he did indeed say this and i heard it with my own ears
a new agreement has been reached with the acp countries
certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these
but it was above all the result of a stronger acp group which obviously found new courage following the events in seattle
lastly we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries
we cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrongheaded
mr president having listened to the council and the commission today i just had to look at my agenda
yes it does say coherence of different union policies with development policy 
but we have not heard a single word on this subject and i find that deeply embarrassing
we have been waiting for a report on coherence for years
european taxpayers contribute eur  billion per year in support of agriculture in the eu
add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for  of the developing countries gross national product compared with  in the eu
there is neither coherence nor human decency here
why will neither the council nor the commission admit the fact
mr president how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental
is the council discussing this issue
how decisions are made is allimportant
however the council statement gave me hope for the future
i will give some examples shortly
some of these issues have been discussed in depth
remember too some countries blocked an agreement with south african trade for four years
there is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment
i wish the commission well in its task of producing that basic document
mr president this morning s debate is very important
in today s globalised world this fact is all the more obvious
there are no boundaries for community policies
both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied
the commission is addressing a very important area that is commercial policy
but we who sit here in parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is
i should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of in my view useful figures
and there is no sign of this trend s being reversed
these figures are from before the internet revolution took off
in a global village major discrepancies in the world will not in the longer term be tolerated by the poorest section of the village
at some time or another there will be a revolt and it will be fully justified
the eu on average is far from providing the pledged 
it may well be that others are worse but that does not place us in any better a light
above all however we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us
i shall conclude with a few words about the internet revolution
as commissioner liikanen keeps saying on his travels we have a head start here in europe in the area of mobile telecommunications
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries
mr president the eu s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired 
this is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week commenting on the union s development policy
this is not new
hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror
why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the european policy s internal conflict
in terms of trade and agriculture in particular the european policy is in conflict with the development policy
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries
this has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the union regarding development cooperation
i advocate transparent joint and efficient development policy
mr president commissioner i believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense
so there is a whole raft of contradictions
we have to be aware of this
we obviously know that even within any one country there are always contradictions between various policies
that is a fact of life
this monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction
i have left to the end a question that i regard as fundamental and which i think needs to be noted and approved by this house
that is why i consider it to be essential  and fair  for these principles to be established at the next wto round
take the fishing agreements where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the eu waters
take the trade agreements
in other words when eu commercial interests are concerned poverty considerations go out of the window
today beef stocks stand at   tonnes
who will be next quite literally for the chop
action simply has not been taken
i ask mr nielson in his summingup to directly address those points in the resolution
mr president i would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture
the results are certainly not what we expected
what could be the cause of this
i think that the commission could do a great deal there to help this develop
no farmer anywhere in the world will produce something if prices are too low
it should not be the case that the policy of the member states contravenes that of the commission
special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production
far too often artificial fertiliser veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge
once the project comes to an end after five years the policy of free gifts also ends
finally i wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use
the presidentinoffice of the council came up with a good suggestion namely to budget the european development fund
parliament would of course welcome this with open arms if this were possible it would be a huge historic victory
since amsterdam three terms have taken centre stage complementarity coordination and cohesion
i believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields
one thing shocked me in the speech of the presidentinoffice of the council
he stated contradictions in policy can lead to balance
it is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand and vice versa
this is supposed to be our priority would you believe
i know that we do a great deal of good but let us start with this very essential aspect
the first is concerned with conflict resolution
the un has a peace plan
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in africa to an end
i also want to take up the subject of migration
i really also want to see the eu pioneer patents on living organisms
we now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds
three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests
i also want to see something about women in the report i hope the commission will produce
the level of aid is naturally important and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased
this ought to be done with in particular a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity
however the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries
the latter include trade agricultural and fisheries policies
in this economy the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked
i cannot help but wonder why the commission has not done more
i can only hope that mr nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the commission
in addition to a report of this kind i should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character
it should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting
i believe it is only a coincidence but the commissioner for the environment is also of course to participate in this group
let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed
policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other
there are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest
it did not work poverty became worse than ever
is that not the lesson of the european union itself and of the single market in particular
as mr nielson said this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity
yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough
we also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries parliament s resolution on the wto negotiations advocated a free import policy by the eu
the member states have spent similar amounts
mr nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with member states
this has been talked about for years
mr president commissioner nielson the conclusion of the new acpeu convention is an important step towards greater coherence
for these are prerequisite to any development
if these criteria are not adhered to then development does not stand a chance
the same goes for cuba mr modrow
i welcome the fact that cuba is getting closer to joining this process but for this to happen there are also going to have to be a few changes in cuba
after all we are all familiar with the reports from amnesty international
nonetheless these are important criteria for the european union
there is a second issue i would like to raise
we are discussing coherence here
many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent
in my view however the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too
this to my mind is also something that we should call upon the intergovernmental conference to do ie establish the edf firmly in the budget of the european union
in our view cooperation is and should remain an intergovernmental exercise
why should we add to them
and let me say in passing it is even more astonishing that the council allowed it to
finally a word on the general thinking behind the corrie report
it was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened
 pt mr president by way of both a conclusion and a summary i would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate
 i sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate
i have given you a statement on behalf of the commission which i think provides a useful background to this discussion
we will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence
this discussion is not new
i have read  and heard in the debate  that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything
i would however warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system
this exists but it is only a small part of what we are discussing
mr mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low
this is true in our part of the world but our partners and beneficiaries in africa have a slightly different perspective
they farm not just for a living but in order to live and this makes a difference
from that perspective what i am saying here is of deep relevance
other issues have been mentioned cattlefarming in namibia tomatoes and milk powder in the caribbean
we should not be too masochistic
there is a limit to how useful that is
all these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of
these are real problems but they have all been dealt with
this is not a clear case of incoherence it is more a case of a competition between suppliers
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the caribbean is more complicated
finally i thank you again for this debate
thank you very much commissioner nielson
i have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  pm
next session of un human rights commission
in particular there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty
this draft resolution was defeated by a chinese noaction motion
the european union voted against that motion
it is by no means certain that the european union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote
the presidency will also present to the chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern
lastly during the next human rights commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the commission itself
that is easier said than done  we are still discussing some of the toughest issues
it is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult
however let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues the death penalty cuba and china
i am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks
this has always been a subject about which i personally have felt extremely strongly i have always voted against the death penalty
we know what happened recently at the un general assembly
the new york stage is different from geneva
it certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty
the debate in geneva however is more focused on human rights issues
we may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there
secondly cuba
we are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions
we have regularly put our criticisms to the cuban authorities and this parliament has done the same
but i do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate cuba
we want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
my views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which i wish to deal namely china
quite simply i want us to be engaged with china
so what should we do
so what should be our attitude towards a geneva resolution this year
as the presidency has noted the union as a whole is considering its position
but i strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the member states ought to take proper account
that is a point that deserves serious consideration
chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in tibet
we have made our views very clear to them
that is very welcome and i also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level
the next dialogue in lisbon on  february will be an important test
it will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not
what finally do we want to see as the first steps
i wish we were closer to that
where does all that leave us this year
i repeat that member states will have to make up their minds
that in my judgement is the challenge for the next few weeks
i am grateful to the house for its concern about human rights around the world and particularly in china
thank you very much commissioner patten
we will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the un human rights commission and proceed to the vote
welcome
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the hong kong legislative council to parliament
loud applause
vote
 as mrs wallstrom explained during yesterday s debate the commission is able to accept the following amendments amendments nos        and 
the commission can also accept amendment no  in principle
the commission cannot accept amendments nos       and 
the president declared the common position approved as amended
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
before the final vote
 i regret to say that i believe that the thoughtout position i advanced yesterday is the correct position
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this
mr president in accordance with article   i call for referral back to committee
the reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure as proposed by the commission
we take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time but the commission will not adopt this
parliament decided to refer the report back to committee
before the vote
applause from the left heckling from the right
as a political force we serve to guarantee that austria will continue to embrace european values
i refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons
this does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda
i utterly reject this
loud sustained applause from the centre and from the right protests from the left
welcome
it is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the maghreb countries will be visiting morocco on  to  march
i hope the delegation has an excellent visit to strasbourg
loud applause
vote continuation
in particular the commission can accept in full amendments nos                        and 
the commission can accept in part amendments nos              and 
the commission can accept in principle amendments nos                                  and 
but the commission cannot accept amendments nos                               rev    and 
thank you for your attention
the president declared the common position approved as amended
parliament adopted the resolutionpresident
that concludes the vote
explanations of vote lienemann report a
 fr i welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on life
as far as the third phase of life  is concerned the instrument is to be divided into three sections lifenature  of the resources lifeenvironment  and lifethird countries 
in my opinion the most important amendments concern the following
the contribution that the projects supported by life make to the sustainability of social and economic activities and thus job creation
i consider it crucial that the life instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern europe
the other candidate countries eg cyprus turkey malta my also take part in life when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries
i support mrs lienemann s firm stance
this type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions
boge report a
these rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie
the european parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard
it is up to us as responsible europeans to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive
cederschiold report a
in my view products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products namely those that can be seen and touched
we are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation
in institutional terms there has been no clarification of what role the ep is to play in the further development of the wipo treaties
in addition there is a clear tendency in matters of international jurisdiction more and more often to obtain a pure eu jurisdiction
moreover the concept of author is not defined in the treaties
graefe zu baringdorf a
 pt food safety issues are in the spotlight following the bse and dioxin scandals
gmos are still the subject of great uncertainty both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health
the precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty
the profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises
this will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer s freedom of choice
stenzel report a
mr president i would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the ppe group on the equal report
this is why we are abstaining
it is regrettable that due to the procedure the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session
i am convinced that the rapporteur s nationality has played a certain role which should not be of relevance in this parliament
this is actually in conflict with european values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this parliament
these were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report
we want equal to go ahead
the time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice
 da we have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the commission concerning the guidelines for eu initiative programmes cip
we think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report
nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague all too pie in the sky

the lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on
equal stands for equality 
it must be seen to deliver
there must be flexibility
i deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative
in the last programming period  of structural funds were available for community initiatives
the figure is now 
this often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities
the positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process
i also stressed the need for prevention
the involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted
there must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority
there must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets

this is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations
the commission did not do that
we hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned
opinion of an mep from the south of europe nevertheless this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions
end of fiction
once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union

a simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source
but the source is threatening to run dry
scientific studies are now no more than a formality water will be the main resource at stake in years to come starting tomorrow
but tomorrow will be too late
we have to lay down the rules of play today before we all lose
we have thrown water a lifebelt
 fr it is with the greatest satisfaction that i welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy
specific directives will then be adopted within this framework
the procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy
the proposal for a directive was amended twice first in  and then in 
however the committee on the environment has tabled numerous amendments most of which i support
all the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within  years not 
i must say that i support these reduced deadlines especially as provision is made for derogations
there is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur
however the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which under the rules of subsidiarity should be left to the member states for decision
in my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common european charge for this issue
in ireland all the major users of water commercial industrial and agricultural already pay for their use of water
these are the main reasons for my vote
i support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy
however i do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used
water in this context is a commercial commodity
we all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved
 fr we are disappointed by the council s common position on this proposal for a framework directive
however the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the european union wishes to pursue with this text
the objective is of course to create first and foremost a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified
however the union should be seeking beyond that to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater
from this point of view the common position is weak
i should like to see our parliament defend a more ambitious position than the council s position but i should also like that position to be equally credible
the zero input and zero pollution requirement including for substances naturally present in water is not realistic
on the contrary i object to this systematically applied strategy
it damages parliament
our messages to our citizens and to the council are muddled and lack credibility
overly strict unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable
is that the message we want to send out

however apart from these principles there is the consideration that water as a common resource cannot be subjected to the rules of the market
in fact water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market
this means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water
the timetable set in the report of  is unrealistic and impracticable but the timetable set by the council of  is too far in the distance
we believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date
we have voted against amendments nos  and  which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater
the foregoing is the reason for our vote

fr water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed
the framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of community policy in this area
it has clear ambitious objectives
we share them
it sets environmental parameters close to zero
we need a timetable by all means but a more gradual timetable
such provisions may well cause serious problems in crossborder areas and in candidate countries thereby complicating enlargement
andersson report a
for example it is acknowledged on page  of the explanatory statement that the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the member states make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the member states social security systems 
noone would benefit from this type of harmonisation 
finally paragraph  emphasises that the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination  and in this regard we approach the heart of the matter
i hope that parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now
the report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but rather better use of available resources
noone would benefit from this situation
the policies of the european union also have much to answer for in this situation
of course we need to modernise these systems
in france in particular we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions
we also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices chaos and waste
social protection should be an expression first and foremost of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost exclusively in fact under the jurisdiction of the nation state
social protection should be based on the principle of national and community preferences
otherwise it is merely the financial processing at the expense and to the detriment of european citizens of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration

we are basically well disposed towards the european union
in these areas europe s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity
all other questions ought to be dealt with at local regional or national levels
each member state ought to have full responsibility for and the right autonomously to decide upon its social security systems
the same applies to labour market policy
we do not believe that common european legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security
that does not however prevent the member states from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere
we wholeheartedly support at national level many of the ideas presented in mr andersson s report
we therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions
there are three main aspects that need to be highlighted
the second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them
nowadays it is becoming more commonplace as well as efficient to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes
the third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the european union
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity it is the member states themselves which devise their own social security systems
the report seeks effective and ambitious fiscal coordination  without going on to define more specifically what this means
we are therefore voting against paragraph  of the report
the report emphasises the social dimension of european cooperation which is something to be welcomed
it is nonetheless important to clarify what role the eu is to play and not to play with regard to social security
clarification of this kind is missing from the report which is unfortunate
it is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems
that concludes the explanations of vote
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
next session of un human rights commission continuation
in order to make our actions effective we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present
i believe that this should be applied to all areas in particular also the budgetary area
the union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work
the role of parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on particularly at the level of prevention
in that sense we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law
it seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed
we have often employed instruments which at the formal level make us feel comfortable but which in terms of practical results are totally ineffectual
in particular we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded
globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process
that is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments even if it goes against their interests
it is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in geneva
the rhetoric that we use however often smacks of smugness verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in north america
i fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction towards european exclusiveness and apartheid
we have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in geneva
as mr patten said and i would like to thank him for the positions which he defended the crucial point is china
there is regression in every sector of chinese civil society
china likes doublespeak
until we have a firm position we will achieve nothing with the chinese authorities
i think we need to seize the opportunity
we need to associate ourselves with the american initiative
we need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted
we need to work
mr president i would like to try to put a different perspective to this
beyond the milky way there are  billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets
it is probable therefore that there is a lot of life out there and much of it much more advanced than we are
what do they see
they see a beautiful planet teeming with life but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up
they see forests being cut down and deserts spreading
of the living creatures they can see many animals that are treated cruelly rare ones becoming extinct for ever
how do they see the currently dominant species  that is us
well they see the planet s resources being unevenly spread
what do they see about the relationships between human beings
they see us killing each other
they see us restricting each other s liberties
we all know the picture
the un convention on human rights  years ago was an attempt to correct this
we should salute it  and i think we do
only in europe are human rights enforceable in law
i say shame on them
human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world
that is the goal which we have to work towards
much as commissioner patten said remains to be done
mr president human rights are universal indivisible interrelated and interwoven
that is positive
but what about the human rights policy within the eu itself
does it reflect this vision of coherence
in fact does the european union have a human rights policy
such policy should comprise various components
firstly a regulatory framework is needed which spells out very clearly the rights which the eu intends to secure for its citizens
this is a political question which in the short term requires an answer from the igc and this parliament
the commission and the council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be
mr president this parliament is fragmented and divided
i think that this will benefit our credibility in the un human rights committee
i do not know if he is still present and can hear me
mr president the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the th century
the holocaust fifty years ago led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms
since the end of the cold war compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation
especially in situations of war civilians are given less consideration all the time
it seems contradictory
never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed
never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries
women are systematically raped
children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle
excesses are no longer the exception they have unfortunately become the rule
this applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide
first of all the policy comes too late
fifty years later we are still unable to prevent genocide
we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency
control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this
the human rights policy is also too selective
the impression that africans get namely that they are inferior world citizens is not unfounded
but above all the human rights policy is too fragmented
we are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or europe
take sudan
the international community is sending conflicting messages to this country
britain has reopened its embassy in khartoum
canada has invited the sudanese for peace talks
there is a need for more coordination more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided
only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the universal declaration of human rights
yet words spoken written or signed are not in themselves enough
the defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination
even within the eu citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions
quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created
we must not waiver in that commitment
but we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies
yes conventions have been signed but action is needed
what happens in another part of the world affects us
pinochet in chile is as relevant as haider in austria
human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked
mr president europe stands for ideals values and principles
we must emphasise europe s spiritual history
together we must reestablish the values which unite europe
spiritual values have been disseminated from europe throughout the globe
we must live with our consciences
these were the words spoken three hours ago in this chamber by the president of the czech republic vaclav havel
we should be grateful that there are heads of state like vaclav havel in our europe
i wish to discuss two matters
first of all civil society
the same is happening in china in connection with the falun gong movement and with the catholic and protestant churches
it is happening with buddhism in tibet
we must never forget to defend civil society
i also want to mention the death penalty
on the basis of this principle human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves
try telling that to the governments of the united states russia and china
the european union and its member states should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds
it is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy
the first country is indonesia
we are also pleased that the situation in timor is slowly moving in the right direction
but i can report that in the moluccas an area just north of timor the violence is still not under control
this has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years
tens of thousands of people are on the run
the situation is badly managed
surely thousands of people killed thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough
my second country  i will be brief as mr patten knows this country very well  is burma
surely we cannot just keep silent about burma
i have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion
for ten years now the elected president of that country has been under house arrest
and for ten years now its parliament has been out of action
numerous mps have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in burma
in my opinion burma should be put back on the agenda too certainly in the wake of indonesia s uturn
surely we cannot tolerate the fact that mrs aung san sui kyi feels completely left in the lurch even by europe
my request is in fact to put this country back on the top of the agenda
justice needs to be done in indonesia
justice needs to be done in east timor
president wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with
the specific reference in this resolution to east timor on the initiative of the ppe group is a timely one
this is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency

for all these reasons i thought it essential to reply directly to mr van hecke s question on this issue
 mr president this has been a very useful debate
one or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully
what i would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate
one of the very first speakers mr wuori spoke of the remarks made earlier today by mr havel
how do we implement what the treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes
one or two honourable members mr ferber and mr cushnahan spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality
mr cashman said which is right in a sense that words are no substitute for real action
of course words can make a bit of a difference a point that was made by mrs malmstrom
i think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the chinese authorities
it has been a useful debate
i hope we can have further debates like this
i have received  motions for resolution pursuant to rule  to close the present statement
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday
cyprus and malta
the next item is the joint debate on
the council statement on the position of the european union on developments concerning cyprus
mr seixas da costa has the floor on behalf of the council
these negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the un special representative alvaro de soto
this is the position of the secretarygeneral of the united nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis
this will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for  april
this is key as regards the future of this issue
it is essential for us to send the commission a message of confidence about its role in this area
we believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome
in particular we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue
mr president we have listened to the statements by the council and the commission and i would like to make the following observations
for example i would not refer to the government of nicosia
it is the cypriot government mr presidentinoffice not the government of nicosia
i cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies
as the commissioner said and i agree with him it is a matter of political decision
i would be grateful if the commissioner could explicitly confirm that
in other words accession should not be held hostage to a political solution
the two processes are separate processes
this unequivocal position on the part of the european parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy
the presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever
however i also think that we in the eu should be making a constructive contribution
i also think  as has already been mentioned  that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements which we must solve
there is of course the question of preaccession aid and this belongs in category seven
resources should therefore be set aside from category seven where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out
this is the crux of the matter
it is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full
but we are also convinced that despite improved relations between the turkish and greek populations it is not enough
cyprus should be one sovereign state with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised
the international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force
the solution to the cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to cyprus s accession to the union as mr poos has reminded us
the big question however is from what budget heading should this aid be financed
the council and commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 
this is in line with the budget order issued by parliament in december last
the rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing cyprus and malta under category 
this is an extremely risky strategy
in fact the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in parliament
cyprus and malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the council and parliament regarding the height of the ceilings
moreover what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action
i would therefore advocate that the eur  million in category  be dropped in line with the commission s proposal
i hope that the decisions taken at helsinki lead to progress on the cyprus issue
i hope this signals a new era of hope for cyprus
i hope that turkey begins to play a constructive role in the cyprus issue
i welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the greek government and the turkish government
i hope that has an encouraging effect on the cyprus talks
rather the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me
this applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect
as far as the citizens are concerned it is what a regulation can do for them that matters
we will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned
it is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs which is no way to set a shining example
the quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria is it decentralised is it transparent is it accessible to the citizens and does it work
nonetheless as far as the divided island of cyprus is concerned overall this preaccession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge
i must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the european parliament that is so important to me in this respect
both the commission and the council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well
i am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect
i believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in cyprus before admitting this country to the european union
regardless of the national origin of each cypriot the future of the cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country
even in this chamber the council s representative referred to the north of cyprus and not to the occupied territories
on their course towards accession the people of cyprus have already lost a great deal but stand to lose even more
i just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity
mr alyssandrakis was translated as saying the confederate solution would be best 
obviously he said the federal solution would be best 
it is a most important point and needs to be clarified mr president
thank you very much for the clarification mr wurtz
mr president malta and cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland europe
the maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments
their success has relied in great part on their enterprise their dynamism and their flexibility
the eu should leave cyprus and malta alone
this means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the cyprus problem
helsinki was an historic event an historic turningpoint and an historic new reference point
conditions are ripe
in any event the outcome is in your hands
the outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions to the extent that we are providing you with options
i hope there has been an interpretation error and that he will clarify the matter in his followup speech
decisions have been taken by the council with a great sense of responsibility
we believe that helsinki was very clear in this respect
there is no point in secondguessing or trying to secondguess our intentions
however i would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested
malta cyprus and turkey were not provided for at this stage
mrs schroedter described this as a lack of coherence
i have had a little to do with this too
hitherto this has been out of the question of course
if we do this then heading  would be increased accordingly but heading  would be decreased by the same amount
the idea that heading  could be added to in this way and heading  left alone is not workable
the commission and the council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in cyprus to undertake joint projects
so far as you know this has proved unsuccessful and i have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary
i do not have confirmation of this at present and nor do i expect it since we have not yet held direct talks
these will take place at a later date
there would then be no question of cyprus acceding to the union
therefore it is my firm belief that since helsinki there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict
indeed that was the idea behind it
finally of course the cyprus question has a role in the discussions with turkey
that is what we intend to do the necessary measures and programmes are in place
i must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation the one that has yet to be decided on here before we can even get started
the financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with malta and cyprus
i cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place because i lack the legal basis for doing so
 pt mr president i am sure that the issue raised by my friend elmar brok will be considered by the council
i feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate
mr presidentinoffice of the council as i understood it mr brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still
mr president i asked commissioner verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument meda but he has not provided an answer
i would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us
forgive me mr poos
this is how matters stand with regard to meda malta and cyprus can take part in the national programmes but not in the countryspecific ones because the incomes are too high
thank you very much commissioner verheugen
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday
question time council
question no  by h
the council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field
there is a directive dating from  on this subject
there are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting community ports
i am pleased that the council is considering this question
the president of the council comes from a country portugal which is directly at risk from just this type of situation
of course the story of the erika seems comical
the ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port
this kind of situation should not be allowed
the damage to your country mr president and to mine spain could be horrendous
however we have to work within the existing legislative framework
in this area we have to work with the world as it is and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation
the commission s intentions in this area are positive as it intends to reinforce the application of the  directive
mr president in kotka in finland there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals which is sailing under a flag of convenience
 pt mrs korhola as you will understand i do not at the moment have the information i need to give you a concrete reply
the information that i have is to do with the  directive which does not include any provisions of that kind
question no  by h
even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped
mr president mrs karamanou s question is an extremely serious one and i would not wish to conceal that fact
i think it is well known that the european union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community
mrs karamanou i recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in kosovo in this field have not been enough
i do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that
we have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community
this is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole
i would like to widen the debate and include the situation in mitrovica
this means that medical aid is still denied to the albanian kosovars
but where will you place the emphasis
what will you do to ensure that albanian kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital including that in mitrovica
mr staes the situation in mitrovica is well known
i perfectly understand mr staes s concerns
i believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible because there are various protagonists involved
question no  by h
is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed
mr president mr alavanos question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues
i am aware that there may be different views about nato s action and the legitimacy of that action
everyone is free to hold such views
in my own country the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter
that was how it was
this objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the general affairs council in luxembourg on  april
this compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted
any other information will of course be analysed by the prosecutor who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action
until that time prosecutor del ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against nato
if the presidentinoffice has noticed almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to kosovo
the duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as secretarygeneral of nato
mr president i believe mr alavanos is getting nato and mr milosevic mixed up
mr milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding nato the sakharov prize
but i have a quite different question for the council
how do matters stand in kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration the judiciary and most importantly of all the police force
you mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done
rapid action is called for
as you know the first steps were taken some months ago
so we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets
question no  by h
has the time come for the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia
mr president i would like to thank the representative of the council presidency for his answer
our relationship with armenia as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year is of course one element in these foreign relations
question no  by h
during the last few days we have seen serbs murdered by kosovar albanian mafiatype groups also with impunity
we are therefore all to blame
i would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context
mr president i am no friend of milosevic or his government
the current situation in kosovo which is now ethnically cleansed of serbs and roma speaks for itself
the division of yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way
mr president i was a little disappointed with the answer given by the presidentinoffice to my colleague
if civilian targets were targeted and destroyed killing civilians is illegal by anyone s standards
it should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the milosevic regime
that however is not my question
my question is about political prisoners held in serbia now
there are i believe around   kosovar political prisoners held in serbia at the moment
my question to the presidentinoffice is twofold
firstly is the council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners
secondly what does it propose to do about them
mr maccormick first of all i would like to answer your comments
i did not defend attacks on civilians
as i said we are not making value judgements about specific actions
question no  by h
what are the council s views on the substance of the charter what type of rights will the charter set out economic social and cultural
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes
what are the council s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union
i thank the presidentinoffice for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work
as i said mrs kratsatsagaropoulou we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights
this matter should form part of the charter of fundamental rights
this will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the charter of fundamental rights
furthermore we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue
i do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not
i therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief
otherwise we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the charter of fundamental rights
mr rubig has the floor
both parties were once part of the government
so far there have been no infringements of the law
are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the charter of human rights
would a right of veto on the part of the presidentinoffice of the council in respect of the formation of national governments be reconcilable with the charter of fundamental rights
is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the charter of fundamental rights
what i would like to know is what will happen to the draft charter that the convention draws up
will the council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands or will the council feel free to amend that document
will the council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft charter
 pt the answer is neither yes nor no
i do not know mr martin it will depend on the decision taken by the council
question no  by h
these can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects
will the eu take the lead in advancing this process
what is the council s view of the involvement of european governments and companies in this project
i wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by eu companies in the eu applicant countries
i ask this because of the issue of coherence the subject of this morning s discussion
 pt mrs lucas i was not present at the debate you are referring to
question no  by h
what kind of measures does the council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the european institutions in similar cases
this is indeed also stipulated in article 
the court of auditors therefore already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the european union is approved by common agreement between the council and this parliament
the council therefore has no means of changing the role conferred on the court of auditors by the treaty
for years the council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes
i would ask you now that you are president of the council will you push forward with this extremely important proposal
it is extremely important
their reports are extremely detailed and very important
this is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future
 pt mrs mckenna a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the commission
the commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions
i do not think that i can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted
question no  by h
one of the matters to be settled is whether members are to receive equal pay and where they are to pay tax
will the portuguese presidency clarify its position on this matter
we are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter
this has from the outset been the position of the portuguese presidency
is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians
that is my first question
we are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations
this has an impact of course because it is read by other members of the council
i am therefore perfectly aware of this problem
how do you think a system like that would affect people s confidence in ourselves as politicians
however if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy go ahead
 mr president i have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy
i would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the council
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
address by mr vaclav havel president of the czech republic
i should also like to welcome mrs havel who is sitting in the gallery
you are most welcome
applause
this is not your first visit to our parliament mr president
an association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the european parliament and the czech parliament
your country filed an official application to join the union in  and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 
the process of european integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain
the end of this artificial separation of europe marked the start of a new era
we now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of europe
mr president you are a symbol of these changes
but you never lost hope and history proved you right
ten years ago the velvet revolution proclaimed havel na hrad
for ten years you represented democratic czechoslovakia and later the czech republic as its president
reconciliation with your neighbours was and still is a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance
you are a first class european
today the czech republic is preparing to join our union
the european union for its part will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement
it has already taken a big step forward with agenda 
mr president it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor
applause
thank you you are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a european identity
i have taken note of your words this is something which we all feel very deeply
we find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you which have always guided your actions your attachment to fundamental values
we of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you
thank you mr president
the formal sitting was closed at  pm
acpeu joint assembly
 rapporteur mr president i had hoped to be rising at  am not  pm to present this report
in many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one
the acpeu joint assembly is a unique organisation in world politics
where else do  nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern
the strasbourg assembly was the last chaired by lord plumb
i pay special tribute to him for his success
the main thrust of our work in both assemblies was poverty eradication
the resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights
we had as usual many debates on countries where there are war situations
i visited ethiopia and eritrea to gain firsthand knowledge
the oau is doing its best to broker a peace deal there
but ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious
in nassau we had two interesting debates on east timor and cuba
cuba has observer status but i understand has now shown a wish to join the acp
i await with interest developments in cuba
we must give them all our support to reach that goal
this i think is the new convention
secondly the new convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions which would allow us to be much more specific in our work
these assemblies would report back to the joint assembly
we had a regional debate in nassau in the caribbean and this was extremely productive
we are going to have one in abuja in west africa too
i want to see civil society given a louder voice
but to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this headon
we must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance
i am delighted to see the result in zimbabwe
european taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used
a new wind of change must blow through africa and new standards must be set and lived up to
i beg to move acceptance of this report
mr president let me begin by congratulating mr corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report
one way forward to promote the setting up of smes could be to train the nigerian population adequately
thank you mr zimmerling if i am informed correctly this is the first time you are addressing this house
congratulations on your maiden speech it went really well
so i do not want to look back only to the year 
the rapporteur mr corrie has already done so most expertly
they also had strong repercussions in the developing countries
the aftershocks can still be felt
acp cooperation is a dynamic process
the content of the agreements has progressed steadily between lome i and lome vi
at the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably now standing at 
so acp cooperation remains very exciting and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new convention
that also means strengthening the democratic institutions
the history of the joint assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction
we ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches  in the near future which is indeed what the new convention is aiming at
one special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the acp states is regional cooperation and integration
but i am a little sad that the european development fund has still not been incorporated in the community budget
i hope it does not take another  years before we finally achieve that too
mr president i congratulate mr corrie on his report
the lome convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the eu and the acp countries for over  years
we need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the acp are pursued in their own right
that reflects the growth of inequality between eu and acp countries
the aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes and the poor majority does not benefit at all
after all who protects these deeply corrupt regimes if not the governments of the rich countries
in this speech i will confine myself to addressing certain points i consider fundamental
that is important for at least three reasons
secondly we must bear in mind that cuba s application has the support of all the acp countries
the acpeu joint assembly meets again in a few weeks time and i am sure this subject will be dealt with there
of course cuba must meet all the standard conditions just like any other member
the cubans know that and i am sure they accept it
it must also be made clear that cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners
cuba s wish to join is welcome and cuba will be welcome in our circle
i do not have very long in which to speak and i really only want to take up two questions
we must put a stop to this trend
we must begin by writing off debts we must follow up words with action
i should like us to take a leading role in this work
the acp countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion
i think that is a very good idea indeed and i fully subscribe to it
however we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements
how do these operate within the european parliament s delegation to the acpeu s joint assembly
in this context account ought to be taken of the smaller groups and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements
the challenge was immense
we have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events
what right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own
in short this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves the proof of success
these regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas
consistency and action are needed
the participation of local bodies is absolutely essential
we need to make progress with concrete and consistent action
people in the poor countries are beginning to despair
in order to be able to develop the countries concerned must however become actively involved in the global economic system
mrs lucas mentioned that the stabex and sysmin system ought to be continued with
i do not agree
that system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is in actual fact of use only to relatively few of the  countries concerned
it is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door
once they have done so we shall adopt a position on the matter
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty
finally i would refer to the south africa agreement which the rapporteur also touched upon
so the grappa war is over
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
stabilisation and association agreement with fyrom
for it is no small thing to have a minority of  or even  in one s own country
the commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the council
firstly there is the regional approach
i believe that if it is understood properly the regional approach is both important and necessary
there has to be a willingness to cooperate
on the other hand cooperation with bulgaria and in particular with greece has made good progress and i think we should acknowledge that too
as i said it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition
fyrom wants to be told here and now that in principle accession will be possible when the time is right
this country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined
i think commissioner patten understands that too
so i very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks
thirdly i believe that so far at least fyrom has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly
it was in fact in macedonia that i heard at the time about the roma population actually not having too bad a time there
i was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the roma in europe
with regard to the problems afflicting macedonia higher education for the albanianspeaking citizens deserves our special attention
i might never have studied otherwise
it would be beneficial if we could reorganise this especially visavis the neighbouring states
it is only fair that we should regulate aid to macedonia properly now
i would quote the phare programme as an example
mr president the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the greek sensitivities surrounding it
if certain countries wish to use the words former yugoslavia  then that is their business others need not feel obliged to copy them
it will not do to keep us under constant pressure
mr president let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of mr swoboda s work as rapporteur
and there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive
with this in mind we have presented some amendments which i hope parliament will accept
mr president commissioner we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace stability and prosperity in southeast europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wideranging problems we are trying to eliminate
mr president commissioner the war in kosovo has knocked everything off balance
this is certainly true for the relations between the european union and the western balkans
since then expectations have been high
this applies to them and us
is there any prospect of membership
this is very much on their minds
but here too within the european union expectations are high
if we do things properly this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy
will the union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy for the first time concerning such a difficult regulation
can we based on the experiences in macedonia and in four other countries improve on this
this is not the union s only contribution
the debate on the stability pact the debate on the cara programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending
we are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements that is to say a mediumterm issue
this is why i think that this first agreement with macedonia is so crucial because it serves as a model
i am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen
what does the european union intend to do with macedonia
will it do the same to us
this first step is so important because of this model function
macedonia also serves as a model for another reason
the rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms namely the issue of interethnic relations
there is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture
we would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western balkans with the help of the macedonians
this model function also applies to regional cooperation
mr president commissioner if we manage this first step successfully we will have gained a great deal
if we mess it up then we will have lost a great deal more
i am referring to the sanctions against yugoslavia
do not misunderstand me i too believe that we need to take effective action against the milosevic regime
the assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions
they have suffered enough first under the soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc
the various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context
this agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region
that is why it is so important
the point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the european union to draw closer to these countries
mr president commissioner i am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow members
i think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy
paragraph  holds up this agreement as an example
paragraph  indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status
a few days ago mr racan announced that croatia s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 
after nearly  years greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name and i hope the interpreters have not used the term fyrom when i have been saying macedonia
it is absolutely absurd apart from anything else it is offensive in my opinion to the greek meps and the citizens of greece
this question needs to be resolved urgently
why has the council not informed us of this
why has the commission not informed us of this formal request from macedonia
mr president commissioner the balkans are not purely a dark cave politically speaking
the decidedly positive developments in the republic of macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves
the gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring kosovo did not reach its territory
mr swoboda s wellbalanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level
mr president as one who has been concerned with macedonia for eight years i have to contradict mr dupuis
what we are doing here is not hypocritical
we have reached a propitious moment and i think the macedonians are glad about it
please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything
i think we should take a more positive approach here
macedonia did not go through a war
it suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the kosovo war
i think mr swoboda has drafted an excellent report and it has my wholehearted support
mr president i too would like to compliment mr swoboda on his report
i think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it
this marks the beginning of the treatybased stabilising process for the countries of the former yugoslavia
these countries do not yet qualify for a preaccession agreement
the present agreement is a kind of prepreagreement but with a view to joining in future
macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match
it does however have the ambition to break free from this image
this requires internal stability
more than anything the country needs peace and quiet now in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity
we the social democrats would urge the opposition to back these ideas
they need to help support the muchpraised macedonian model
but the country also  and especially  needs external stability
what is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable
this stability is required in the relations with yugoslavia kosovo albania and bulgaria
the region should recognise that macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist
external stability also means open borders and regional cooperation
minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange
macedonia s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries
the kosovo problem is wellknown and the international community is present there on a massive scale
it seems that the albania factor is being underestimated
the union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country
but what then instead
what does the commission intend to do regarding this issue
yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and as such a threat to macedonia s stability
we need to wait and see what happens there
the mood in belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day
we however second the council s decision to give the sanctions a different focus
in this way at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations a shot in the arm
what else will the union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition  bringing forward elections  is met
what else can we do to support this opposition
when the usa and nato and finally also the eu reacted it was already late in fact very late
a great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the eu among others has acted earlier and more decisively
we the european union therefore have a special responsibility to help support and rebuild the balkans now
we liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly just as paolo costa reported
we should do exactly the same for the other countries in the balkans
this is an urgent duty for the eu
the man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the hague still goes free
i am talking about milosevic
mr president the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the stability pact in southeastern europe
all this in exchange for the promise of future accession to the european union
the report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the european union on southeastern europe
for about  years the situation in the area has been fluid
both as an historical period and in particular as a political period  years is a very long time
under those conditions then there has been a real failure
in essence fyrom is a miniature version of the former yugoslavia regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy
we must choose those which are moderate which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area
i say this just so that we know where we stand
 this has been a very interesting general debate about the balkans as a whole
i am delighted to be able to be able to set out the commission s position on the report
it is very helpful
it is an excellent contribution by mr swoboda and his colleagues
i am very pleased that at our overall relations with fyrom are in such a good state
perhaps mr dupuis will forgive me for using that expression  both he and his interpreter  in the spirit of entente cordiale
that has been helped by our excellent european union representative in the country
he has been a great friend to parliament and a great servant of the commission
the imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations
so to is the cooperation of fyrom in the rebuilding of kosovo
let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives
they cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with fyrom
we are now making in the commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in march
i am due to visit fyrom in the second week in march
i hope to be able to set the process in motion then although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter
at the time of that visit i will also as recommended by honourable members and others be upgrading our representation in fyrom
i should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution
that has never been the intention
we strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent
i note with considerable concern what members say on this score
i hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress
thank you very much commissioner patten
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
agreement on comitology
but we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure
therefore the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure including possible action by the committee responsible
it makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies which is the way things used to be
the procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures
on the contrary for a long time even the european parliament was not informed
agreement was reached in  in the form of an exchange of letters between lord plumb and mr delors
it also gave it the possibility of scrutiny
a key problem is the time factor
when the european parliament is informed it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks should it so wish
nevertheless the european parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react
our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties which i and my group can only support in full
i just have one more request
in my view instead of weitergefuhrt werden mussen the wording should be erhalten bleiben mussen 
the german version is not very clear here
i would ask for that to be checked again
for the rest i warmly thank our rapporteur
mr president i congratulate the rapporteur on her report
let us remember what is at stake here
firstly the whole system is obscure
here is a real step forward in the new system that has been agreed
we are to know who is on each committee
we are to know when they meet
we are to get the agendas
we are to get the documents that are sent to them
the whole system will be more open and transparent  if still rather complex
so that is at least a step forward
our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the commission
we adopt legislation in the european union
we expect the commission to implement it
here too there is at least some progress
that is a more reasonable system
that too is a step forward
but on our other two criticisms we are less satisfied
the legislative authority council and parliament should be equal
parliament has no equivalent power
true we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system
we will have the chance to scrutinise to debate to question
in other words we can challenge the measure for being ultravires but not on its content
and in a democracy parliament should be able to challenge the content
not that we do so every week
that is lacking in this new system or at least is only there in embryonic form
that is not correct
both branches adopt the legislation  council and parliament  that confers implementing powers on the commission
if such implementing measures are referred back it should be to both branches not to one branch alone
overall we have a system which has made some progress
we have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that
we shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision
we must be very vigilant
so it is a step forward
my group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward
we are not as enthusiastic about compromising as mrs frassoni
we recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years time
if we want a union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject
mr president first i want to thank the rapporteur mrs frassoni for her work
it is never easy working on comitology
mrs schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic something we have long talked about
certainly the process has always been very complex as a result of historical decisions and these must eventually be rationalised
in my opinion the agreement reached between commission and parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process
from our point of view it satisfies the fundamental interests of parliament
mr corbett set out parliament s concerns
he says some of them have been satisfied and others have not
i would say the ones the commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied
so how far have we come
there is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point highlighted by mrs frassoni given that we now have an automatic information system
this will facilitate two activities parliament is especially interested in
i think this is a good agreement
it is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process
from here on things are going to be easier
but the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the plumbdelors agreement
we have made a start and we hope the work will produce some excellent results
we think there are other positive advances too
thank you very much commissioner solbes mira
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
protocol on the excessive deficit procedure
to date the member states have calculated this gdp in accordance with the criteria laid down in esa 
the most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in september  and it relates to the  financial year
these changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the member states national accounting
i will now describe very briefly the five areas where the most important changes may occur
first the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by government institutional sector under esa 
this is important since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government
the nonavailability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the member states government deficits
thirdly government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector as defined in esa 
fourthly government debt is defined in accordance with esa  as are the flows or interest stemming from assetsliabilities
we have already heard about the various aspects involved
what i think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable
it is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons
firstly for the single market
secondly for economic and monetary union
the regulation dating from  on the application of the protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the european system of accounts at national and regional level
that is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits
this adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the member states more precisely
it is good that the procedure exists
we need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility
the citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met
thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously
mr president the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable
this is of great importance especially in the light of european unification and the completion of the internal market
this is why this report is also so politically charged a report by the way on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly
it also inspires a few political comments
the stability pact is a given in europe
the stronger the position of the participating countries the stronger the euro will be
as a result the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded not even in a bad economic climate
this is the theory behind it anyway
we have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met
that is of great importance in order to turn the emu into a success now and in the future
various member states have taken oneoff measures to be able to meet the criteria
a drop in standards should not be allowed
we are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised
indeed we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations
 es mr president many thanks first of all to the rapporteur for his splendid work
i just mention that to complete the view of the process
secondly i would like to thank mr knorr for his speediness
he has done really good work in a very short time
this is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently
that being so i believe the final result will be better
this regulation is purely instrumental
it does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised
but we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem
but we see no reason to lower our guard
we must press on in that direction because we know it is vital
thank you very much commissioner solbes mira
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro

it is a definite and concrete issue it is about our common currency
how many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs
we cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited
it is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced
this is something which parliament has said it wants to see added
a country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself
on  january  the euro will be in circulation
it is important that in time there should be a more or less similarlooking form of protection under criminal law in all countries
the commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information together with penal sanctions preventive measures and the pooling of experience
these measures do in fact entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years imprisonment
trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences
quite simply we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty
the denominations of the euro are well known
modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves
there are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting this being a measure which we would encourage
the new applicant states are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations
it has taken two years for the council and the commission to produce this proposal
it is essential that the decision should now be taken in march
to delay or perhaps even risk damage to the euro would be indefensible
it would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new unfamiliar notes
the protective measures cover these countries too and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight
the council must now convene in march and make the relevant decision
thank you for listening
thank you too those who contributed to this matter s being dealt with swiftly i am thinking in particular of the group of the party of european socialists
the euro will enter into circulation on  january  and will become one of the world s most important reserve currencies
due to its importance on a world scale the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery
mr president i need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points mr coelho made all that is indeed very true and correct
it is easy to counterfeit the euro
we are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history
it is a highly complex problem
let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people
so what is the european union doing about it
this framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress
thank you for your attention during our night sitting together
mr president the launch of the euro could well be a heavensent opportunity for counterfeiters
that is what i would have preferred personally
however i find these passports inadequate
counterfeiting is not on the list
so we come back to the previous problem
in other words the council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis
i would also like to make a more general point
but there has been nothing for a year
just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting
however there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved
mr president for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money
these are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here
i should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker
there are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions because the point of departure is of course that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern
but the problem is that there is no legal basis for this and with good reason because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction
in that context i want to ask the following question of the commission s and the council s representatives is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate
in my view this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis
we have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it
we are also concerned with the question of cooperation
i also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or eu body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work
aside from the report which we welcome many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved
i hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification
mr president mrs cederschiold ladies and gentlemen how safe is the euro
that is after all a question the people often ask
they will need time to get used to that too
and that is what we are discussing at this late hour
but that cannot be helped
of course the european central bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time
after all it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting
that is what this framework decision is about
i certainly appreciate that
the framework decision aims to ensure that the member states apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences
it has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law
the framework decision will however have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future
the commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with europol
thank you very much commissioner schreyer
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  pm
the sitting was closed at  pm
resumption of the sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
the minutes were approved
we discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you mr president in fact conceals a huge window which if the curtain were drawn back would afford a wonderful view over the river
i think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers
thank you very much mr onesta i am grateful for any suggestions that will make our chamber more conducive to human comfort
i would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being
in the meantime i will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter technically speaking
ucits

as a new member of the european parliament it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter
the issue of ucits may appear difficult technical and a political minefield
i believe that some people do not even know what ucits stands for
collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank
in my own country more than  per cent of swedes save with a variety of funds
the security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed
the capital and securities market has continued to be developed
the current directive on ucits has become antiquated and outdated
obviously this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public s range of savings options
the commission s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts
the first concerns the product that is to say the funds
the other concerns the collective investment undertakings
special riskspreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria
the committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the commission s proposal more stringent
in addition quantitative criteria risk exposure should be introduced
in recent years the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the member states
it is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments
they are very important in this case
they must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors
the commission s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage ucits that is to say management companies
the rules for management companies for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations
a crucial point is that rules are proposed for socalled simplified prospectuses
in this regard too the committee is prepared to go further than the commission
a question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies
there are different views on this
the current situation is not good
both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of europe
to them i just want to say as the english expression goes you can t have it all

mr president at the outset i wish to place on the official record of the house my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by mr schmidt our rapporteur
i was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous parliament
we failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter
in a short space of time mr schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within parliament i thank him for that
there is little disagreement amongst members with regard to the first proposal
it puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities
however it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern
i have a number of ideas which should be put across
it seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity
we will have to revisit this issue again in the near future
as indicated by the rapporteur we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this parliament
this is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation albeit in a prudent manner
i say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution
however the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political social and personal problem with incalculable consequences
there is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings
firstly there is the problem of investment in nonharmonised undertakings falling outside this directive
we have achieved a compromise solution
we have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this or so we believe which i welcome
mr president the socialist group supports the commission s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services
the debates on ucits gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur mr olle schmidt and also mr garciamargallo y marfil for their constructive approach
the socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources
but the world of international finance is a dangerous one
the capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses
there is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home
and as international financial activity speeds up the risks increase
the legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the european financial markets
by definition investment funds use other people s money
the legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses
there is no freedom without rules
we have done away with socalled masterfeeder structures
these feeder funds exist in the united states which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system
the european market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems
as these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control the risks are all the more obvious
the socialist group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors
by adopting these amendments parliament will allow recourse to otc derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors
mr president there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance
this principle should not only guide the public sector it should also guide the private sector especially financial undertakings
i firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure safer higher returns
despite their image of danger derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance
is this speculative
not at all
then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse as it did in 
you have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash but that would be to waste your research into the winners
it would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall
the solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the nasdaq or cac  falls
in exchange you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets
that is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund
history demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and lighthanded approach to regulation
these are of course the returns after deducting all losses
do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off
this is what we should be concerned about here today
we do not in principle oppose this industry
but we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole
for years certain countries including great britain have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens
they even reject the strict minimum ie the monti package proposed by the commission in brussels
we must put an end to this
mr president the  directive introduced a sort of european visa for certain types of ucits which could be marketed throughout the union
since then the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve thanks to unbridled financial globalisation they have exploded exponentially and without restraint
this brings us to the two proposals for directives
the second proposal on which the report is excellent does not require any particular comment
it aims to strengthen consumer protection and security
the same cannot be said of the first proposal
however we are unable to agree to the text of the report although i welcome the work carried out by mr schmidt for several reasons
there is of course no reciprocity in favour of european ucits
we shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the member states to increase to  
the president cut the speaker off
mr president this is a vital issue for europe
i welcome many of the developments which mr schmidt s report brings us
ucits are a success story within the european union
they are a safe product traded crossborder
but it is time for the legislation to be updated
mr schmidt has done an excellent job here
but i appeal to this house to take a balanced and commonsense approach on this issue
the radical step taken by this report is to allow ucits to use overthecounter derivatives
i appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by ucits
mr schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of parliament for overthecounter derivatives
we must not be afraid to go forward to react to changes in the market
yes we need to continue to ensure that ucits provide a balanced and protected product for consumers
the report gives very adequate protection for consumers
but a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of overthecounter derivatives
i salute mr schmidt
thank you very much mr kuckelkorn
ladies and gentlemen i have an update for you on the curtain and window situation
if we open this curtain then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away
we will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting however i will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies
the commission proposals being debated here will give it the facelift it needs
in addition investors often have better protection with an activelymanaged fund
my amendment no  is therefore a warning for amateurs
i shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment
at the same time it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings particularly those we are concerned with today
mr president commissioner the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions
and the more consumers invest the brighter the prospects will be in the european business money markets
however i would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals
as regards derivatives i consider the position adopted by the committee justified  unlike mrs randzioplath for example
mr president i see two problems with this morning s debate
firstly i welcome proposal no 
it simplifies things and brings things up to date
i think many of the british members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report
we believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward
secondly we consider proposal no  to be very confused
it is difficult to understand and we think the commission would be well advised to look at it again
we ask the commission to look again at these proposals
mr president money does not smell as the romans would say
the important thing is for money to generate more money
in this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity
pensioners will in the future  as is already happening  have enormous sums of money at their disposal
the two proposals form a coherent whole
the first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ucits can invest
as already remarked in this session ucits are key players within the modern capital markets
since diverse types of investment are permitted private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques
the commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas
i also value the ideas put forward in amendments nos      and  although the wording needs to be adapted
i also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in amendments nos   and 
i can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of amendment no 
all the amendments i have listed so far pertain to the first proposal
the commission has suggested adopting the content of these with certain changes in the wording
however i cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands
this is why the commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal
amendment no  jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms
we cannot therefore adopt the proposed amendment for this reason
i therefore cannot see any reason why article  paragraph  should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason
however the commission will be suspending its position given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments
by rejecting the rapporteur s amendment no  the committee on economic and monetary affairs has aligned itself with the council
as far as the second proposal is concerned i already mentioned that the commission will take into consideration many amendments
amendment no  cannot be accepted because legally it cannot command any authority
lastly his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render isd activities
as regards the question put by mr huhne his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations
but hedging operations are already allowed in the existing article  of directive  on ucits
so what mr huhne wants is already possible
a question has been put by mrs villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management
the separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the council
that is the reason why the commission has put forward these two separate proposals
lastly mr balfe has complained that there are in his opinion too many limits in the whole proposal the commission has put forward
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  noon
mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states
some of these differences have already been ironed out but others persist
these are thus extremely important questions which we hope that the council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion
as regards other aspects of this subject mr president i would refer you to my written report
i should like to draw attention to the fact that the council is not present today
by contrast i welcome the attentive presence of commissioner vitorino as has consistently been the case since his appointment this leads me to another point
i condemn this as well as the council s absence
these are serious matters on which this house must act
we are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance
a political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out
this is why this report is so important
it will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular
mr president as the rapporteur said this house has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the convention
the regulation of phone tapping in the council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate
mr schulz should be aware of this
the european parliament is certainly not to blame for this
it is the governments of the member states who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree
as a result the european parliament is faced with an almost impossible task
if not we will be fighting a running battle
i therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the eu member states in the first instance
in my opinion this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all member states
as long as this harmonisation has not been achieved however we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance
the content of my amendment is in fact echoed in amendment no  which also stipulates this condition of accrual
this condition of accrual is essential since in my opinion the principle of nulla poena sine lege legality in criminal law must be observed
hence it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted
if however we would like to give european citizens a greater sense of security we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation
it is precisely in the field of legal protection that the council s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired
in the words of rapporteur mr di pietro the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings
the chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court
the fact that the council s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my group
there are certainly no restrictions in its scope
as such the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime
in fact it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law
i hope that the common sense of our fellow meps in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments
it is clear that the justice sector more than any other cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner
the report contains arguments that are too disparate which do not link together smoothly and everything thus hinges on approximations
we must first establish general rules and institutional certainties only then will we be able to institute actual conventions
in my group there are undoubtedly different views of mr di pietro s report
there are two reasons why we are saying no
i personally find it unacceptable for example for mr pinochet to be given the option to move to spain for a confrontation
these are nevertheless minor flaws which the rapporteur did not want and which  i hope  will be remedied when this chamber comes to vote
the rapporteur has made laudable efforts which should not go unnoted and for which i would like to thank him
the overall result is remarkable and i hope that the council will fully take it into account
this is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse
this is a distant goal but is one that can be attained in stages
it points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal
the lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty
legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters
article  allows interception in another member state without its involvement
not only should this be deleted the whole interception title should be scrapped
an initiative of the fbi drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation
the council proposal containing those requirements enfopol  was approved by this parliament last may in the schmid report
now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at
furthermore in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences
this leaves it wide open to abuse
that is not guaranteed
this issue is extremely serious
in that sense the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important
what did i understand on reading the related texts
that it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the council
in my opinion the legal affairs committee and the rapporteur mr di pietro have produced some very interesting work
how can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis
corinne caillaux who had probably been raped was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train
today thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants he is in portugal
i should like to ask the portuguese minister the presidentinoffice of the council to put a stop to this scandal at once
mr president this agreement deals with a sensitive issue cooperation in the field of criminal law
it is therefore understandable that the council finds it difficult to agree
successful application of this agreement by the member states requires unanimity within the council
only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice
this however does not mean that the council can work on this anonymously
quite the reverse in fact
the council s proposal must comply with legislation of the national member states in the field of criminal law
the wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test
careful parliamentary scrutiny by the european parliament but above all by the national parliaments is therefore of key importance
i am aware of the problems but i think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text
the dutch members of the group for a europe of democracies and diversities will however despite hesitation not withhold their support for the di pietro report in the final vote
the procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights
the president cut the speaker off
mr president legislating in criminal matters is often countered wrongly with arguments of individual freedom and security
is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed
is one free when security is no longer assured
and this dialogue is openended it adapts to the demands of the day
but the council s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts
it is not just a question of style
we are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter
it makes provision in article  for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ
i should like to stress this point because it is paramount
it is nothing less than legal torture
other european countries on the other hand do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt
i thus believe that mr schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks
we need hard and fast rules
the council has behaved in an unseemly manner changing tack in midcourse and is nowhere to be seen
we would on the other hand like to thank commissioner vitorino for attending the debate held in this chamber
most say it is about time
more time will pass before the convention actually enters into force given the fact that this requires member states ratification
past experience with ratification of european union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing
this convention will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance
the draft that the council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several members of parliament
this is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court
furthermore requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities
it is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations
however one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten  the right of defence
we must recognise that article  concerns what is clearly a controversial decision
the commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal
however we must be realistic
apart from that the tampere european council has already indicated in which direction we in the commission should go
the commission sincerely hopes that the european parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields
i do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years
vote
goebbels pse
the words issued by also need to be added after the words transferable securities 
madam president my apologies i was looking at amendment no  which logically precedes amendment no 
but you are right we are discussing amendment no  and here too we have a similar problem
it is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating
the text therefore reads instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation 
my apologies once again for my mistake
are there any objections to this oral amendment
parliament adopted the oral amendment
parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes
therefore particularly out of respect for you i must say that i do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this
i was told that this was a personal response
note will be taken of it in the minutes
i see that mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject
we are not going to enter into a debate now
i shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote
relating to amendments nos  and 
in other words our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading whereas malta and cyprus will participate
parliament adopted the oral amendment
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament approved the legislative resolution
before the vote
madam president i want to condemn the absence of the presidencyinoffice of the council
i also want to mention the translation problems of which i will give just one example as we do not have much time
the term legale esterno has been translated into french as avocat neutre  i have no idea what an avocat neutre is
it rather seems like a contradiction in terms
however in the spanish version the abogado has disappeared completely
madam president you have said several times that this is a very serious problem
the lawyerlinguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced
quite mrs palacio vallelersundi this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying
we shall address this problem and check all the translations
quite i am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and i shall be most happy to pass this on
relating to amendment no 
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
an s has been omitted and instead of reading la propuesta nos parece correcta  it reads la propuesta no parece correcta which is completely the contrary
i just wanted to correct this
parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution

very well i shall do so
proposal for a joint resolution on human rights
parliament adopted the resolution

relating to amendment no 
i hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this
this clarification would certainly meet with our approval
are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment

absolutely i do not think that will pose a problem

the regulation of investments in transferable securities the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners is thus a major step forward for the european union
report by olle schmidt a
 sv olle schmidt s report is an improvement on the commission s proposal
brok report a
madam president there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the european union
we have before us malta and cyprus which are two states keen to become members

the proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire
however they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the european union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire
until  this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols b
both countries also qualify for financial aid under the meda programme b
this proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases
the package will grant around euro  million in total for the two countries in the current year
it is however regrettable that the commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis
this is bound to have an impact on the ability of malta and cyprus to plan spending
the funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the community acquis 
cederschiold report a

the union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting
and the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify
each member state must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable
this is a basic element of the decision
we must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another  years
they should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation
there is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are  different national systems
that brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the european council in tampere

 i welcome this proposal to protect the euro against forgers
di pietro report a

that means making a european bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation echelon perfectly legal
this convention will lead to gross abuses of people s rights to privacy
it is a major threat to civil liberties in eu
resolution on the commission s strategic objectives for 
 commissioner prodi pointed out that africa is our responsibility and not apparently that of the usa and other major countries
two million people died of aids in africa last year approximately   died in wars
in zambia  of teachers have died of aids
our policies in africa lack coherence
there is huge duplication of effort
furthermore the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development
it is patently clear that africa has become the forgotten continent

what should this global actor s objective be
and yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen
the omission of this principal objective is highly revealing
there is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year  attached to the strategic guidelines
how strange that the commission should lose its instinct for selfpreservation just as europe is integrating
 fr i share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate
i do of course understand the constraints of the moment and i am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure
however experience has taught me that in politics modest ambitions are never the key to success
and yet our president is a fine economist
for this very reason we cannot agree to cut pensions further
there is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in  and this must not take place one moment sooner
what is more the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control
moreover these are factors which create employment

in fact the word seems to have been banished from the commission s vocabulary whereas liberal and american references abound
mr prodi talks solely of mechanisms and structures and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people

fr the european union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions
the nature of the eu has not changed
since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups
we shall vote against these objectives because we are fighting against this policy both in parliament and on the streets
we abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons
firstly the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the commission s programme
corrie report a
these fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them
the developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade despite their vulnerable economies
the cooperation agreement with south africa is a prime example
the council approved the agreement negotiated by the commission despite the fact that a basic section namely agriculture had not been finalised
it is most worrying especially as a similar agreement with mexico appears to be taking shape
we want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each member state which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature
the new agreement provides for a development budget of eur  billion over the next seven years
it is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the acp countries
strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste
civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects
while only around  of the world s population live in subsaharan africa  of all people who became infected with the aids virus in  live there
 of the  million aids related deaths in the world have taken place in this region
the aids problem in africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one
the effects of the aids pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the subsaharan region is being neutralised or reversed
it is clear that the spread of aids in the subsaharan african continent is linked to poverty
prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries
health facilities and staff of ngos need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients
it is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective
already weak economies are being further weakened in africa by the aids virus
already stretched resources are being further stretched
however on this occasion the european union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the lome convention accord

it is the humane face of europe
especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened
the partnership between the european union and the acp was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium
i am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties opening new prospects for this partnership
it should seal their revival
the joint assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of europe and the developing countries defend their common interests
the partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised

the european union prefers to send its funds to eastern europe the former ussr and asia where there is greater opportunity for profit
or on shell
while others may have the biggest rockets the eu has the deepest pockets
this is something that the eu can rightly be proud of and i think we should shout it from the rooftops more often
the labour government s record in britain is also a proud one
there is still much to be done however
the next great challenge is to relaunch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last december in seattle
it must be a development round  in which developing countries effectively excluded from previous rounds are fully included
for the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves
developing countries want trade not aid a help up not a handout
swoboda report a
in parallel it can benefit from substantial financial support via the phare programme
however the eu s present policy in the balkans is fragmentary inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature
there is no sense of regionality for the balkans which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness

in this sense the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case
frassoni report a
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
company restructuring in europe
the next item is the commission statement  company restructuring in europe
companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities
sometimes this calls for mergers of activities
in other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected
on every occasion and as recently as last october in this house the commission has highlighted the following basic positions
firstly decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management
secondly when dismissals prove to be inevitable the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned
this requires anticipation timely preparation and careful management of these processes
these basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in europe
this is what intelligent restructuring is about
we have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the european union
that is why in november  the commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support
we thank you for that
i hope that this debate contributes to reminding member states of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative
we have recently heard from the portuguese presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched
the forthcoming french presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves
they may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force
the commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this
the commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the european works council directive
as recognised in the report which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks we accept that the directive contains some loopholes
action is not limited to legislation
we are also developing another suggestion of that expert group the managing change report
let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this house
to this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years
social cohesion and the interplay of policies at eulevel is the focus of the forthcoming lisbon summit
thank you very much commissioner
mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso i understand you have a point of order
mr president the problem is one of public honour in this parliament it is not a personal statement
unfortunately this is not the first time that madam president has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me
this partisan behaviour of our president should be criticised most firmly
i will willingly accept madam president s apologies any time
thank you for your statement
we will certainly make sure that the president is informed of your statement
i can assure you that as far as i am aware the president never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote
therefore the house was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage
but thank you for your remarks
the subject in question is of great political and social importance
free enterprise free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the european union
company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments and must therefore be defended
however all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles
just now commissioner liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed
sadly in this case he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring
i would also like to point out to commissioner liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court
commissioner liikanen we expect an authoritative intervention
this is  as it was the first time round  sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies which is linked to a drop in employment
our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed
it appears that goodyear in italy received italian and european subsidies to the tune of approximately eur  million
the company went under despite this
this goes to show that jobs cannot be bought
the market is a law unto itself
as such state aid costs the government twice first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit
surely this cannot be the role of your my and the citizens tax money
a company is pilloried one day and not the next
why should this be the case
michelin caused a great stir
but i did not hear a squeak when nissan and ibm were discussed where similarly a great number of european employees were involved
this is why the liberal group will vote against paragraph  and the second section of paragraph 
if these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted my group will abstain from the final vote
i do hope that this will not be necessary
mr president the portuguese presidency and the commission s strategic objectives for  both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required
examples have been given in spain of michelin and abbalsthom and my colleagues will give examples for italy
this is just an underhand way of making workers redundant
commissioner if the european institutions really believe in what they say about full employment they must take clear steps to secure this
mr president sadly once again parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in europe
yet again workers are likely to lose their jobs
this time i am referring to the workers of the company goodyear in cisterna di latina
we are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management
the various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers be they by michelin or goodyear are symptomatic in this respect
surely europe should act as a safeguard maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare
finally allow me to remind you that the third letter of the edd group to which i belong stands for difference 
i like all members present am saddened by this loss of jobs
equally i am saddened by the announcement made by goodyear that has prompted this resolution
this house is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes in this institution forget that europe cannot survive alone
we need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent
we meps speak often about smes and have now come up with a unique way of creating them
take a large successful business add european regulations and within months you have created a small one
perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here
mr president i will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today
in this respect i share mrs plooijvan gorsel s view that we cannot talk about these in detail
but maybe next time we ought to discuss corus the merger which has now taken place between our nederlandse hoogovens and british steel
we need to gain an insight into what companies are like now
as such i would like to ask these various commission directorates and these various commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments
what is more the portuguese presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority
yet all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies
the commission s decision to allow the abbalsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point
the new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings
this global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to   jobs
the company s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying
it is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee
i do not think it is simply a matter of a community charter
eu legislation on this issue could not be clearer
we need more joinedup policy making on these issues
what we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation
this is the only way of respecting article  of the treaty
i have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken later this evening
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
racist and xenophobic incidents in el ejido spain
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mrs diez gonzalez and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in el ejido spain
b by mr bautista ojeda and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance on xenophobiarelated incidents in el ejido spain
we should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner
today s problems cannot be solved in five years
they will take a long time as we are finding out
the legislation of the member states must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in tampere as paragraph  of the motion states
legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays
collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital in this respect the action plans approved by the high level group and the tampere european council must be allocated a budget
the proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this house have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions
we all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers
we hope that the events in el ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated
yet it is not enough to regret the situation
we do not want africa to become our cross in fact quite the contrary
we must therefore act
firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors
secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration
thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect
finally we are producing a census of immigrants
these events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated
we are all immigrants
for generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated
we are all immigrants if not ourselves personally then through one of our relations or ancestors
what happened in el ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the european union
finally the european union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles
however the incidents in el ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout europe and which deserves our full attention
in this respect we must not forget that the original victim s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated
mr president commissioner andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the european union
yet a worrying situation is apparent
anyone whether european or not who lives and works in andalusia is an andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect the eu can and must speak out
for you the south is andalusia but for us andalusians it is africa
these events have also acted as a wakeup call to our consciences
those responsible for what happened in el ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants we must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution
mr president this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in spain fighting for human rights
all the spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support
employers would be lost without immigrants
working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no spaniard will accept them
what happened at el ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in europe today
for four days the immigrants were collectively hounded
women and children were beaten
fleeing from all quarters hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town
what happened in spain could happen in any country in the union if we are not careful
we all have a duty to put our own house in order
mr president acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of europe
everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements
we must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature
without wishing to lump everything together hysterically because each period is different we have failed to learn the lessons of history
that is my conclusion today
because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of almeria should have been foreseen
it is the result first and foremost of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour
we also know that many of them only earn eur  a month while their fellow european citizens can earn three times that
this precarious wageearning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable
the irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion
it just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on saturday
yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments outside the community arena some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies
the party to which the mayor of el ejido belongs should according to the commitments signed in this charter act forcefully
the lynch mob and their extreme rightwing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers but of society as a whole
we express our support for the families and friends of the victims
president prodi and commissioner diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements
naturally i completely endorse what they have said
racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our community wherever they take place
the european union has already laid the basis for community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race
this proposal is under examination by the council and the european parliament
the commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete
the european council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration
those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour
the word that is used about them in chinese society is snakeheads  it seems to me a fitting description of them
those rights are by definition universal
the el ejido incidents were shocking as several members have said in their speeches
thank you commissioner
the joint debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
human rights
indeed it is not the first time that we will be debating kosovo here
i very much appreciate it that the commission always attends
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present given his powers
but i  and many members with me  also have to note that the council is consistently absent from this debate
we need to cooperate with the council too
i think we should give this some thought
i would request you to pass this complaint on to the bureau of parliament
mr president commissioner we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons
the other reason is that this text does not unfortunately go very far
i doubt that any of you still believe that kosovo can one day become part of yugoslavia
i also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution which you no doubt overlooked
you condemn the first direct attack on the kfor troops
why not
mr president what is happening in mitrovica in kosovo is appalling and reprehensible
violence begets violence and revenge begets revenge
the police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on
he has fewer than   officers and it was agreed that there should be nearly  
i was in kosovo on  october  when the serbs withdrew
the agreement was that   osce observers should arrive to guarantee the peace
after a month however there was still only a handful of observers
atrocities were not even being recorded
then the war came and the observers were withdrawn
i would therefore ask the commissioner can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in europe
i might also ask when do you anticipate that they will be in place
and when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities
in this sense i am in agreement with mr sakellariou s proposals
flora defended herself and asked serbs and albanians to shake hands
flora brovina s husband is the guest of serbian women in belgrade
this is a sign of hope the hope that it possible to act differently even in serbia
it is not true that flora brovina has been abandoned
i believe that the european union must do likewise
the embargo on serbia must be lifted and serbia must in turn release its political prisoners
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to fully endorse mrs pack s very emotionallycharged contribution
what she has said here is completely justified
there is not one truth in kosovo there are several
i refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse  that is bending the truth
i completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us
needless to say the situation in mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why
there are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the trepca mines also plays its part
we have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners
there is a great deal of pain a lot of suffering in kosovo
the people are holding demonstrations they are sending us emails
they ask us where their children are their sons
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer
the case of flora brovina is just one of many
we are right to include this in the draft resolution but there are hundreds even thousands of flora brovinas out there
i would ask the commission and the absent council at long last to do something for these political prisoners
the fact that they are locked up in serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in kosovo
this request is fully in line with the vision held by the special representative of the un in kosovo mr bernard kouchner
the un however have pledged to dispatch a police force of  
to date however mr kouchner only has about   police troops at his disposal
moreover half of this group is from the united states and germany
what is disconcerting however is mr kouchner s sharp criticism levelled at the french government these days
paris is leaving its fellowcountryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen not more than  in the crisis region
for this hardly honourable position mr kouchner blames none other than the minister for home affairs mr chevenement
according to mr kouchner the minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the french police officials on ideological grounds
i would ask the council and the commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the european parliament of the outcome
press freedom in angola
mr president i do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity
on the question of angola i think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last
it would be the first in a long time
so i welcome it as such
clearly governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial geostrategic or economic interests
a free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy
mr president how much longer can we continue our cooperation with angola
human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time not only by unita but also by the government itself
the legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle
additionally european observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists
europe as a major donor has so far remained too passive with regard to angola
if the angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate measures will need to be taken
without national reconciliation reconciliation with europe is not possible
this being the case angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond
yet this is not the situation
angola does not enjoy rule of law it is a repressive dictatorship
it is at war and a bloody war at that which is dragging on and on
the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept
these cases keep occurring
yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in angola
i must draw attention to the fact that the war in angola is spreading to other parts of africa
there are two sides in angola or rather two armed groups
it has led to a critical and tragic situation in angola
this war must be stopped
this was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the first world war of africa given the involvement of certain countries in others
it is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in angola
like a previous speaker i also fully support the appeals which have been made
we must some time soon find the courage to tackle the whole angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously
the people of angola deserve better
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen it seems as if the world is turned upside down
this is angola s reality
we are now expressing our horror concerning this war
this is a war which transcends its borders it is not just unita which is to blame
we would at the same time like to insist on other things
but what do these sanctions mean
it is the western world itself which is partly to blame
it is we our own people who keep the war going over there
the socalled civilised world should hang its head in shame
mr president we are partly to blame for this war
we should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war
mr president the facts are wellknown
on  december the angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the portuguese paper expresso to a year s imprisonment and a fine of usd  
the journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the president s cabinet
the trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness
these are only two examples of a trend in angola to silence any government critics
over the past year more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security
but at the same time we note that great britain and also portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government
there is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding angola
in my opinion angola is a test case
we should at any rate judge the portuguese presidency on its actions and not on its words
native americans in the us  dineh
we have to admit that our european sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect
once again an indigenous people s right of existence is being threatened
once again the individuality dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest
but if we are to believe the environmental movements even this is vain hope
there are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the socalled new lands
it very much remains to be seen whether these new lands will be safe in terms of public health
the credibility of the industrialised north is at stake
this is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time
it is up to the european parliament to protect vulnerable people
so we need to do this
it is important to point this out
we have just approved the water directive here in parliament
the forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally
people should no longer be forced to move
over the past  years no less than   people have been forced to move and this must stop
if people need to move at all they need to be given a viable alternative
this is not the case here
the account of the dineh indians is telling
it is now the intention to send the last   dineh indians to this land
this too is characteristic of american society which hears little about it
there are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful economic adversary
the dineh people belong to the northamerican navajo indians
they are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years
they have been living in harrowing living conditions for years
this relocation is of course unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic social and cultural terms
the relocation act was pushed through in congress by a group representing the coal mining industry
the population was not allowed any input
this resembles a kind of trade in human beings
the relocation scheme was implemented and the dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium
it is high time we respected the rights of the indians
so let us contact the united states now
mr president in terms of human rights there is of course a great deal amiss in chechnya
citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in airraid shelters
we insist that these violations of human rights are investigated
despite the pledges made violations in for example alfanyurt have still not been investigated
we want information from the russian authorities as to mr babitsky s whereabouts and his state of health
mr president a journalist is on a factfinding mission and this calls for freedom
yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war
the war in chechnya like any war is a trail of horrors
the filtration camps are camps in which torture rape and violations are perpetrated we know that now
and just what is mr cfsp doing
what are we doing about it
i beg you to intervene
the entire federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda
a warlord has become president and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters
the russian government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes
i can only reiterate my appeal to the council and the commission to stick to the rules
it is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the eu if it does not recognise democratic principles
mr president what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as terrorists and bandits 
the victim of this exchange is said to be the yearold war correspondent of radio free europeradio liberty andrey babitsky
in the meantime the highest russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist
this distressing ambiguity on the part of the kremlin is not really surprising
the facts are clear
andrey babitsky was an unwanted busybody in mr putin s antiterrorist operation in chechnya
hence his disappearance of over one month
this resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the chechen tragedy
nor is it a mere luxury
indeed it is in line with some thirty russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on andrey babitsky free of charge
cambodia
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial
every time just as the exchange was about to take place we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists
every time when we asked why the reply was the same we cannot release him he is a war criminal 
these papers actively support the opposition politician mr sam rengie
legal proceedings have been initiated against sam rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason
this is notably the only party in cambodia which has no military arm
the pattern of intimidation is clear
all this is happening on a daily basis
even more serious is the government s refusal to bring the leaders of the khmer rouge before an international tribunal
it is true the civil war in cambodia is over and political tension has eased
this is what is at stake now in cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice
at the same time the struggle against impunity is under threat
the situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the treaty for an international criminal court has been shamefully slow
 mr president we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday
in particular we support the development of a free democratic and multiethnic society
we have always condemned ethnic violence no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim
we consider it is unacceptable against serb and roma minorities as it was against the kosovar albanians in the past
it was a point raised by several speakers in the debate
we continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in serb prisons
the plight of kosovar albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing
it is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society
an area of special concern is the harassment of journalists including temporary detention of members of the socalled independent press
we are also committed to the security council s sanctions against unita including arms controls
the european union has condemned the use of antipersonnel landmines and we are supporting demining operations through an international ngo
this is a subject which is not given sufficient attention
there are alarming reports of human rights violations
of course there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict
the commission delegation in moscow participated in a european union troika demarche on the eleventh of this month
we await a proper response from the russians
in the meantime the conclusions of the general affairs council earlier this week have confirmed the message which i have given today
i totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by mr morillon
we vigorously supported the troika demarche to foreign minister hor namhong on  february this year
at the same time we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties
i am encouraged by the optimism of kofi annan secretarygeneral of the un on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal
it has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days
thank you very much commissioner patten
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
danube environmental disaster
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr leinen on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists
b by mr maaten and mrs thors on behalf of the group of the european democrat and reform party
b by mr oostlander and mrs grossetete on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and the european democrats
b by mr papayannakis and mr sjostedt on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left
b by mrs schroedter and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a romanian goldmine into the lepos somes tisza and danube rivers
this disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a european union
we therefore welcome commissioner wallstrom s brief visit for it can contribute to this awareness
the polluter ought to pay
i would be in favour of its doing so
mr president commissioner there has been one ecological disaster after another and unfortunately they are all similar
the delta of the danube is in danger
this new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries
the authorities in these counties which are still very frail from an environmental point of view need to overcome numerous obstacles
i hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility
the environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the european continent
it must form the basis for our partners political will
the efforts already being made need to be stepped up
the european continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the polluter pays principle
i therefore believe that the european union must to start with carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in europe
if we do not we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent
it is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today
is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals
the answer of course is an emphatic no
there must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide
it has already been banned in most eu countries for a long time now
that an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs
it also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant states
we must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people s health and the ecosystems
we know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions
who is going to pay
 let me associate myself not least as a former environment minister completely and without any reservation whatsoever with the expressions of concern by honourable members
an objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage
but early reports suggest that the poisoning of the lepos tisza somes and danube rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy
it has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days
no living organisms from microbes to otters have been spared
several members have set out what seems to have happened
we have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens
it has affected the peoples of three countries  romania hungary and yugoslavia
it is the tisza hungary s second river perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people that has borne the brunt
as with all such disasters it is the longterm consequences that are the most pernicious
some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river
there is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish
we stand ready to do so
it is to that end that our efforts are now engaged
there is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the romanian authorities
this is an important point as several speakers have suggested
the polluterpays principle is a cornerstone of european union environmental policy
it is mirrored in the international convention for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river and it should be applied in this case
the european union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due
the union has mobilised some eur  million over the past seven years to support protection of the danube river basin
we will want in the longer term to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place
but for now the priority is to cope with this crisis
as i have said my colleague commissioner wallstrom is on the spot today
she will want to keep parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
vote

the real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures but banning them
tourism and employment
 rapporteur
the term tourism must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun sea and holidays which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level
those figures are incomparably higher for some countries
another factor is that the world market is growing explosively
the forecast is for ten billion tourists in  but unfortunately for europe there is a reverse trend
europe s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of asia the far east and america
there is a shortage of facts we have no information on the economic impact which still remains a complete mystery
first and foremost we need to compete in terms of quality
mr president there are three points i wish to address
the first is the inclusion of a legal base in the treaty
this is something i favour but currently as part of a minority in my own group
second there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism
the resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism
at the same time the commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks
third there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment
but there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment
students are an obvious example
we have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection
but it is also a very vulnerable sector as we recently saw with the oil slick
a flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick
when it comes to tourism we can no longer do what we like where we like
this could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs
but these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors
we must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism
tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future
i can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector
we have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones
i know that action is being taken against this socalled tourism elsewhere but we must remember the european union s responsibility at this level
finally i should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy
the draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the treaty
this was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism
having heard many members who share the view expressed in the opinion this was a real relief
unfortunately his text has not survived the vote
it does however support my view that i am not apparently the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion
this brings me to the content of the report
an important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment
especially in the southern member states the tourist industry is a major source of income
from this vantage point there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy
the seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention
i am surprised however at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of community policy
this is not desirable either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment
the discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors
within these regions a huge range of problems have their part to play
for this reason i cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to european level
in addition employment policy in general is also a factor
here too the structure of the economy differs for each member state and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse
it will not do for one type of policy probably with many exceptions and adaptations to be applied
this would mean that the eu would unjustly be removing tasks from member states and that the brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily
it is preferable for member states to take measures to stimulate employment themselves
their expertise is of course superior to that of the commission
this is why i am very hesitant when it comes to formulating community measures to promote employment
even in the tourism industry
it would really be a nuisance if parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers
mr president you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands
first of all i should like to thank mr viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report
it is a very extensive report
i hope that the commission will not forget that
tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation
we need a more dynamic vision based on tourism s contribution to job creation
i know the commissioner is very keen on information technology
he has convinced me of that
but his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together
there are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal testbed therefore for integrating job creation strategies
let us look at some of these reasons
the importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one
the availability of unskilled temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the community
we are losing market share
i believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive
i hope you will help us
in view of all this i think it is a serious contradiction that there is no european policy on tourism
the lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector
but we must support our tourism
clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level
since then however there has been no progress
employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious thereby hampering its sustainable development
let us not forget that in the most remote regions tourism is the most important industry in terms of income
i would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly
yet there is a council resolution from last june on tourism and employment
what expectations does the commissioner have that the new intergovernmental conference which is starting will include this aspect
tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the european union
it regards tourism for senior citizens
however in this case the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens
tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen states and of the entire world closer together and of course it leads to peace and understanding
this kind of tourism which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens is just as important
 mr president i would first like to thank the rapporteur mr viceconte and congratulate him on the report
i am glad to see that the commission and parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area
employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism
this will determine the success of our work
certainly the commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies
this will also be important with a view to the special summit in march where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment
as far as specific policies are concerned i would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses  regional policy
the commission expects member states to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming
regarding sustainability indicators the european environment agency is already working with the commission on the issue
these possibilities should be fully exploited
mr provan said that i often talk a lot about tourism and information technology
i am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for european tourism
the travel and tourism sector is the frontrunner in making use of ict tools
this will dramatically change the way it operates
marketing reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement
use of ict opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism
direct business to consumer contact will supplement and sometimes also reduce the currently nearly exclusive business to business relationship
it will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products
commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach
in the autumn the commission will report back on the progress made in this respect
mr medina ortega asked me some very concrete questions
at the moment the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem
we need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies
why is it so important in that sector
that is where the potential is
there is one problem that i hesitate to mention today as i am new in the sector
then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work
that is the real difficulty which we must overcome
as far as the treaty is concerned the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet
tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the eu
we will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
i thank the president mrs fontaine who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this house
thank you mr nogueira for your explanation
i would remind you that questions on the minutes should refer to the minutes
on  february mrs nicole fontaine president of the european parliament received as guests at their request the representatives of the forum d ermua
the spanish vicepresidents of the european parliament were represented
strasbourg  february 
i therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up
mr president i would like to request a correction to the minutes regarding the vote on amendment no  of the swoboda report
please note that mr michel raymond mr jean saintjosse and i voted against this amendment
we take note and this will appear in the minutes
we should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings
i have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform
we can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers
so i think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all
surely we should be more selective
in any event the bureau will consider your suggestion
the minutes were approved
vote
we think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective
mr president the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the european union
one such area is tourism which by its very nature is very much a national concern
in so far as tourism falls within the political domain it should be at national regional and local level
even in that respect any cooperation should however be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle
because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation
however such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy
the report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism
policy on tourism is not however something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the european parliament or by the eu as a whole
i am therefore voting against the proposal
we will proceed to the debate itself and mr monti will take the floor on behalf of the commission
european postal services
they can also be consulted on the commission s internet website
i am sure commissioner bolkestein will listen carefully to all parliament s comments
furthermore the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation
the date set for completing the next phase which the commission intends to keep to is  january 
and in the absence of any energetic action by the commission the situation has gone on for far too long
the eu s competition authority has intervened in all other areas but not in the postal sector
one of the eu s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market
we are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more member states
that requires greater efficiency which in turn is dependent on competition
it has been done in a number of different areas but unfortunately the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now
it can hardly be because customers are satisfied
we are all familiar with the muchcriticised price hikes and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion
if we really want a functioning internal market we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services
a number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services
the netherlands finland and sweden have travelled furthest along this road
during the s they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved
moreover sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus
the process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement
prior to this discussion a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies
it is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by  per cent since liberalisation in 
however for the  per cent of services where there is a competitive market prices have fallen
that shows that competition really is working
my conclusion is therefore make sure that there is competition in the remaining  per cent of the market too
it is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for 
the speaker is interrupted by mr markov i thought i had the floor
perhaps we can discuss this later on
that is usually the case
mr markov in five or six minutes time you will be allowed a few minutes to speak
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members
mr president there is a mystery
what happened to the postal services directive that was passed on  december 
there has been a deafening silence from the commission during the period between then and now
i am sorry it is commissioner monti who is here today
i am very fond of him
he is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners
it is a pity i cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues
there has over this period been no real progress on the postal services directive
commissioner monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties
that has only happened recently
for over a year the old commission could have done some work on this
we really have not progressed very far
these issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive
the postal service is not just for christmas
it is for life
in the area in scotland i come from it is much more than just a postal service
it is about keeping communities together
the postal service is also the bus service
the postal service is also the social service
the postal service is also the doctor
we will cut them off
the postal services are important
that message must be taken back from here today
the commission must listen to it
mr president we are in favour of liberalising the union s postal services
this should first of all stand for better service
this is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal
liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly
the question is therefore what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet
as far as i know that has still not happened
i would therefore ask you commissioner to help me in my task as a new member
my second point concerns the universal provision of services what is happening on this score how much does it cost how does it work how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have
i would welcome more concrete information on this
apparently the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so
there are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the post office
we should not overlook this fact postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels
the postal service is also extremely important to companies
a study has shown that  of the postal traffic is between companies and only  between individuals
what exactly do you intend to liberalise
there are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job
we need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things
this concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today
that is not the sort of postal service that we want
let us point out that parliament s positions were clearly defined and that the group of the greenseuropean free alliance supported them
in practice that means the following for the postal services firstly priority must be given to employment
i have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation but the premises must be right
secondly we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services
examples in germany and sweden show that this certainly is a risk
so that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent
well for the time being the revision has not got off the starting block
the two initial phases were not observed which logically ought to compromise the third
my first question is this surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case
apparently they were
should we complain about this delay
we do not think so
what are the scenarios for development and the potential risks
this solution would not in our opinion be a fair one and indeed the commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it
but other countries in other situations may have alternative analyses
in our opinion each one must be free to make its own organisational choices
but who defines these tasks
who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised
to wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions
what has become of it
do we have the results of this impact study
this is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service
so you can appreciate why i am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation
as you know in our country each village has its own local post office or at least a post box with a collection every day
the postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents
so he delivers money too and sometimes even medicines thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home
once again europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants
everyone is free to choose their lifestyle
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment
in sport the saying goes do not change a winning team
why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory
the universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget
we are told we should change the limit from  grammes to  grammes or even  grammes
so be it but the  grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies
in ireland some services are provided by companies from outside ireland for example english companies certainly operate there
but this directive has never been transposed into national law
that has not been done in ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government
a small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators
i come from a rural area
we allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education
our older people even though on social welfare can enjoy the benefits of travel
but complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in ireland
i want the commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service
it should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas
we must implement what the directive insists on that the postal service is available to everybody
the postal services in greece great britain the netherlands or belgium are of course all different
how are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office s business abroad
we have just heard mr mccartin on the subject
but what will those limits be
it is selfevident that liberalisation is not an end in itself but only a means towards improving services
but then again the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment
once again the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce
liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services
post office outlets in scotland as we have heard handle much more than just mail delivery
such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote
they are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs
the existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors
the newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices
such companies have always been around but they used to be banned whereas these days they are being heralded as progress
the end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices
they will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages
it is time we stopped this trend
a fault confessed is half redressed
we are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled
it is clear that electronic mail electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future
i also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service
the collection sorting transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension
i believe that in future we must seize this opportunity
as politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests
we want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid
that faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services
but i also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive
we should define the universal service precisely establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender
they also play a major role in maintaining links between people
the european parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs
the delays in the commission s work will inevitably have a knockon effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of  must certainly be called into question
the sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services
it would be a disaster if action were deliberately or even inadvertently taken which had the effect of damaging that
i do not believe that it is anybody s intention to do so
i do not believe that the commission has set out to make war upon the islands of scotland or greece
but they might accidentally do great damage
the point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place
the critical thing is to balance universality and affordability
the message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the house to the commission today is that the commission should tread warily
the commission should not for example take a stepwise jump from  grammes to as some have suggested as low as  grammes
on the contrary it should proceed cautiously
i imagine anything less than  grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances
stand by universality and affordability
mr president the only way to guarantee a highquality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service
this service must therefore be kept public
in our opinion the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted including its timetable
i think ours is a different approach
i think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs
he does not need a government to do so or a parliament nor does he need a commission to do so
the postal market is limping along behind and sadly we have wasted valuable time here
i believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends
i am thinking here of the very sound words of mr rubig who also talked about ecommerce
i believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market
it also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of european policy
we should seize that opportunity for the citizen keeps asking why do we have europe
these are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of europe
i am glad mr monti the commissioner for competition is here today in person for he is pursuing an excellent policy
yet i believe that as this debate has shown we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas
so i would ask you to give an impetus in that direction together with parliament
i believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits the positive aspects of competition
i emphasise the word could  and that is if it is done well and with care
wrongly done the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality
i think this policy has been reasonably successful in finland as testified by the present public system
it would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers millions of service users in a great rush
postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators
whether total or partial privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse
one example of this slow progress is the way the commission is proceeding
this study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last
this brings me to my second point namely the snail as symbol of our postal services
letters to strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner but it still takes far too long
that means that since the days of mailcoaches and taxis we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services
but what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite
some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman let me add to that the importance of the post offices
they have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas
i come from munich a very densely populated urban conglomeration but we have the same problem there
one urban district post office after another is being closed down
that is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed
this has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations
in the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the european union what consequences would that have for free competition
we do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place
my prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services
mr president the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser s or a fitness centre
for us in finland a sparsely populated country a visit to the post office is a social event
in the world of networking the mail service is the most democratic of all networks
it creates and maintains interpersonal relationships
the common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers
for us in the north it will mean that the eu will be destroying the social infrastructure
the post office is democracy
it is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies
democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office
i would suggest that there is a solution
it is already employed widely in the transport sector
let us call this a negative tender franchise
the lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time
why could not the subpost office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender
otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace
that is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services
scotland as a country is larger than some member states
such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities such as a school a post office and a shop
it is on the last two that the elderly in particular depend
often they are located together each service being made more viable by the existence of the other
scotland also has many island communities some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries
and it is about four times the postage cost actually charged
the more remote the community the greater the difference becomes
that is the measure of the problem
i will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by commissioner bolkestein
some members like mr stenmarck complain that there have been delays with the new proposal
others believe that it is not so bad after all if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation
this is for example the position expressed by mr berthu
but we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made
it is commissioner bolkestein s intention to present such a proposal to the commission for adoption in the first half of this year
the scheduled date of  january  for implementation of the next steps remains feasible
a number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence
the implementation deadline for the member states is january 
further liberalisation will occur afterwards
in some areas competition is already taking place as in the parcels sector and in the express services
the quality of services has generally speaking improved in particular in regard to crossborder activity
so this is not a sellingout of the service and of its quality
in the postal sector the first phase is already in progress as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation
the new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment
the studies have been the object of some criticism especially on the part of the public postal services
i am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data
this was no surprise since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection
does that not say a lot about management ability
no single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties
nevertheless mr bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decisionmaking process
i finally come to three interventions about a subject i am supposed to know better than postal services that is competition
this applies both to the post and other sectors
we have just received the reply of the german government to the observations made
in a sense this is where its work begins
finally mr radwan of course there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition
that concept i reject firmly because competition is there for the citizens and for them alone
most companies hate competition
competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens their economic interest and for their liberty
thank you very much commissioner
pursuant to rule  i have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the resolution explanations of vote
this does not mean that we approve the entire contents which are too vague and which leave out the main concern
postal services must continue to be public services
consequently the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of europe must keep their monopoly of this service
the post office and more generally all public services must on the other hand recruit additional staff
such jobs are unquestionably useful and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in europe
if we dismantle the public service this would be very serious and we wish to know what are the commission s intentions
saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate
postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service
occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day
we can salute them these postmen who whatever the weather sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone
profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion
mr president i voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives
i wholeheartedly agree
however it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints
that should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman
i know that this service is unprofitable
it would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages
i feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service even if our post offices operate like businesses

fr here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation
if liberalisation continues in this area too then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service
i am a european and even a federalist
president
parliament has completed the agenda
the minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by parliament at the beginning of the next partsession
adjournment of the session
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
the sitting was closed at  am
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday  february 
statement by the president
these men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy
i utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society
the rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the european union is based
terrorism whatever form it takes is unacceptable
i would ask you ladies and gentlemen to observe one minute s silence in memory of fernando buesa blanco and jorge diez elorza
the house rose and observed a minute s silence
he was a member of the basque regional parliament spokesman for the socialist party in that parliament and also a former vicepresident of the basque regional government
the following is a translated extract from his autobiography we are in europe
in my grandparents time it took several days to travel from vitoria to seville
now you can go from vitoria to copenhagen in  or  hours by plane
today at the end of the th century a single market is operating in europe in which we will soon be using a single currency
we are building a vast european area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically
this process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and what is more desirable
what difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function
we in the basque country could ask ourselves the same question does it really matter if we are basque or spanish or european
what difference does it make to be basque surely it is all the same thing
you can be what you want to be
may he rest in peace
loud applause
in recent times in this house we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in europe
it does not matter what banner these come under because in the end they are all different expressions of the same thing
faced with these we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead
loud applause
the terrorist organisation eta has in its time killed police officers and soldiers
it has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men women and children
in the streets of madrid it has killed a general quintana lacaci who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 
it has assassinated the spokesman of the popular party in the town council of san sebastian gregorio ordonez
eta must be condemned however those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned
there is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road
this madam president is the only way forward which we therefore fully support
why does parliament not meet in all the countries of the european union and show that it rejects terrorism
let us make ourselves heard
we are not just confined to brussels or strasbourg
in northern ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured  too many families shattered
we euskal herritarrok have regretted many times the loss of human lives
we share with all the basque citizens the sufferings of our people
may i ask quousque tandem  noiz arte
thank you mrs duhrkop duhrkop i should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
you promised parliament you would raise this subject with the quaestors that very evening
but we shall have a decision very soon
the minutes were adopted
reforming the commission
the next item is the commission statement on reforming the european commission
i shall give the floor straight away to the president mr romano prodi
 it madam president ladies and gentlemen last july here in your presence i made a solemn commitment to reform the commission
i would like to emphasise that on that occasion too the commission voted unanimously with one voice
briefly these are the main points of the reform
one definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources
this is at the heart of the system and it is this the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board
in this context activitybased management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives actions and resources
the second point is human resources
it is the central part of our reform our staff are the commission s best asset its richest resource
this was the impression i received when i first became president of the commission and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work
however at the same time i have found that morale amongst the commission s staff is very low
all this has to change and this is one of the main reasons for our reform
these are the areas in which changes will be made
the third point which was also rather a sensitive key issue in the recent crisis is financial management
we are going to create a management and control system in every directorategeneral
we are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place
in fact the commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of europe and the world
we also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology
we want to be a model of a completely computerised administration
the commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper and so we are going to become a paperless commission
this is not just a technical revolution but a complete organisational revolution as well
the adoption of the white paper marks the end of a chapter of history  and i hope that it will remain closed forever
the very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this fiveyear plan
this is why we are redefining all our work priorities
for this reason we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently
we will make the best use of the resources at the commission s disposal but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them
the commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone  on what we achieve
i would however remind you and this is my final point that the commission is not the only community institution
parliament and the council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms
the white paper puts reform in its proper political context
in the commission systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred
the sustained independence and strength of the commission are of course basic to that mission as this house has repeatedly recognised
reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too
but the commission does exist to serve the union and its peoples with high standards of performance
the house will be aware of course that the commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone
all institutions in the european union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly
inevitably that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended
if they are proven not to be we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority
i do not make this point because of any desire in the prodi commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities
in each of the three pillars of reform the active support and cooperation of this house will be absolutely vital
the role of the budgetary authority in the operation of abm will therefore be vital
attempts to micromanage the commission s operations are clearly in no one s interest
a resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will therefore be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activitybased management
again that will be a very demanding challenge
in the limited time available for this statement it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals
it is clear of course that in many ways the really hard work starts now with the implementation of our proposals
thank you commissioner kinnock
we shall now move on to question time
madam president the commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials
there is effective legal precaution
now there were two points i wanted to pick up with mr kinnock if i may
the first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms
big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the commission and outside
indeed it was not until  that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced
i suggest that is too long and we really must move forward much more quickly than that
the second point that i want to make concerns information technology
cultures are products of structures and systems and the structures and systems have become old
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour
i share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices
i do not use those as an excuse
i would like everything to happen much more quickly
it is better to do it absolutely properly
mr prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities
we will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first
enlargement  that is enlargement of the union  is one of the key challenges in this context
could mr kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the council and parliament to come up with for these priorities
can i assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out
two questions if i may
we anticipate if i understand correctly a report in september on core activities
let the managers manage
so far as the september communication is concerned it is unprecedented
that is a sensible forecast to make it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain
as i said earlier our ambition is total security for money and value for money
we are also interested in value for the people who work for us
the changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that
i hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage
there is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current financial controller by the financial regulation

lastly on transition i share the reservations of mrs theato over socalled soft law 
there are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the white paper
two other points i must make because this is an essential question central to reform
irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline
lastly the system we currently have  as the committee of independent experts asserted very strongly  is now unsustainable
indeed the court of auditors has called it fiction
madam president great importance has been attached to the reform process which deserves to be acknowledged although this may be somewhat premature
my question is this there is a need for reform due not least to the accession of new countries and thus to the enlargement of the union
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering
that is the level of sophistication and provision i would like to see
all i can do now is to promise to strive for it
can i start by wishing the commissioner a very happy st david s day
thank you for the presentation
that really has to be the sharp focus the whole time
that is a clear complaint that we get
that needs to be addressed
the other question i would like to ask is on the audit progress committee
will you be adding that into your audit progress committee s work
as far as excessive paper is concerned the dilemma is spelt out by mrs morgan
we shall certainly strive in order to do that and i think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent
i know i can rely on everyone here
that concludes question time
i should like to thank president prodi and commissioner kinnock
statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy
the next item is the statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy
please give a very warm welcome to mr javier solana to whom i shall hand over without further delay
madam president ladies and gentlemen it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again here in the european parliament
sometimes we may feel that too much has happened
this afternoon i should like to share with you some ideas particularly on the common foreign and security policy
these are the opening of the intergovernmental conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the european union
i will speak of this briefly if you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time i will be pleased to answer them
decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent
these were essentially of three types which i will describe
the first is a political and security committee the second is a military committee representing the chiefs of staff of the fifteen member states and the third committee is to make decisions on the european union s relations with third countries and other organisations
i will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events
i was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch
you can be satisfied with the progress made
this military committee as you can imagine will have various duties
in less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the commission
i will now move on to the second issue which i should like to discuss with you we have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility
i will set this out in five points
we must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well
thirdly we must look at the differences between the headline goal and what each country can provide
how can we do this
this is what we are doing and we are committed to this
i have two further points to make on this process
secondly we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with nato the operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types
as far as possible we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in kosovo and the balkans
we are working in this direction with the commission and commissioner patten
on saturday morning i will meet with all the ministers for home affairs of the fifteen member states to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well
in this respect we are also working closely and positively with the commission
i am not going to say much more on these issues
the situation in the refugee camps in ingushetia is poor and deteriorating
yet there is one positive point which i must share with you
these are the only positive aspects which i can tell you about at the moment
madam president this brings me to the end of my speech
i would just like to repeat what i said at the beginning
europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world
thank you very much indeed mr solana i shall now give the floor to mr poettering on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats
thank you mr poettering
commissioner would you like to speak now or a little later
the commissioner indicated that he would speak later very well thank you
madam president commissioner patten mr javier solana usted no es una persona loca todo lo contrario you are not mad quite the opposite
we are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the helsinki summit
we know that you have an important role in this
we cannot of course talk about foreign policy without mentioning chechnya
my friend jacques poos will be talking about this on behalf of my group
i want to concentrate on kosovo
it is now quite clear that the situation in kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means
it has now reached the point where the pentagon has prohibited american forces from returning to northern mitrovica
they have now been replaced by robust danish finnish and swedish troops
through the stability pact we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation
this is therefore a test of credibility for the union s common foreign and security policy
at the moment there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in kosovo
last autumn we already heard mr bernard kouchner call for a civilian police force
i hope that this discussion will in the first place concentrate upon kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied
therefore the eu must also have an independent credible conflictprevention capacity
on behalf of the commission commissioner patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction
how have these been organised by mr solana s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the commission
i am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks
such a split would only delight the despots and rogue states which threaten freedom and human rights
i believe you heard the concerns which some members of the american congress expressed last week here in parliament
when we are divided we are weakened and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged
so maintain as close contact as possible with our american allies and do not forget norway turkey and canada either
you also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers
as george robertson has said so often we have two million soldiers but could not even put   soldiers into kosovo
it may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war
diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats
everything else is wishful thinking
the third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny
this should be exercised first and foremost in the member states
no soldier can of course be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament
it is therefore wrong for people to talk about a european army
it will be a force comprised of various national units
however there is of course also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the european parliament
yesterday a few of us met the portuguese defence minister
bear in mind that there are also nonaligned countries at the negotiating table
we share your delight as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired
mr president mr solana we are all behaving like children
you are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year  calls for   soldiers
it is extraordinary what decisions we took in sintra concerning   
but what about kosovo in the year 
he tells the story of a serbian doctor who has just been murdered in pristina
he treated roma albanians and serbs and that is something unforgivable in kosovo
a man with three children and he was murdered
we need policemen in kosovo right now
we need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice
i am not a warmonger but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in kosovo then what is the point in having soldiers at all
people may have to risk their lives in kosovo but that is the price of freedom at the moment
tell me what civilian forces are being mobilised mr patten
mr poettering is right  when he is right you have to tell him so
he is not always right but in this case he is
i am in favour of a hardline policy against austria but we shall then have a responsibility towards russia
we are accomplices in the massacres in chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers
it is not enough just to say you the murderers please stop the slaughter
they know full well that they should not commit these acts
do you think that mr putin does not know that what he is doing in chechnya is not good
but that is his strategy he instigated this war
from the beginning he wanted this war in order to become president
so that is the world as it is today
i believe that european defence should be scrutinised by the european parliament and by the national parliaments
as long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements we shall not be credible
but to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether
what interests will this socalled force defend in view of the fact that the countries of europe do not have the same interests
let us just consider for a moment
what is the basis of armed action
it is the defence of a territory the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital
in short what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy
a foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one s own interests
but the cfsp will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system
it is still the old imperial service
you might have added mr solana to give me their instructions  because that is what we see in fact
in the case of the balkans just like everywhere else one day the united states wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it
yes jeanclaude martinez was indeed right to interrupt you daniel cohnbendit in every case it is followmyleader syndrome
do you think i am going over the top
every day the news brings more proof of our subservience
the experts speak of a cultural problem i think they might be right
you say that you are against war but as secretarygeneral of nato you started a war
today even mr cohnbendit  and that is saying something  can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for
we also have several questions to ask you that show our concern that is the least one can say
secondly if you do recognise this right then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on
i can already hear your reply humanitarian standards
in kosovo it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in serbia
restore hope  do you remember
finally you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management
not to make war of course but to protect peace
but these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions
mr solana these questions convey our concern
you say that you are against war but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that
may god spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward
given poland s rather critical stance this question is all the more pressing
its reservation is captured in the following rather blunt wording avoid american isolationism and european separatism
if anything the european defence identity should serve to strengthen nato 
we all very much share this opinion
these opinions add substance to my question addressed to mr solana
poles only need five words for this nothing about us without us
what do the current eu member states intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries
it should be acknowledged however that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by members
the portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies
one of these milestones was the meeting in sintra which i would like to ask mr solana about
for my part i do not wish to give up hope
indeed we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective in any case the objective that i wish to achieve
i should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the what is to be done variety
the first concerns the forthcoming european councils in june and december without counting the extraordinary council meeting in lisbon
what are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings
and finally what do you most need at these next summits
my second question is different although it is not unconnected with the previous one
it concerns the next igc
i believe that the italian president of the council mentioned this point at your meeting on  february
can you tell us your position on this subject
mr president bosnia and kosovo have shaken europe
at long last the european union realises that it cannot afford to always give the americans the political and military initiative
the decision to set up our own peace force is excellent
however if europe wants to take military action at crucial times the treaty must include a flexibility clause
mr solana can play an important role in this
he is not stupid certainly not
he is a driven man a competent man
but the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence
one wonders whether he gets any time to sleep mr president
his position threatens to eclipse that of commissioner patten as has been illustrated again today in fact
this too is unacceptable in my view
mr solana must keep europe awake without nodding off himself
we have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy cultural diversity and tolerance
some of them are our acp partners
the war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment
in kosovo we stepped in with military means having been unable to prevent the war in exyugoslavia
we are now unable to guide the peace
this is why europe is not credible as a union
i do not believe mr solana that we can restore this credibility by military means
at the moment europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of
i can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level
because our borders do not stop at the mediterranean sea
mr president allow me to start with the conquest of kosovo
mr solana has confirmed our view that in a militarised european union nato will have the upper hand
we have taken fifteen years to achieve economic and monetary union
we know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the community
today they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy and i believe that they are working with that in mind
but i do wonder what his own view is on this
according to the documents cooperation with the high representative was fruitful
but do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light
we would then have a voice in nato through this european pillar
actually i hear less and less about this
it seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation which would work very well
but is there not more to it than that
i cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy nato s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence
the european pillar does not really function any more as such europe is not venturing beyond the petersberg tasks
is this actually how we want things done
will it be omitted
at the same time an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets
i wonder how this will develop
i would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the longterm future
is it necessary to give further attention to this during the igc or will the treaties inevitably set the ball rolling
i am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy
the fabric of turkey s government contains a few haidertype personalities
that would seem odd to me
secondly the baltic states are also knocking on our door
will they also take part in our defence policy
it is a very interesting position to be in to say the least
however this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the ongoing intergovernmental conference even further
a word of warning to the latter this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation
do you think that any of these issues could be included at least in the agenda of the current conference
mr solana i am sitting quite close to you close enough to see your face
i think that you have aged your face is quite lined
you are spanish you are from a large country mr solana
spain and franco were not one and the same
my first question mr solana will be simple and more direct perhaps than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me
you know the french proverb nothing for nothing 
could they for example have a place at least as observers in the different political and security committees or in the military committee
thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with mr gilrobles
i will give you an example
this house is rather doubtful about this and i am not sure whether you share this doubt
mr solana it has been said many times in this house that prevention is better than cure
in any case it is prevention that i would like to discuss today
war is threatening to break out again in the gulf
today we have the chance to prevent it tomorrow it may be too late
as we sit here hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in mozambique
this has not just happened
the flooding has been going for weeks and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need
the level of practical assistance from the community and from the member states has been pathetic
these are of long standing but are being addressed already within nato
nato is largely european
now what has happened and what is still happening in chechnya is similar to genocide
how can we describe the rapes the looting the deliberate fires the deportations which are called cleansing  that recall the worst episodes of the middle ages in europe
what about the infrastructures
is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy
will current programmes continue to be implemented
has any thought been given to the matter
has it been discussed
i hope this is not an omen for this sintra agreement
that said i would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far
we have all heard some of the tales emanating from the council of ministers building in brussels
and indeed some member states are not geared for mobility
they are very static in their military forces and unsuitable for this sort of warfare
we cannot leave it simply to governments
i strongly support the decisions taken at sintra
they constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective european security and defence policy
i am anxious to know how effective the eu s policy planning and early warning unit has been
i would also like to support mr titley s comments on an effective role for the parliament in this whole area
what we need are   civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations
we have not heard any information from mr solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to russia and chechnya
we have large gaps in what we are arguing for in principle in relation to human rights
so i would ask mr solana to explain to this house the position of the european union in relation to chechnya
what are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end
meetings are all very well but it is the result that counts
if we look around the reality is that the cfsp is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk take for example germany s defence savings
i am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the high representative
i would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject
this was particularly true with some of the american delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well

it is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner
but that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in kosovo
we have armed forces we have all got experience of training community police officers
what is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing
so again rhetoric and reality
but perhaps i could just say one or two things this afternoon
all those things come together
we will be producing a communication on antipersonnel landmines actually the use of sensor equipment
the work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in mozambique
they have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools
what does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days moving those antipersonnel mines around
we are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise
what we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere
so the point i want to make is that all these things are intimately related
now i hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric

i would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the european council the general affairs council and ecofin
i have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern caucuses
i have heard promises that we will secure democracy in indonesia by giving more assistance to indonesia
where is the beef
and that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy
that is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view
thank you very much commissioner patten
women in the decisionmaking process
the next item is the declarations by the council and the commission on women in the decisionmaking process
two centuries later we have achieved a great deal in europe
the last century was marked by three periods
this was followed by a second period in which the worth of female models was recognised
there were women everywhere
prime ministers members of parliament ministers in the professional arena doctors lawyers pilots generals
for the first time in finland the women candidates outnumbered the men
and a woman was elected
we must congratulate prime minister jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner
a great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the member states
but the figures tell the true story
and the figures still give europe cause for concern
the number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small
what we need therefore is to promote specific policies
we need organisation and statistical monitoring
we need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture mentality and specific problems of each area
and of course these policies need a budget they need to be given financial teeth
my contacts with large european and multinational companies in europe have brought tragic results to light
nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decisionmaking centres
as you know europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within
no one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say
and at the level of the european union the question of whether the  member states need to be represented on every committee will never be asked
i should like to be absolutely categorical
there should be no reservation no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power
applause
women make up half the population half the strength of the planet
excluding women from the centres of power means first democratic failure and secondly underexploitation of human resources
i am optimistic that we shall succeed
the bet before us is a bet with time
future generations of women must not be sidelined
if need be we must use all possible means to force the situation
applause
we are convinced that the participation of women in the decisionmaking process will be beneficial to society as a whole
the real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women
there is no clear agreement within the ppede group in support of the compulsory quota system
some members have even come out against this
this is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference
it could hardly have been made more abundantly clear what we are concerned with here
i am convinced that it will be hard work when all is said and done
if the commissioner asks for support from parliament she can in any case count upon the support of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
that is absolutely crucial
it should also be remembered however that no one voluntarily relinquishes power and that applies to both men and women
inevitably we should like for the same reasons of power politics to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves
what i want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides surrendering power
just for the record i would say that she might well also have mentioned denmark
and i say that of course because i come from denmark
in fact  of the danish government is made up of women and that is in reality a touch more than in finland
i should like to broach some of the points the commissioner mentioned notably the question of financial resources
in the short term we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and of course also properly educated
the issue is therefore one of appropriate structures
in denmark we have in any case seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up
there are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which i should just like to mention here finally
the first is the issue of the media s influence
i think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish
do we have a special problem in this regard
i have to say that i do not know the precise answer to that question
i have a suspicion that this is the case but i am not certain
the second point is the enlargement of the union
it is systematic monitoring which will reveal this
mainstreaming is a longterm commitment and process
in the meantime we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures
in  a woman s right to vote was on the agenda
today we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decisionmaking process
women are no homogenous collective
women belong to different social classes
women have different individual needs and interests
what happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making
when the talk turns to quota allocation by gender the word qualifications also crops up
what is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined
it often looks as if men today as in the past always have the least defined qualifications
being a man therefore seems in itself to be synonymous with maximum competence
this way of seeing things i consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today s decision makers
earlier this year we requested here in this chamber that  march be made into an international holiday
we do not have any such officers but black grandmothers are in fact to be found
undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics
it is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible
in france  of elected representatives are town councillors
the vast majority of them are not members of any party
in the authorities of the french departments the leading french party is that of independent elected representatives in rightwing or leftwing categories
in order to be elected as a local councillor you just have to want to be elected
but access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates
our group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the european union
with such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions
it would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation
on the other hand such a policy shows a deep contempt for women
ladies have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota
women deserve more than a quota
therefore commissioner you can go ahead
you do not need to wait for a new amendment to the treaty
no action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a european framework status for assistant spouses
here again commissioner the ball is in your court
do not take too long to send it back
the presence of women in decisionmaking bodies in particular is a question of democracy
all citizens both men and women should be able to see to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule
women work an average of  hours a week which is  hours longer than men
if this is true and it is any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point
much has been achieved on many issues in europe but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation
mr president before i came here for today s sitting i was watching finnish television
in finland an honorary company of the finnish army was saluting the new president of the republic with the words good morning madam president
finally i would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference
it is quite logical it is consistent
so there should be no positive discrimination to include women
woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense
when i see that we are asking for training for women in politics i want to say  no definitely not
let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics  but why especially compel women to undergo training
that simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority
but i do know that we have never felt inferior to men particularly in politics
but when it comes to important decisions and priorities there is a lack of women s voices
that is unacceptable in a democracy
if we are to achieve a balance a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required
i am therefore delighted that the commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind
the latter are consequently accorded low priority and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted
not to use women s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste
mr president i would like to congratulate the presidentinoffice of the council and commissioner diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today
we have high hopes for what you will achieve
we know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for
the lisbon summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women
the rate of employment in europe which is much lower than in the united states and japan must be increased
i think this is a very sad state of affairs
it appears that the meritocracy in a number of our european countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance
this is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas
indeed minister we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract
but we should draw the necessary conclusions from this
i would suggest the following where possible apply it on a voluntary basis where there is reluctance impose it
mr president why do women need their rightful share in political decision making
and how should we achieve this
we all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary
it is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and as such a condition for political legitimacy
but if we look into how to achieve this the opinions are greatly divided
and is it then up to the state in other words the legislative to impose such measures on political parties
or should we even consider a system in which  of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies
in my opinion the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level
like mrs van lancker i am a product of such a measure
we would in this way violate democracy
the problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decisionmaking centres
the debate is a deeply political one
there are two approaches
the first is a policy of persuasion
gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved
three comments the first is based on the fact that women are able i can therefore all women can
how do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded
we are able but the rest of the female population is not
here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics because women have to deal with different realities
because they have fewer opportunities
because they have a different level of education
the second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders
not necessary
they have all been persuaded
there is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women
there is not one party from the far left to the far right which does not stress the need for women to take part
on paper
thirdly we must expect things to change gradually
the women s conference in beijing brought an important point to light
with the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level it will take  years to achieve a balance between men and women
the second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women
quotas alone are not enough
if only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history
on this we are clear
quotas are one of the ways one of the policies needed to bring about change
thank you mrs diamantopoulou
i have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow morning
floods in mozambique
the next item is the commission statement on flooding in mozambique
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission
the commission is following with very great concern as i know all honourable members will be the emergency situation in mozambique
several people have lost their lives many have disappeared many have been injured
the government of mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries
mr nielson will be happy to report back to parliament on the findings of his mission
just before i say a word about the assistance which has been given by echo so far perhaps i can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks
if ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was mozambique
let me turn to the assistance provided so far
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of commissioner nielson
it is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to reconstruction within a three to four years time horizon
there have already been hundreds of deaths
we must be aware of the aftermath of the floods
if nothing is done now we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help mozambique in its development go to waste
they urgently need aid such as food water and shelter in order to survive
this immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics which have apparently already broken out and aid for reconstruction
helicopters are therefore needed
apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about   people from trees
the machinery mobilising the aid is too slow
i must remind you in particular of the efforts of mr rocard during the previous term
however africa is surprisingly not included in the dipecho plans
the dipecho agenda includes southeast asia central america and the caribbean
the pse group has always supported the commission s humanitarian aid policy
the eur  million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the mozambican government at  million dollars
the time has also come to demand greater efficiency
mr president the situation in mozambique is of the greatest urgency
each day each hour of delay costs many lives
there are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims the water levels continue to rise
starvation and epidemics seem inevitable
it is as if the whole world is looking on helplessly
the question is whether the commission has reacted with sufficient alertness
i must admit that i have my doubts about this
unlike a number of member states the european union has promised only very limited aid so far
what options does the commission have to offer effective help fast
what could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of
can commissioner patten update us on the international coordination so far
why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner
mr president all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting mozambique
it is therefore vital for the eu and its member states to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help
we know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation representatives of the portuguese presidency and commissioner nielson left today for mozambique
thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment and only international solidarity can save them
i would like to think that the eu is up to the task of providing the people of mozambique with what they expect from us
this would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all

children have lost parents families are bereft hopeless helpless and they have lost absolutely everything
this morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the gaza region
the save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet
 of the work is within an hour of maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is
also i would like to say commissioner that european citizens want to know exactly what echo is doing
most of us here would not wish to boast about eur  million
clearly also we need to see a massive airlift
as you say tons of food water purification equipment tents blankets
are we ready to pay for those resources
mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured
thank you mrs kinnock
the debate is closed
union economy 
this is the challenge
such an attitude has downside risks which i understand the ecofin council is currently discussing
it has been my proposal that parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts
this was the first pillar of my recommendation
unfortunately my colleagues of the people s party aided and abetted by the liberals in the economic affairs committee found my approach unacceptable
the report which has come to you from the economic committee sins in all these respects
instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee
moreover several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus
however we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the european internal market which still has some serious flaws
we therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention
this is the objective in respect of which he called upon the european parliament give hope to the people of europe
there is indeed economic recovery but it only marginally reduces unemployment in europe
the votes of the ppede and the liberals have very considerably diminished and even reversed the meaning of his message
what are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report
mr president i think that this policy will engender not hope but deep disappointment in european workers
our group categorically condemns this perception and in this sense does not intend to support this resolution
it will be voting against it
we are well aware of these handicaps which must be remedied urgently  the structural inflexibility the excessive mandatory levies
but let us not forget that there is another one a new handicap with the single currency
this unification is considered to be positive by the commission s report
but in reality we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation
mr president the present draft resolution is controversial given the topic it covers this is hardly surprising
it is after all a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things especially where the future is concerned
even if he advocates sustainable growth sustainability does not come into it
given the environmental and demographic developments if anything we ought to encourage member states to pursue a selective economic growth policy
more investments production and consumption only generate shortlived prosperity
the use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced
other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes
an appeal in favour of a more proactive government policy comes across as very odd
what the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and mediumsized enterprises in particular
promoting employment however is a longwinded affair and comes under structural policy
member states in particular should adopt an effective policy
in order to achieve this they must be given the necessary leeway
however shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution
what did mr katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report
he proposed an ambitious report based on an optimistic europe which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve
and europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets
we therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive
as has been advocated for the lisbon summit we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training
we also need investment to grow at a faster rate
we are all familiar with the idea advocated by mr von wogau according to which what we need is a flexible workforce
what we want therefore is for europe to enjoy economic growth but also be prepared to address social issues
mr president like many others i want to thank mr katiforis for an interesting report
investment levels are too low unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth
the rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself which is something i agree with
there is far too much talk about stability convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development
my conclusions about this differ completely however from those of the previous speaker
instead you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the member states
in terms of outlook the document points to an upswing to longterm prospects and the measures required to achieve this which karl von wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon
i am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy
it is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment
but you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year
eleven thousand job losses at hoechst and rhonepoulenc twenty two thousand at unilever ten thousand at abbalsthom power not to mention all the others
this is the key ideological struggle for europe facing us
this debate i think has summed it up
this report is a wakeup call to europe
this report recommends radical measures which in essence will make it easier to employ people
it is as simple as that
this report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that because europe has to wake up
it cannot create jobs just by government spending
the real world simply does not work like that
it is this absence of management of the european economy which is responsible my dear mr von wogau for the fall of the euro
mr president mr katiforis s report is exciting
the debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this
we have that opportunity right now let us grasp it
i would like to say that i strongly disagree with mrs villiers view that this is such an interesting debate
it would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision
the portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in lisbon
the commission has done this in its fiveyear plan by listing one of the four priorities
the commission document too which is being drafted for the summit in lisbon takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas
are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions
 es mr president ladies and gentlemen firstly i must thank this house for its serious and detailed work
however i believe that there are also some elements of consensus
we all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good
employment is growing at a good rate
when we submitted our report we referred to the risks posed by growth
parliament s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets
the commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem
anyway we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more
we need public and private investment
what policy should we use to achieve these objectives
in our opinion the union s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs
the policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed
we must define a macroeconomic policy which aids growth
this is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth s sake
this policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth
firstly private investment must be assisted
our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital
these are two of the principal challenges for the lisbon summit
this is the policy which the commission has defended and will continue to defend in lisbon
common fisheries policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
so is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other
i understand that they have been some five years in their gestation
with the review of the common fisheries policy due in  it is important that swift progress is now made
both biological and economic information are included
the proposal also makes provision for member states to produce such data in aggregated form
exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation
the implementing regulation will establish a minimum community programme and an extended community programme
it also allows the commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects
two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the committee
the first relates to the degree of involvement of the commission
the original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations
the commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one
since however the community is funding the exercise it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment
this change is taken in conjunction with amendments nos   and 
amendment no  makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally
amendment no  calls on the commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation
the other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation
first in respect to economic data amendment no  makes two changes
one attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued
in conjunction with these changes amendment no  deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly
secondly in respect to the environmental data the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information
the commission has however made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind
it has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by member states at a later stage
amendment no  brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems
this will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary
it merely permits the commission to do so should it so wish
as already stated the proposal for the council decision falls into two parts
the first is concerned with financing the member states in implementing the community programmes
the second is to allow the commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects
amendments nos  and  aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority
this provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available
my group has included two reasonable requests
as a result this report is very satisfactory and on behalf of my group i therefore ask for its approval
i wish at the outset to congratulate mrs attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report
i agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the commission
sound factual information is in the best interests of the industry
we are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice
what is more the movement of fish is like co or like capital it is not european but worldwide
for if we must preserve the shoals of fish we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen
the northern ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this union
that is scandalous their case ought to be heard
it should be put on record and i want to put it on record today
it should be pointed out that not all the member states have the same amount of data
these deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly
we must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data
some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises
i too want to congratulate mrs attwooll and say that i agree with most of what she said
in the past somebody said to me i have been defending the decisions the commission makes
we are also of the opinion that community funds should be set aside to fund these activities
a case in point is the mediterranean including my country s fishing industry
a subsequent regulation regulation  adopted not by chance in  permitted certain exemptions in particular for special cases
the time period will elapse on  may next to be precise when the commission will present a proposal
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
combating certain fish diseases
although the virus has been found in other species the disease itself is so far confined to salmon
it sustains some   jobs and generates around eur  million annually
the intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate isa and to do so as quickly as possible
the proposed changes are twofold the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle
i therefore support the commission s proposed changes and i am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation
i am opposing amendments  to  which were decisively rejected by the fisheries committee
most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text
these amendments by the green component of the greenseuropean free alliance group are designed to provide justification for amendment 
in scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective
it is in all of our interests to ensure that in scotland too we contain isa and prevent its further spread
i congratulate mr hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable members of parliament to do likewise
so i thoroughly recommend and hope that the parliament will support this excellent report
i would like to thank the rapporteur mr hudghton also for this report
scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the european union and accommodates  of the british aquacultural industry
the industry is located in some of europe s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities
in recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth eur  million per annum and   jobs rely on its existence
the example of norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach
this is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming
this infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon causing death
for the others well we would have time to see what would happen according to local circumstances
i think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way
what about women
nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard
there is another risk to the environment as well because this disease is transmitted to wild fish as we have seen
this is a community policy which will effect ireland as well  where i am from  should similar unfortunate events occur
and people have spoken in the past about bse
for many years the greens were calling for the bse issue to be addressed
so it also has to do with environmental protection
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health
however this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating isa
nor can it be done if the proposal involves a threat to public health
the environmental implications must also be taken very seriously
i am advised that isa is considered nonpathogenic for humans and mammals
the disease exists since  and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals
the virus harms coldblooded animals
in no way however can diseased fish be used for human consumption
as an extra precaution i am validating this advice to our scientific committee
i deeply regret the losses suffered by the scottish salmon industry
council decision  constitutes another instrument for community financial support in case of disease outbreaks
i must emphasise however that there are serious constraints
budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set
so further thought is necessary
this is in particular the case for amendments nos  and 
i am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance
the commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon
the intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations
i believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in amendment no 
experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers
those could perpetuate an infection
i therefore am not able to accept amendment no 
you also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease
i will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals
i also can partly accept the part of amendment no  saying that directive  should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence
as i pointed out earlier the available scientific evidence is that isa is not a threat to health
in this context a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open
it is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of isa is needed
i also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate
bearing this in mind i can agree to accept amendment nos  and  with a minor change to the latter
i do not feel in a position to accept amendments nos  and 
it is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk
i believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned
i can partly accept amendment no 
i believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward
we remain committed to eradicating the disease an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmonfarming sector
i hope that in accepting our proposal the european parliament acknowledges our commitment and i would be very grateful for that
thank you very much commissioner byrne
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
protection of juvenile marine organisms
the proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one
the body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks
these panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention
proposals made by the panels are then presented to the commission and the commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties
these conditions are binding however contracting parties may lodge objections within a sixmonth period
the european union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in community law
iccat also made recommendations in   and 
as of now it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is  in weight terms  less than  kilos
the information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans
it is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations
 percent of it was landed by purse seine
i do not suppose that anybody in this house would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms
all laudable stuff
there can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance
i do not know what the metric equivalent is
so i support the findings of iccat and i support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues
my concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst rome burns
the common fisheries policy is not working
for all of the highminded talk about conservation the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster
in mixed fisheries you cannot discriminate
the sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless
from a uk perspective there is also a deepseated political objection to the cfp
many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it
let me illustrate this with a topical example
in february commission regulation  designed to protect irish sea cod stocks was issued
it means that in fleetwood  inshore boats are tied up until the end of april
the scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done
our rapporteur s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded
i cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time
however i must again congratulate our rapporteur mr gallagher
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
fishing and the environment bergen  march  nd report
this is the basis of my request to the european commission and the services of this house
these initiatives together with effective systems of control are the key aspects for the future of fisheries
i am referring to this now because i will not have time to speak later on
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
the problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this house many times in the past
i understand i have been described in a spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because i have said such things
this is an unwise policy
all of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the community level and in the various international fora in which the community participates
they should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the community negotiates
one can quote from the communication
overexploitation is so severe in community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to  percent
that appeared in the communication published last july
these are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to overexploitation
what can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities
the first consideration must be to recognise that community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced
secondly the principles of such community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the community is a party
recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas
such pressures are greatest in europe
a quota management system such as that existing in new zealand since  is one possible alternative
the property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish  not the fish themselves
such a market organisation can reap better longterm prospects for the fishing industry
the fishery sectors in europe face serious problems and i am a great supporter of the fishery sector
i recommend the report to the house
after all the treaties have stipulated since  that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into community policies
the un fish stocks agreement of  would serve as a very good model in this regard
one aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report
the relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious
yet it is very wideranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport
to blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong
just when we thought the discussions had ended a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which i ask you to vote against unreservedly
according to these for example the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea
maritime transport employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment
as for the structural funds certain examples could be mentioned but i will leave this for another day
the european parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries
as mr katiforis says discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept
twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back
the fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear
we socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector
it is therefore essential that the commission launches an information campaign on the cfp with this message
without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity
mr president i very much appreciate this report by mr katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
we should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity but also from domestic activity
they say that if you want something done it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea the fishermen must be very attentive
so we must practise selective fishing
aquaculture should also be monitored
let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment
ladies and gentlemen i would ask you to come and take part in this discussion
i would like to touch briefly on these amendments
in effect this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management
and just as well in my view
lastly we would vote for the amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left
there is therefore a need for an indepth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment
firstly fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin
this particularly applies however to our own coastal waters
given this context i would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago
can i first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report
conservation is something that i hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it
a lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep
it is all very well to talk about conservation and i agree with it totally
in actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense without any real negotiation or discussion
it has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an  to  week period
it does not matter whether you come from galicia it does not matter whether you are from northern ireland or whether you are from scotland
that chasm exists and we in brussels have not been able to cross that divide
and we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
bankruptcy procedures
mr president i think we all agree that a european legal area must be created
we therefore all agree on the established facts and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction
if i may however just make a few comments on the method
that is not the route that has been taken
this is a good thing moreover and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for
but at this stage i should like to make an observation which is not technical but more philosophical and taken from practice
today in many member states that is not possible
i consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard
i congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report
for better or for worse the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life
this is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy
the commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the convention
as far back as  the commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings
consequently the commission has refrained from presenting an amendment instead it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues
the commission therefore accepts amendments nos    and  proposed by the rapporteur mr lechner
on the other hand it does not accept amendment no 
in all other cases that have not been specifically addressed we feel that the reference made in recital  should be sufficient
thank you very much commissioner vitorino
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am

shipwreck of the erika
our president told us yesterday that the commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments
there are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue
enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event
we must now get down to adopting measures commissioner
we expect concrete action from the european commission the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of brittany and the vendee are particularly important welldeveloped and prestigious
how can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained
how can those affected be compensated
we must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future
this is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the committee on fisheries
we hope to hear specific proposals from the commission with plenty of action and no more regrets
with   tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel the situation could still deteriorate
the main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature which is nowadays too often being punished by man s activities
these events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities
prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes
surely the budget would agree as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these
mr fischler says that he always comes to the house when asked
galicia and brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks
please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this
the polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate
my message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support
i wish to put two questions to the commissioner
the erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that white paper is seeking to address
this question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future
we are pleased to hear the commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation and for this to be backdated
we further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats
this means that the   tonnes of cargo released into the sea include  tonnes of highly toxic products
a great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation
solutions cannot be found at the last minute when the disaster is already in progress
consequently the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand
mr president over two months after the wreck of the erika pollution of the coasts which have already been cleaned once is still continuing
we must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution
the french state has released funds for compensating damage
i feel however that the european union has so far not actually come up with any expression of community solidarity at the requisite level
cakes of tar are still washing in along  km of the atlantic coastline on a daily basis
curiously the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified
the ecological disaster is a major one possibly unprecedented in scale
all workers in the fishing fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard
the chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in europe
the frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the vendee and loireatlantique regions
as regards fishing proper passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit
after shellfish the slump is now affecting crustacean sales
the two principle resources of the atlantic shore fishing and tourism both closely interrelated have both been seriously affected
there is a danger that the season will be lost resulting in an extremely serious crisis by the end of the year
the fact that parliament is presenting a new resolution one to which our group has made a significant contribution is therefore perfectly justifiable
it emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level
the first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full
the second principle is the polluter pays principle
according to our resolution the polluter s liability must extend to fishing fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses
if the fipol ceiling is insufficient and it has clearly been underestimated then it must be raised
our resolution calls for this
if the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance
commissioner the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at european level
mr fischler has just told us that he would welcome france s requests i am pleased to hear it
we must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution
this time we must not let inertia win the day
mr president the economy of the western atlantic coastline has been devastated polluted by oil from the erika
finally the commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for natural disasters involving member states  and make the regions affected eligible for structural funds
what is the commission s view of these proposals
what decisions has the commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take
how did the commission follow up the resolution which the european parliament adopted on  january 
we have not thus far seen any practical action whatsoever
there are two aspects the first being the environmental angle
these spills in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage have devastated local industries
effective compensation is essential
the companies responsible the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence
we must learn from past experience and make sure that the industries affected by the braer spill can be rebuilt
parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster
generally it puts forward positive technical measures some of which are adopted in directives
if they were applied they would in fact serve to counter the idea of cutting costs to the minimum a policy which is maintained through flags of convenience
and by way of an indication  is caused by natural pollution
i would like to advocate this
i want to thank commissioner fischler for his answer to the oral question tabled by our committee he has given us some important information
this is the right way to go
i have received  motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am
ecisrael trade agreement
it is very simple but in this world the simplest things are very often the hardest things to achieve
i will mention but a few which are produced in the golan heights and the occupied territories wine and other products
i shall try to provide you with the additional information you are now seeking on this matter
this issue is highly sensitive in as far as it relates to the broader question of borders to israelis and palestinians alike
hence the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system
he said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues
the union has played an invaluable part in this process in its capacity as the primary source of economic aid to the region
the israeli interpretation is not the same as the union s as the commissioner mentioned
at all events it is a process currently under negotiation a difficult one but one that we all wish to see succeed
the settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue ie that of dialogue
a tripartite working group comprising palestinian and israeli specialists as well as those of the commission should thus be set up
we therefore have some expertise to bring to bear on the subject and we are particularly well placed to gauge the extent of what has already been achieved
hopefully the israelis and palestinians will demonstrate the same optimistic faith in goodwill
mr president commissioner the peace process in the middle east is an extremely delicate matter
in addition there is a significant connection between the economic activities within israel and those on palestinian territory
potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference
mr president in general terms this house shares the concern expressed in mrs morgantini s question
this in my opinion is the lesson to be learned from such a longdrawnout affair
mr president commissioner it is true that the present trade agreement between israel and the ec is ambiguous
it is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question
i can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon
there are nonetheless a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration
indeed we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered
israel and the palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders
i am pleased that the commissioner shares this view
there seems to be remarkable consensus in the house today but i would like to make a few points
here in the parliament trade in the middle east has always been a political flashpoint
borders are being shut down sometimes arbitrarily and sometimes following a terrorist attack
but it is not just an issue of closed borders
goods do flow freely from these territories goods produced in israeli settlements in the occupied territories
we have an international agreement and it is being transgressed
it is our responsibility to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and upheld by all
i have a couple of questions commissioner
and is the commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not
it is in fact an international agreement and a trade agreement
mr president it is universally recognised that rules must be observed
it is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules
everyone understands that there is concern about this today but i would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable
nor would i like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment
the oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both israel and the palestinian authority
secondly nowhere in the agreements between israel and the european union are the frontiers of the state of israel defined
the negotiations in progress between israel and the palestinian authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers
it is complicated it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from
there is i think one final reason why the commission should be supported
we are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement
mr president it is of course unacceptable for breaches of our trade agreement with israel to be concealed or tolerated
the choice ought to be simple
the commission must guarantee that these things will be done
commissioner vitorino s contribution offered some hope that they would be
the peace process in the middle east must be given a chance
it can only be founded upon international law
it is the eu s responsibility to contribute to this
and what the population of the region is interested in above all is peace and their own economic prosperity

 attwooll report a
we know that the commission is going to reform the common fisheries policy shortly
this proposal for a council regulation is the first in a series which will make it possible to draw up this reform
the collection and management of the fisheries data is needed to conduct the common fisheries policy
the text of the proposal for a regulation has been amended quite extensively in the committee on fisheries
all the members of our group voted in favour of these amendments both in committee and in parliament
amendment no  serves to clarify the text considerably
specifically the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use
scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decisionmaking authorities
it is however crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner
amendment no  amends the initial commission proposal
what the commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses
regarding the second part of this amendment it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly
amendment no  makes it possible to add an important aspect the collection of environmental data
amendment no  serves to mitigate the commission proposal
amendment no  is intended to tighten up the commission s participation in the inspection procedure
it is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results
finally amendment no  requires the commission to produce a report by the end of the year 
hudghton report a
it is a waterborne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood faecal matter mucus etc
there is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe
it is however recognised that other species such as trout eels or herring may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it
the disease was detected in norway in  and also in canada 
the virus does not survive at a temperature of more than o c and is therefore not dangerous to humans
the disease chiefly affects the scottish salmon industry
it was detected in this region in may 
today  salmon farms are affected by isa
the council proposal envisages setting up a system for the gradual elimination of fish affected by the disease and also a vaccination plan
we can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish
as regards vaccination we should remember that the initial directive prohibited the use of vaccines against isa
the usefulness of this proposal is limited to say the least certainly in the short term
canada does have a vaccine with a  success rate
resolution on women in decision making b
my group abstained in the resolution on women in decision making much to our regret
but even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions
nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas
we look forward to that
we have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits they should be
underrepresentation of women in politics for example continues to be the norm
the importance of enabling greater numbers of women to become involved in politics is however recognised
only women are in a position to come up with policies likely to change structures which have been developed by men for men
it is thus up to the european political parties to make themselves more accessible to women
a condition of this type may have no legal value but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value
it gives political parties an important role in building a democratic europe
in the  european elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented
this is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely
moreover this parliament has had a woman president since the  elections
i shall conclude by repeating the conclusions of the conference organised by the commission in april  entitled women and men in power 
 some progress has been made recently in increasing the number of women present in decisionmaking bodies around the union
in our own institution  of elected representatives are now women including the president of the european parliament itself
finland too has just elected a female president
on average one quarter of member state governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments
this oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men s work more than women s
what is more women bear the main responsibility for family matters
women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men
mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace
states must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers
finally in order to enable everyone men and women to become involved in public life working hours must be drastically reduced
we need real equality between men and women in political economic and social life
we are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems
she achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against allcomers
katiforis report a
and so we now have no resources left to pay pensions
we need a completely different system
 fr i shall begin first of all by warmly congratulating mr katiforis on the audacity of his proposals
some measures particularly on tax must be adopted to encourage private and public investment
some measures such as retraining in the form of lifelong training seem particularly relevant
these must be an integral part of the ongoing institutional transformation which must support the transition to a knowledgebased economy
all of these measures which are too proactive in the eyes of some of those on the right have of course been brushed aside
i must condemn this
an amendment referring to taxation on speculative capital transfers also suffered the same fate
 fr our position is determined by the nature of our project for europe
the resolution turns its back on such an approach
the freemarketeering right s rejection of the proposed amendments leads us therefore to vote against the resolution
 sv we have chosen to abstain in the vote on amendment  to the katiforis report on the eu economy 
joint resolution on the shipwreck of the rc b
mr president we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster
we do however deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution
it is disgusting to see total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities
confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue
legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter
this is the seventh time that brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the torrey canyon shipwreck
no other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea
the draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect and our group has therefore given it its full backing
we do already know however that it will be extensive
every day further pollution increases the toll
the degradation does not affect just business turnover but also valuable parts of our heritage
the effect upon the brand image of seafood products is hard to calculate today
hence the need to clearly stipulate as our resolution does the principle of polluter cleans and the principle of polluter pays 
this is just scandalous
quite obviously all victims should receive  compensation
everyone must play their own part
let me remind you that the erika was registered in valletta
the most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties
katiforis report a
we agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment
hence the importance of our amendments which sought to achieve this

effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible
food safety with regard to seafood is also of prime importance
that concludes the vote
adjournment of the session
the session is adjourned
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on  march 
there was a grave danger of this house s reputation being damaged
you see it emerged that during the plenary partsessions there is a significant rise in prostitution in the area in strasbourg
thank you mrs groner
i fully agree with your remarks and have even been proactive in responding to your wishes
i will of course keep you updated on the reply that mr ries is bound to send me
we get bad news in these points of order very often but i have very good news for our dutch colleagues
they now have two television channels
applause and laughter the quaestors are working hard on their behalf and we are waiting for the finnish television channel
we have two german channels as well so happy viewing everybody
i hope you enjoy it
i am absolutely delighted mrs banotti and think that the members concerned should thank our quaestors wholeheartedly
madam president i would simply like to add to what mrs groner has said
you will be aware that terrible things happen to these women that they are tortured and their families threatened
it is not only in strasbourg that this happens
thank you mrs roure for this additional information
we will assess the situation when in brussels too and then see what should be done
madam president i would like to talk about a quite different matter which concerns iran
thank you mr jonckheer
i will happily comply with your request
madam president i do not think that mrs banotti should be cockahoop today because she has laid on two dutch tv channels
it would have been better if she had obtained channels in all languages
i hope we shall be getting a danish channel next time
thank you mr blak
as you can see mrs banotti you still have your work cut out for you
i too would like to say thank you for the fact that here we can watch a finnish television channel
i hope that we will also be getting a picture on the finnish language television channel and not just the sound
then i would like to say thank you for the fact that we have got cold water in the taps
back home we also have hot water but at least it is good to have some water
thank you mr seppanen
special european council  march  in lisbon
it is my great pleasure to give the floor to the prime minster antonio guterres
we fully approve of the breakdown he presented to us which received such an ovation and we support his initiative
together we can make the lisbon summit a success
now is the time to do this because there is currently a good chance of succeeding
in addition to this we are facing a social challenge the need to fight unemployment and social exclusion
our summit will therefore be on sustainable development and employment
we have been through a tough period but i can assure you that there is nothing unrealistic in this goal
human resources mean education training and reform of the welfare state in order to deal in particular with the problem of an ageing society
these are operational points which cannot be dismissed
we must mobilise individual citizens local authorities national governments businesses and trade unions
as president guterres said the main goal of lisbon will be to set up this network
we must disseminate best practice in all fields and endeavour to advance it at european level
i would like to raise a few issues from our perspective
despite the diverse nature of these processes they must have one common purpose to improve people s quality of life in the union
we do not need new organisations new working parties or new fora to achieve this objective however
the tools are surely known to all
often however national considerations and sometimes ideological resistance also mean that these tools do not get used
a basis for all this is created through education and training and research however
we have to consider in particular the future creation and maintenance of resources in promising sectors in terms of employment
there are two issues that must be emphasised both by us and the commission and the council and we must always draw attention to them
the modernisation of the european social model and its increased effectiveness are as important for our competitiveness as the corresponding modernisation of the economy
the commission refers appropriately in my opinion to deficits that hinder the growth of employment in the union
we might mention the skills deficit as one example
some are suggesting importing a trained elite into the union area
i would ask whether this would be fair to countries less developed than ours as this would create a brain drain for them
madam president today s debate is welcome necessary and timely
that is a practical measure of the potential if we can get the policies and methods right
too many of our european markets are still too fragmented
not enough european small and mediumsized enterprises grow into worldbeaters
there are too few entrepreneurs in europe there is too little enterprise in europe
we undertake too little research and development individually as states and collectively as europe
where we do too little of it is converted into market product and services
the lisbon challenge is to delineate policy and methods for redressing these deficiencies and to release this potential dynamic
this truly would be an enabling exercise
if we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion
mr baron crespo has described it as a social democrat project
i am moved to describe it myself rather as an enlightened liberal project
it is a trap
it is very clear that we need to convert old social spending methods into new economic and social opportunity
we can do that by enabling europe and its peoples to achieve our full potential
we would like to believe this but we cannot
why
because we know that the new economy will of course foster the emergence of new jobs for creative staff for it staff
lastly we know that anyone who claims to meet the needs of the citizens must first ensure their total involvement in public policy decisions
we know all of this
in short we have heard nothing to suggest that the citizen will be anything more than a customer
we have heard nothing to suggest that opting for sustainable development would be a guiding factor in longawaited growth
it is our opinion that it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs but that it is also possible to do so
it is necessary because employment and i mean quality employment with employee rights is a fundamental right of every human being
it is crucial for us to abandon this monetarist and antisocial approach and put humans at the heart of our priorities and policies
we reached joint conclusions on  points of which we will officially inform the presidency
but we must surely oppose some of your policies some of your principles and a certain economic fundamentalism
you declare yourselves to be concerned at the fate of the millions of poor and unemployed whose situation your policies have in fact done much to create
unfortunately nothing is changing and nothing is going to change
it is our obligation to put europeans first when it comes to employment social protection policies relating to the family and retirement policy
your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable
you are thus acting as accomplices in this process
mr president the lisbon summit will produce a further string of fine words to dazzle us with
there is no requirement that unemployment should be below  or  better still  below  or 
it is public consumption and the price of money which definitely must not rise
you might think that a country would wish to limit unemployment by means of public investment but that is prohibited
it is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed
in  we had  unemployment both in denmark and in the eleven countries of the good old eu
between  and  unemployment in denmark fell to  in the eu it increased to 
in denmark we have had combined growth of  compared with  in the eu
i believe that the eu s prime ministers ought to study the danish example when they meet for their teteatete on the economy in lisbon
we need a change to the emu treaty instead of a further string of fine words directed at the unemployed
this concerns the most serious political problem we have had to face in recent times  the problem of austria
from this point of view this question is perfectly sensible and requires the clearest possible answer
that is my first question
my second question is about the employment summit
mr presidentinoffice you concluded on a vaguely ideological note which is fair enough
this is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledgebased economy of the future
furthermore the way in which this european council is being prepared is a good illustration of this
firstly there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in january
then there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit
this shows that the portuguese government is preparing for this summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance
for years many people have said this was impossible that in modern society it would never again be possible
only in this way will it be able to match the degree of seriousness with which the presidency is preparing this special summit
i congratulate you mr presidentinoffice
in the same paper the commission also set the objective of mitigating the problems connected with poverty in europe over the next ten years
i think it is only right to place the emphasis on common objectives for countries actual policies in this area will and should be different from one another
you pointed out that there are fifteen different public opinions but in fact there are many more than that
there are after all huge differences within the member states
furthermore our public opinion threatens to become polarised as a result of globalisation
this is a very serious risk
in europe everyone should be able to keep up
every region should be able to keep up and everyone must be able to take part in the knowledgebased society
i would therefore advocate networking regions more so than a europe in which each member state stands on its own dignity
we need to structure the economy and the world of work in such a way that gainful employment becomes worthwhile
this policy will not allow you to keep your promise of full employment
this has cost jobs and the trend is continuing
as early as the midnineties mr bangemann promised a huge increase in jobs due to the information society
the result is sobering
that is why i believe that we need a different policy mix for a new policy of full employment
secondly it means a strategy to make drastic cuts in working time and redistribute work between men and women
mr president the european leaders will be primarily addressing three key issues when they meet in portugal later this month
the world is becoming a smaller place in terms of market access and the term global village is not out of place
it is clear that each country has different priorities in terms of the different economic sectors it wishes to protect
moreover initiatives to promote cultural and linguistic diversity in europe must continue to receive support
we must not build a europe of the haves and the havenots
despite satisfactory economic growth the drop in unemployment is stagnating
other member states are experiencing limited growth widespread unemployment and fixed prices
specific instruments such as interest rates and the exchange rate are no longer at our disposal
the fact that member states are at different stages within the economic cycle nonetheless requires measures specific to each member state
is the council acting upon this
and if so what measures does the council presidency have in mind
but is this reflected in the policy
has a decision been made in favour of selective growth in such policy
and are people prepared to allow the areas suffering high unemployment to benefit from this growth in labourintensive industries
it is important to take the work where unemployment is at its highest
this may result in the further depopulation of certain disadvantaged areas
mr president i would like to extend warm thanks to prime minister guterres for his account and the clarity of this account
my main question relating to this is what is actually new
what is new of course is social protection
i do wonder why public health cannot be mentioned in this respect
i went over your speech again in my mind and i think in actual fact that it contained one point which had a strong socioeconomic bias
it was the point in which the macroeconomy is arranged such that it will lead to employment
it is of course a fact that a sound macroeconomic policy will automatically result in an improvement in the employment situation
we have experienced this
but on the other hand the sound rule of macroeconomics should not be misused by pinning it down too much
this should not happen
finally mr president i have a problem with the portuguese presidency s documents and also to some extent but less so with the commission s documents
it is their defensive nature
so it is possible for europeans to match this
there are other countries which appeared far less capable of doing this
mr president prime minister guterres has been most convincing
the proposals made by the presidency mark a clean break from the usual community jargon
the citizens of europe do not want a theological debate they want to see tangible action
according to professor fitousi the most serious deficit currently threatening european society is the deficit of the future
many of our fellow citizens are fearful of a future that been starkly portrayed to them for the past two decades
the most minor of accidents is depicted as an irreparable ecological disaster
science is often demonised with the result that fewer and fewer young people choose to study science
people are asked to be flexible and to embark on the breakneck quest for productivity
europe has indeed become highly productive and would not otherwise be the world s leading exporter
nevertheless the predominant rhetoric always centres on wage restraint
according to current dogma salary increases must remain well below increases in productivity or inflation will rise again
it would seem that the exorbitant profits made in the casino that is the international finance market have no impact on inflation
i am not making the case against stability policies nor against necessary structural reforms
the completion of the internal market and the surplus of transparency and thus of competition stimulated by the euro mean that a good many adjustments will have to be made
new technologies will change the shape of a good many professions
electronic commerce will cut out many middlemen
the union has always succeeded when it has set itself hard and fast objectives
the president cut the speaker off i still have many points i would like to make
mr president we place our trust in you
mr president i should like to thank prime minister guterres for his very committed speech
the main message is that the individual should be at the centre of the eu s policies
we have our own approach in denmark as jenspeter bonde emphasised and other countries have theirs as has also been mentioned
another reason why i am saying this is that we ought to have something on the agenda in addition to comparisons with the united states
these proposals are not new but they are becoming more topical
why
or have industrialisation nuclear power and biotechnology led to greater justice in the past
i wonder what has happened to it
or has the evidence recently supplied of the echelon global bugging system already been forgotten
nonetheless there remains an imbalance in the programme about which i am concerned and which i want to talk about
my own experience of these industries however is that they are managing really rather well
in many cases they have far too much capital and in many cases they are spoiled
i have seen it companies which are unbelievably spoiled
above all integration mechanisms should be created
reading the preparatory documents gives rise to certain fears in this regard
but how can we guarantee greater convergence of all these vastly different processes
the conclusion of the document issued by the presidency on  january holds the key
it would appear that here one should take the word framework as having the dual meaning of synthesis and obligation 
mr president are we not with these blanket documents going down the path of reinventing the broad strategic guidelines
if we consider our gross national product that ought actually to be possible
we now need to ask ourselves why this is the case
of course there are sectors of the business world including the new media in which we occupy leading positions
here i need only mention mobile telephones
we have banned them here in the chamber rightly because they are instruments of torment
at the same time however they also make life much easier for many people because they create jobs
and in europe we are world leaders in this field
why
where then do europe s shortcomings actually lie
i believe that these observatories create a handful of jobs for officials but that they do not create any jobs in small and mediumsized enterprises
we in europe are deficient where training is concerned
europe lacks as has already been stated entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial spirit
there are too few young people who are willing to take the risk of being selfemployed
the way in which we structure our work and the way in which work is organised is not flexible enough
in europe we are also still a long way from a common domestic market
we have  domestic markets and a common european internal market
for electronic commerce we need common clear european rules
we need a european patent at a reasonable price we do not have that yet either
this european patent is so expensive that it is not competitive with other patents
we have a lot of europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and i wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening
there are many challenges involved with creating that full employment
this is the great challenge the great importance of lisbon
there are other areas that we must look at
one of these is the challenge of creating an eeurope which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside
i welcome the new strategic goal of making europe the most dynamic and competitive area
who could challenge such an ambition
i hope that we will achieve them but i sound a warning note
i note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace
i cannot help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted
actually i would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important
we live in the time of idea  the internet digital electronic age
that sums up what we are trying to achieve on the eside the electronic side of life
that must be right
we cannot just focus on the new economy we must pay attention to the old
i look forward to hearing more detail about the european charter for microenterprises  that should be very interesting when it comes forward
that has been achieved possibly beyond the wildest dreams of people a few months ago
mr presidentinoffice you have made us in the european parliament eager to leave for lisbon already
all of us can only hope that the special summit is able to live up to the high expectations which people have of it
reforms of financial services services capital and labour markets are certainly useful and necessary
we were forced to experience this several times in the nineties
this scenario has moved into the foreseeable future
that is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda
we need to set a growth target of at least 
the aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone
the europe of innovation and the information society also need to be commandeered to reach this target
we are a long way from it today
we must also recognise that we need another type of economic and financial policy
i think that the special summit in lisbon will herald responsible economic planning in the european union
congratulations
in adopting the luxembourg process the heads of state and government achieved tangible successes
since  however the really significant results have failed to materialise
so far the cologne employment pact has not been able to be invested with sufficient content
in addition the macroeconomic dialogue lacks the participation of the european parliament as an equal partner
this is the most effective way of reducing unemployment
in this context the ciampi group also mentions the european company statute
it puts the loss to the economy of not having a statute of this kind at eur  billion a year
we do not want the basic unrefined european company model
we need this european company to come supplied with minimum standards of worker participation
we should also judge the success of the lisbon summit on the contribution it makes to achieving this goal
mr presidentinoffice of the council do you know how archimedes expounded his theory of the lever
he would say give me a fulcrum and i will lift the world
in lisbon you will clearly be trying to lift the world or in any case our world the world of europe
as for the lever you have described all the appropriate mechanisms in your exhilarating proposal which is exciting in so many respects
that simply leaves the fulcrum
the fulcrum is provided by resources
nevertheless you will have to have the means at your disposal means which i fear you are somewhat lacking at present
it is thus up to you to create them
the straitjacket of agenda  will not provide you with the requisite means
you will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed
it is clear  and you explained this very well  that the social divide is a fundamental problem that we must eradicate
there is no need to add to this what i will call the digital divide
indeed to whom will you offer this information and knowledge society
this is not your objective
unfortunately there is one component missing from the mechanism that you have envisaged i refer to the public services
the public services have played a key role throughout the entire existence of our european social model
but we cannot stop there
the framework programme will not suffice it will have to be boosted and its broad guidelines modified
this is a major task but we are relying on you to see it through
they are a tool for political decision making
and yet they incorporate institutional measures whose influence we will be able to assess in the medium term
they will bolster the role of the european council in the decisionmaking process
what we are doing here has certain implications
let us assess its impact on the set of decisions that we will take when we have to discuss the reform of the general affairs council
it is up to each and every one of us to work on this
lastly a final word on social cohesion
but we do not feel that social exclusion can be eradicated in a piecemeal fashion
we know that this requires a proactive approach and that we can count on your determination
we will offer you our support in lisbon in laying down new guidelines for the european union s economic policy
mr president along with my colleagues i would like to welcome the very clear document that the portuguese presidency has given us today
however i would conclude by asking which is going to come first
can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent
if we wait for that to happen i fear the great objectives you have set before us will not be achieved
i would like to draw your attention to three points in particular which seem essential to me if this summit wants to succeed as a major social summit
here too we need standards of excellence and a luxembourg process
i wish the presidentinoffice all the best in the pursuit of his ambitions
mr president there is an idea in the portuguese presidency s statement which i like very much
if that is the case mr presidentinoffice then we urgently need common objectives
that would give you another ally for your policy
the central role of employment and social policy in the creation of this new society is based on two factors
on the one hand we have economic efficiency since in this new technological context the quality of human resources is essential
europe needs to achieve full employment
this full employment should be adapted to the society taking shape with greater possibilities for its men and women
we must improve the effectiveness of active employment policies
we must strengthen the synergies between adaptability education and lifelong training
all of this has to be done thinking of the european citizen
it has to be done thinking of the men and women who live and work daily in our countries
we need to solve the problems of poverty and we need a social model which is suited to these new conditions
if austria does this however it will be lying to and duping the very people who voted for one of the parties in its government
i hope that it does just that
the prime concern of the european citizens after health is probably employment
within this concern employment is linked to competitiveness
all of this is absolutely essential we need technological change and institutional reform
the intention to achieve actual coordination of the socioeconomic policy across the board appeals to me a great deal
i would like to draw your attention to three specific points
the first point concerns corporate governance
on the last page of the president s document i noticed the intention to set up an observatory for industrial change
in my opinion you do not get something for nothing their cooperation in these activities should also be outlined
so i would ask that this point be given due attention too
this is innovation and not just structural technological innovation but also innovation in the field of procedures and methods
as mr van lancker has already said the social affairs council must have the same status as the ecofin council
social dialogue must then be consolidated as a fundamental means of reaching a consensus on the implementation of the necessary changes
we therefore hope that this lisbon summit will help to change the present model of female employment
in order to achieve this strategic direction there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion
the fact that parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important
all these words and the ideas behind them can apply to both opportunities and threats
obviously in order to achieve this there are two issues which are crucial in all areas
this certainly holds true for globalisation which permits greater growth in wealth international trade and productivity
to give an example in europe we have a textile industry
the answer is simple i am speaking on behalf of  countries one of the things that the portuguese presidency has guaranteed is austria s full participation in the workings of all of the union s institutions
i am talking about principles and values which come from the enlightenment and which affirm the supremacy of reason
because if modern societies have one enemy today it is irrationality in political behaviour
we could call this irrationality political populism or excessive nationalism or religious fundamentalism or racism or xenophobia
 commission
firstly we are not starting from scratch
anybody who may think that we have been too optimistic in this debate must understand that we are not starting from scratch
europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on
now then we have to increase productivity in these areas sufficiently to sustain economic growth without inflation
however we must be careful
this is a problem which will become irresolvable in the future if it is not already
therefore our responsibility is both economic and social
in lisbon we will have to take some practical decisions
with regard to this i would just like to mention a specific point given that a great many references have been made to the united states
there was a great deal of public investment at federal state and local levels
these were huge investments and they were in modern infrastructures
the market private individuals and companies will build the vehicles but it is our responsibility to build the new highways
there is therefore a very clear strategy for lisbon
the problem is simple
it is clear that at this point the three processes have to be combined
you see all the different pieces are coming together to give direction to lisbon
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place on wednesday at  noon
the debate is closed
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
i should like to request that you contribute to the sitting s reaching a speedy conclusion by keeping to the speaking times
there are three reasons for this
the second is that the people sitting behind the glass screens  the interpreters  also want to go home
so please keep to the speaking times and we will make good progress
environmental dimension in the development process
rapporteur
the challenge for us all consists in integrating social and environmental considerations
in spite of the fact that this is a document of several hundred pages it is a programme which in general is well put together
if further progress is to be made towards the necessary level of integration an appropriate method has to be developed
this type of work has been going on for many years in many of the oecd countries
it could be given higher priority but it is in fact under way
matters are organised rather less well in the majority of developing countries
in this context aid can play an important role
so far there remains however a lot to be done in terms of developing methods
i was responsible for the preparations for this second reading
my work has of course been very much based upon experiences from the first reading and upon the preparatory work for that reading
on that occasion parliament tabled a large number of amendments of which approximately a third have been accepted by the council ahead of this second reading
this is something we ought to support a fact which also emerges from amendment no 
i think that the council s proposal is acceptable because an evaluation will take place within four or five years
this question will then at all events return to parliament
finally i want to mention a question on which there have been and remain a variety of views
i hope that the vote will ensure that this will also become parliament s proposal
might i just ask for one more thing
the fact is we shall need further consultations
i would therefore propose without further ado that the vote could take place on wednesday
it is now our task to counteract this
in the industrialised countries significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment
nigeria can once again serve as an example here as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage
here too education and training measures need to be supported in order in the end to help people to help themselves
even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the treaty or the regulation is revised
the greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact
from this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied
no programme can be truly effective unless it is conducted in close collaboration with the communities concerned
however at present this approach is being applied scandalously badly by the eu as far as scientific and technological projects are concerned
the eu s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries
in other words our north african partners for example cannot become involved in scientific and technological projects concerning the environment
but why not
it has been made easier for eastern europe to participate
we must ensure that no project can be established without input from local researchers
to do this sufficient financial support is of course necessary
that is why i like one previous speaker already advocate voting in favour of the rapporteur s amendment no 
hopefully we are reaching the conclusion of a process that started a year ago under the previous parliament
so for many of us this is an interesting learning experience
the previous regulation expired at the end of 
since the beginning of this year the commission has been unable to make any new financial commitments on these budget lines
this places the commission and europe in an increasingly difficult situation
hence our desire to conclude the process of adoption in the near future
the main areas of difference have been on the financial reference amounts on comitology and on the duration of the regulation
i would like to comment briefly on each of these issues
on the financial reference amount briefly we accept the compromise proposals put forward under amendment no 
comitology
hence the commission supports in principle amendment no  but prefers the wording of amendments nos   and 
concerning the duration of the regulation our position has been to support an unlimited duration subject to periodic revision following evaluations
however we are aware that if unlimited duration were to be approved here this would lead inevitably to a conciliation process
the final important issue common to both this regulation and the forest regulation are the amendments concerning bank guarantees
hence the problem has to a large extent been resolved
furthermore the commission considers that such matters are best addressed in a horizontal manner rather than through specific regulations
for these reasons the commission does not support the proposed amendment no  on bank guarantees
with regard to these two types of amendments the position of the commission is as follows
amendment no  proposes the raising of the threshold for submission of projects for consideration by the council from eur  million to eur  million
given that most projects are already under eur  million this amendment is considered not relevant
furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process
therefore the commission does not support it
the amendments on procurement and access to the markets  amendments nos  and   would mean a departure from standard and carefully agreed formulations
such a unit is in fact already operational although we intend to strengthen it further
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
if the rapporteur wishes the vote to be postponed i would ask him to request this at voting time
our services say that it is possible to do so then
conservation and sustainable forest management
mr bouwman interrupted the president
bouwman
de mr president i think you are mistaken
there is another report first
i would be happy to speak now but there is another report first
president
thank you very much mr bouwman i knew right at the beginning of the debate that there was a reason why i was so pleased to see you here in the house
please forgive me my files have got in rather a muddle
that does happen from time to time in the hectic activity of the night sitting
forget what i have said so far
we will start again
mr president i should like to say that i agree with many of the points made in the report by the previous speaker and rapporteur mr fernandez martin
above all as with all budget lines it is very important to discuss the funding these budget lines represent
mr president commissioner mr martin you have certainly described very clearly what your report is all about
thank you for that
but we also all know only too well that not all projects are as successful as we would like them to be
it is also very important for us now for the projects to be able to continue to run without interruption
thank you very much for this generous gift to my colleagues
the biodiversity of our planet is at stake
he has identified some valid points certain aspects of which i would like to examine more closely
it would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation
firstly programmes must be more closely targeted at the rehabilitation of tropical forests
besides this future community actions must take into consideration every facet of sustainable forest management
this implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems
we must without doubt take up the challenges laid down in this report but must also institute a genuine community policy on conservation and sustainable management
thank you commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
shipgenerated waste and cargo residues
now mr jarzembowski is the great moment
mr president commissioner we are debating a directive which is extremely  i repeat extremely  rigorous
we have been discussing the erika disaster here for the past couple of weeks
normal shipping operations account for double this amount
not only that
only  is due to tourism and a large proportion is even unaccountable for although that of course must originate from somewhere
in other words this affects our own habitat
i do not need to say any more concerning the motives underlying this directive
i will only have positive things to say to the commission about the quality of the directive
there was nonetheless a whole raft of amendments at first reading which has been completely endorsed by parliament
these will reemerge in some shape or form
i would mainly like to home in on one very important point
we all share the view throughout the union that something needs to be done when the seas are polluted
i would once again refer to the erika but there are also other examples
we are also agreed that the polluterpays principle must apply
there is no financial incentive
let me illustrate this quite clearly
northern countries apply a system in which this financial element is handled in a different way
everyone pays whether they dump their waste in the sea or dispose of it elsewhere
experience and scientific research has shown that this seems to work
this is in fact what we are opting for
if the percentage is  so be it
it could also be  but there should at least be a minimum level which should be quite inflexible
otherwise we will fall back into a variety of systems and it will be years  in a manner of speaking  before we learn from the lesson we have actually already been taught
i fear that this will be opted for in practice
this will also be the key point of discussion for the foreseeable future
there is a whole raft of other factors involved and we have reached agreement on a great many of them
i do believe that somehow we will make it
but this is the crux of the matter and i wanted to draw everyone s attention to it
may i thank the rapporteur mr bouwman very much for taking on this dossier and for elucidating it so well
we are after all at one with the council on three points
they must therefore be provided
secondly all ships regardless of the flag they fly have to dispose of their waste
thirdly the costs must be borne by the ship
we agree on these points
that means that we want to have an effective system
the really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship
mr bouwman has of course already explained this
there are two precedents
surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port
the other system is the pure polluterpays principle anyone who lands shipgenerated waste has to pay extra for doing so
this second system has proved to be ineffective otherwise why would the mediterranean sea be so dirty
why would the north sea be so dirty
because for lack of adequate controls the polluterpays principle does not work
that is the decisive issue
we are prepared to reach an agreement with the council
but so far the council has rejected any serious agreement with us
that is also why i would make the following request of the commission madam vicepresident think carefully about which side you stand on
for these reasons support our nospecialfee system
perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the council in the conciliation procedure
there are a few points at stake tomorrow
this is what this is about and a majority of us have said as much in debates here
in january we had a very thorough debate with you commissioner on the consequences of the erika disaster
on this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas
this scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the council either
the council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them
the conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made
and therein lies the difference with the council which is saying that a contribution has to be made
but a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case god knows this would be too little
nothing would change
there would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules
i think that this is also about the credibility of the union and in particular parliament
we will not be able to rule out accidents altogether but we can take optimal precautions
this consistent directive is an important step towards doing this
mr president commissioner rapporteur congratulations on your report
you have said so yourself just now we desperately need this directive
it is a sound directive
ports must be equipped with reception facilities
inspection is on its way at long last
member states must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken
this is very important
this is good for the environment
as such this directive is already coming into effect in a sense
there is one point as already highlighted by mr jarzembowski where we do not see eye to eye
how do we charge the fees
we are all agreed on the polluter pays principle
but should he pay an automatic full amount or a huge amount in port dues or do we opt for a flexible arrangement as is being proposed by the council
where is the best financial incentive to use your words
i have sounded out a number of people on this subject
the opinions are divided
habits apparently are also divided
in fact ports in one and the same region apply different standards and percentages
there are also ports which change percentages at the last minute if i may say so
i believe that as such it is probably better if we in parliament do not pin ourselves down on a fixed percentage
a flexible system under these conditions as you said so yourself should make up a substantial part of the costs
 is clearly not a substantial part
fellow meps we must rescue this directive and keep it come what may
these days we know that waste has a habit of reappearing often in a more harmful form
largescale pollution of the sea and the destruction of the animal life caused by shipwrecked tankers always attracts a great deal of attention
far less attention is given to the fact that seas are polluted on a daily basis by regular merchant navy ships and recreational yachts
we can benefit from practical experience gained in ports such as my home town rotterdam
the question is of course raised as to whether rules can have an adverse effect on smaller vessels
i am under the impression that the rapporteur has sought the best possible solution and has listened carefully to the comments
other solutions would probably have a less favourable effect on environmental protection and my group can assent to this report on that basis
no absolute consensus was found but that s politics for you
it is now evident particularly from this debate that there is a bone of contention here
i would like to say that we have made some progress here
mr president every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships
this rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches severely damaging the environment and marine life
as a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year
however we share the rapporteur s concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution
this is an extraordinarily important report
it should be emphasised in this context that it is not mainly legislation that is missing
the aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea
it is a question rather of increasing access to port reception facilities and of creating the motivation also to use these
the baltic is affected every year by a great many oil spills of greatly varying sizes
in swedish waters alone there are hundreds of these each year
the baltic is also more vulnerable from an environmental point of view than many other seas
this is as i see it a sphere in which we have everything to gain by cooperating across national borders
we can never in a million years solve europe s environmental problems alone
there will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind
we shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills
first every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste
secondly polluters must pay naturally
i agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships
any decision that for example enables the member states to grant subsidies to the different ports would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective
i believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward
as you know the commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution
and this is where the problem lies
as various speakers have already pointed out this is where the positions of parliament and the commission differ fundamentally
it is true that we are not specifying what percentage will have to be paid by the ships arriving at the port
perhaps we could incorporate the word significant into the text instead of setting a fixed percentage
but i would try first of all to take this step forward making the position more flexible with the possibility of revising it
i could go on but the two reasons have already been stated
we are all working towards the same goal
the only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal
i would ask for support for a more positive position supplemented  i insist  with amendment no  by mr sterckx which would provide us with the necessary guarantees
many thanks mr president
i would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the committee
thank you madam vicepresident
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles
a good commissioner should listen
can that be deducted from the time
commissioner i actually wanted to address a minor comment to you which applies both to this report and to the preceding one
there comes a time when you have to come to a decision because postamsterdam the conciliation procedure is the great good
i do not believe that this is necessary here
i wanted actually to relate this comment to the report before us
the president has read out a very laborious title
i think that we simply cannot do enough for road traffic safety
there is a consensus on that
this directive on lorry inspections should quite simply make a contribution to this
we are seeing a slight fall in the number of those killed and injured on the roads
the causes are often precisely technical defects
we must not sit back and accept this
after all a lorry does around   kilometres a year
this is an inconceivably high number compared with a private car
now europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks
this directive tries to cater for this problem by introducing a graduated inspection procedure until the vehicle is taken out of service
there has been a high measure of agreement between parliament the council and the commission apart from on one problem and that is penalties
in its common position the council makes no mention of any arrangements
then the council said  and these might not be its exact words  that the penalties would be directed at the member states
no penalties should be directed at hauliers lorryowners and drivers
that would not make any sense
neither is it very european
that is why on the procedure i should like to say once more that amendment no  replaces amendment no  which was adopted by the committee
it ought therefore to be put to the vote first tomorrow
if the bureau which will be chairing the vote tomorrow could be informed of this i would be very grateful
then we would not have any procedural problems with this
so put amendment no  to the vote first
it would then replace amendment no 
mr president everything has been said
allow me simply to offer the vicepresident a helping hand so that she might support amendment no   which replaces no   after all
that is why i think that this amendment no  which mr piecyk has drafted as rapporteur is excellent
he has completely avoided the word harmonisation 
but he has said what this is all about
given the danger to the passengers and also other drivers this would however be necessary
that is why this is not about the question of whether we are in favour of subsidiarity or centralism
the first principle madam vicepresident is for us all to attach the same degree of importance to the need to improve road safety
the second argument is that there must be no distortions of competition in the community
this lies at the heart of the difference between parliament s views and the common position
i know they are familiar figures but   citizens are killed each and every year
that is the equivalent to a mediumsized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year
firstly the safety argument that we have already heard about
thirdly there are also the environmental benefits  the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles
i welcome this initiative and i hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible
mr president commissioner reforming the directive on annual inspections of commercial vehicles is both urgent and vital
the rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue in the final analysis
the directive will be more efficacious if the member states can negotiate a harmonised system of penalties
this should not however slow down the prompt implementation of the directive
justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in finland
the drivers of thirtythree of them received fines and sixteen received a warning
three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey
only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition
a considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from nonmember countries
everyone can imagine what sort of safety hazard such a lorry would be on roads covered in snow and ice
our group supports amendment no  and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly
it is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on
mr president madam vicepresident ladies and gentlemen safety on our roads is of great concern to us all
time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects
these spot tests may be carried out at the roadside at ports and harbours or where trucks are parked
this is then a matter of improving road safety in the eu which is vital
road safety is a serious matter
we can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life
it is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long
this may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads
we also accept amendment no  and i would like to refer to what mr bouwman said
once again i would like to reiterate my appreciation of the quality of work carried out not only by the rapporteur but by the committee as a whole
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
closing of the session
i declare the  session closed
the sitting was closed at  pm
opening of the session
i declare resumed the  session of the european parliament
agenda
quite by accident i learnt yesterday at  pm that the vote was to take place at noon today
it was however initially scheduled i thought for noon tomorrow
you know as well as i do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media
i should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow
it would suit me personally and i do not think anyone would have any objection since it is a relatively brief vote
mr president we do not have anything against postponing the vote
however i insist on the other scheduled votes particularly those on the lisbon summit going ahead tomorrow
we have nothing against postponement with this proviso
the competent services have informed me that tomorrow s list of subjects will be rather lengthy
after all it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for  pm
i would therefore ask also on behalf of many others to postpone the vote until tomorrow
mr blokland the officials of the competent services have informed me that your report will automatically be put to the vote tomorrow
i now ask the house whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the lannoye report until tomorrow
if we are all in agreement that is what the arrangement will be
annual legislative programme continuation
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the european commission s annual legislative programme for the year 
but this also means that the commission faces an immense challenge
this could also be described in terms of carrying out or implementing the subsidiarity principle
we want to reinforce europe s role on the international stage in a clear and unequivocal manner just as we want to increase its competitiveness
that said we do not want to bureaucratise europe and neither do we want to centralise it
that is not how we envisage europe to be
if you make these your goals mr president of the commission then we will be behind you every step of the way
moving onto another point the commission has passed a long list of its intentions to parliament
exchanging lists in this way is not an ideal way to engage in dialogue
therefore in future we should think of something different
mr president of the commission i would just like to pick up again on your expression decisive year 
we must all make it our business to follow the debates on europe in the various individual member states and not just in those we happen to come from
it is not about preventing globalisation we would not succeed there in any case
the only way forward is to form this global outlook on the basis of our own values and diversity
to this end therefore we must work together to bring about a significant improvement in communication which is something you yourself mentioned
you are in the process of drafting a communication strategy for the enlargement of the european union
mr president my group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme
however we have some concerns about the process
i came to this procedure as a relatively new member of this house
indeed to carry the metaphor further and using the english usage if we were going to make a meal from these it would be rather long and rather indigestible
i understand that it has been the normal tradition to obediently produce these lists
all this sits rather uneasily with endless lists
with this in mind we produced a onepage resolution highlighting key areas
this would get away from the shoppinglist approach and give more political focus
it would allow parliament to participate fully in the process not just by swapping shopping lists with you
what we would like to do is catch the imagination of europe s citizens
the programme submitted to us for this year is generous to say the least
it contains some positive elements and some less positive elements
i should like to draw attention to one area that i feel is rather deficient the area of social policy
indeed in terms of social policy the commission and parliament have the opportunity to promote many things
this shows a general decline in working conditions in a number of important sectors
for example in the environmental field we have a white paper on civil liability in environmental matters
and after the white paper we shall probably have to wait a long time before we have the directive
this shows just how slow the procedure is and in order to give reasons for this slowness i feel it would be important to have an interim report
let me give one example of this
today a proposal for a directive on electrical and electronic waste has been announced
this proposal has already been put forward several times but has never been tabled
president prodi a friendly word of advice
we live in the best of all possible worlds  threatening clouds of stars and stripes are filling the skies of europe
mr president i welcome the broad thrust of the proposals published by the commission in its annual legislative programme for the year 
at present the five larger member states have two posts within the european commission and there is one each for the smaller member states
undoubtedly the european council representing the fifteen governments will have to reform its structures
i believe this is an important right which should be left in the domain of national member states
in my own country the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways
this cannot be said of many of the other member states
in conclusion can i say that i am very pleased that the president has this morning referred to fisheries
an information technology revolution is certainly upon us
we cannot be passengers when these changes take place
it is perhaps difficult to know who is going to provide the salutary shock and when
that is often the case with historical new departures
it is orwellian to a t under the heading of decentralisation  centralisation is taking place
under the heading of democracy  democracy is being dismantled
under the heading of greater transparency  the commission is proposing an arrangement through which documents that are at present available for public inspection will be locked away
we were to be able to have access to any document once the commission had given it to others
the elected representatives of the people would no longer be the last to be informed
we should no longer have to sit in the committee rooms looking at the students from the permanent representations in possession of documents to which we ourselves have no access
we should no longer have to tolerate a situation in which the employers in the european union or the farming industry s copa can consult documents which we ourselves cannot obtain
it is fundamental to a democracy that the executive should serve the electorate and the electorate s representatives
in the eu the legislature has been transferred to the executive
the elected representatives of the people are awarded monopolies on power while fundamental documents from the decisionmaking process are kept secret
i hope that mr prodi will say i am sorry i was not aware that my officials were doing the opposite of what i had promised
i stand by my words here is my signature to the transparency that was promised 
thank you if there is in fact anything to say thankyou for
i would particularly like to thank mr poettering for what he had to say in this connection
the commission must not stand idly by in a situation of this kind
it has a duty to see to it that the solidarity enshrined in the treaties is upheld
in acknowledgement of my responsibility as a parliamentarian i myself sent a letter to this effect to all the heads of government yesterday
mr president i would first of all like to thank the president of the commission mr prodi for his work programme
it seems as if we are talking about two different documents
we want to project a much stronger united front as far as this european foreign policy is concerned
but the instruments involved are also an important factor
they help in the analysis of nonmilitary crises and help us to act on them quickly
if we look at mozambique for example how long have we had to wait before real action could be taken
this is about very concrete issues such as transport capacity
to this end we need swifter coordination within the european union
take the enormous cattle losses mongolia has suffered
we know that there are funds available in tacis and echo within the european union
but why are we not helping out
this is because there are too many bureaucratic hurdles
the eu s overseas dealings will need to be better tuned to our need for a stronger future european foreign policy
in short operational implementation is central
relations with russia are of vital importance
it is extremely depressing to note that freedom of press is still not guaranteed in russia
we had invited the journalist mr babitsky to visit us next thursday but this was vetoed by the russian authorities
i hope that the european commission too will protest in the strongest terms to the russian authorities
mr president mr prodi when a parliament discusses legislative priorities then everything becomes a priority
i should now like to make a few comments on economic and social matters
one of the commission s initiatives which deserves a high priority is the eeurope initiative
yesterday we discussed the lisbon summit for the economic and social revival of europe
shared objectives for growth in order to enable us to move towards full employment are something i have hoped and prayed for
full employment does not mean the total absence of any form of unemployment
there will always be some cyclical unemployment with workers looking to change jobs young people entering the labour market
in this context the eeurope initiative comes at just the right moment
what we should be doing is educating our own intelligent young people and keeping them in europe
a commission document has just shown that half of the young people who pursue postgraduate studies in the united states go on to stay there
in order to keep our brainpower to attract the best brains and to train them further we must make massive investments in research and development
surely this provides the rest of europe with an example to be followed
improved living conditions employment and the quality of employment will continue to be intimately linked to our ability to make european research more dynamic
along the same lines a proper european patent the development of venture capital and support for young businesses are also of crucial importance
last night president prodi reiterated my expression regarding europe s lack of future prospects
we all know that we are living through a paradigm shift with the advent of the information society and the development society
such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained
a page general summary does not exactly do justice to the  initiatives cited in the annex
the commission president s speech this morning raises three concerns in my mind
subsidiarity must be seen to apply it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so
the second concern relates to budgets
lastly a word of caution about the question of information
it looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement
a lot of other people have also said that here today
but what is the situation now
i hope that mr prodi is listening
mr president the report you have presented is ambitious and complex and i will only touch on a few points
two the internal market
working in the european parliament we can see that harmonisation of the existing legislation on civil law is essential
in all probability we ought to start work in the field of administrative law as well
moreover every day we become more aware of the need for a common legal system coordinating the different legal systems of the member states
three the preparatory documents
mr president with regard to fishing i am not going to go into the details of the commission s legislative proposals
delays in transposition are an endemic problem in the commission
from the point of view of this institution there are serious doubts as to whether this is the best way to resolve this problem
the question is in which direction this commission is heading
to this end i hope that the commission will bear in mind the points of view being expressed in the european parliament
in this respect i would like to refer to the codification of community law
finally mr president i would like to remind you of a text which is mentioned in the commission communication
it is point  on the statute of the outermost regions which is to be implemented by the commission
mr president the president of the commission will not be surprised if i speak to him about the internal market
what has the reform of the commission to do with the internal market
the answer is a lot
this guiding principle is mainly the protection of the community s financial interests
that is clearly of concern to all of us but it is only a starting point
from there on the commission must begin to work and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the treaty
allow me to give you an example since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea
let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure
what is the intention there
it is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created but rather demands will be selected
how can this be
how can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way
from the point of view of this parliament this type of arrangement cannot be allowed we understand that the commission has to be reformed
we agree with the objectives of this reform
thank you mr prodi for your presentation and your documentation
congratulations on using the internet for the general public  a very good idea
i will start with trade
we agree with you that we need a rulesbased trading system
it is essential
please can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen
innovation and knowledge  very appropriate for a new century
how much innovation has taken place in the commission or indeed in the parliament may i say
we had a white paper on innovation some years ago  what has happened since
we have under way the fifth research framework programme  what has happened to what was learned in the fourth
what is the dissemination for the new ideas the new products the new comparisons of socioeconomic systems
followup again please
we welcome incidentally the formation of a european research area which you and commissioner busquin have put forward
this is an excellent way in which to begin the century
i will now use a tremendous cliche truism  our greatest resource in the european union is our people 
it is a disgrace and i hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation
i hope there will be a followup to the science white paper
mr president the internal reform of the commission has begun
we welcome that
for the moment we have a series of measures and a white paper
go for it
however i would like to point out one fault in the document
the officials responsible including the commissioners did not make use of these measures of these recourses which existed before
now that we are establishing new measures how do we know they will be used
only you know the answer to this secret
the lack of motivation amongst excellent civil servants is serious
we must take action and the example should come from above
the reform of the commission mr prodi should not only protect the financial interests of the community
far more resources are lost through an ineffective and unmotivated administration
furthermore we also have to accept that officials who take responsibility and risks may make mistakes
you said in your speech that you prefer to make mistakes rather than fail to act
go for it mr prodi
your task must be an historic task
you are not the first to try it we hope that you succeed
in fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now
we welcome the luxembourg procedure
we hope it will be deepened strengthened and extended to other areas such as convergence in social protection
but does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area
i think not
there are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past
that means that we need to pursue with vigour the general framework on information and consultation at work
but is it just about updating
no
there are other areas
i had a woman come to see me recently called mrs angela elliot mathis working for lucent technologies
she had worked in a range of european countries for high technology companies
thirteen months into the job she was dismissed without notice and without reason
she still has no reason for the dismissal
these are the gaps we need to plug
let us do it in the new mediumterm social action programme
however i have to say to you that my group deplores the fact that several dossiers at this moment are blocked in council
why not
quite simply because the wto according to the marrakech model does not permit this or permits it only with extreme difficulty
i would make the same call for coherence in another area the management of the pigmeat crisis
this is a situation which runs totally counter to our european farm model which is based on a multiplicity of diversified and multifunctional family farms
my final point concerns the preparation of the budget for 
admittedly the budget lines for agriculture may be examined in order to reflect the need to show solidarity with the balkans this is true
can i take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the fiveyear strategic plan
therefore opening up the invisible cities of decisionmaking in europe to the citizenry is absolutely vital
can i welcome the annual programme in particular because there was one omission from the fiveyear plan
that was the whole area of education youth and culture which did not make an appearance at all
again we need a programme of education that matches the best practice across the whole of europe
this means perhaps looking again at all our educational programmes to see that they match the programmes we are particularly enthusiastic about
can i just in finishing say that we will have started four new programmes by the end of this year  media culture  youth and socrates
i do not accept that this will simply be a oneoff event
in such circumstances it would be mad to slash the budget to this extent
we should be spending more to alleviate this crisis rather than contemplating spending less
i urge honourable members when we come to vote on this issue to vote against this proposal
mr president i should like to return to the subject of the annual legislative programme after that digression on the european budget
that is a very good example but what happened to the other five
it seems that the commission has not responded
one out of six is simply not good enough
we now have an intergovernmental conference looking at the treaties again
mr president the commission has submitted a promising work programme for the year 
we cannot do other than give this programme our full backing
however there are also some unfortunate gaps in it
there is one gap in particular i would like to discuss it is one mr jarzembowski touched on just before
i do not see the work programme make any mention whatsoever of tourism
we have long been promised measures for this sector
it requires improvement as a matter of urgency but nothing is happening
but the commission has other important tasks to perform besides those of a legislative nature
as a citizen of the country in question i do not object to this modus operandi
if the commission is to be the guardian of the treaties then please mr prodi be thorough in your work
i have and so on and so forth written down here but i hope that things do not continue in this vein
mr president ladies and gentlemen thank you for this clear practical substantial debate
the only thing i would ask is that you view my speech as just part of an overall debate which is taking shape day by day
this debate has clearly revealed the vital importance of our cooperation
there has to be a break
today concern was expressed over the length of the list of subjects to be put to the vote
well in my opinion today was the right time to deal with the list and the right time for indepth analysis
of course certain areas are missing from this list
in any case the list contains many subjects the details of which will have to be discussed in committees
there is therefore a series of issues on which we must work together this year
we must make the most of this opportunity since as you have pointed out we have a major problem with our budget
today s speeches reveal a precise but ruthless analysis
in addition it is vital for parliament and the commission to work well together to make these decisions
i am fully aware of this
we talked about the levels of governability which need to be adopted in europe not decentralisation
it is for this reason that i have continued to push for a white paper on governability
we are in the process of creating something completely new
and in order to do this we must work together
each year we present a report on the actions we have undertaken
in february we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in  which we would like to expand
these are the plans for a great european union plans with a specific objective
a criticism was made of globalisation which to me is absurd for globalisation is already underway the problem is rather how to accomplish it
do we want to play a leading role in this globalisation
do we want behave responsibly in respect of developing countries and the third world in this matter
i feel that this is an extremely important strategy
there is an obvious need for a collective conscience which will take care of the whole world and not just our own particular interests
we cannot stifle these countries at such a decisive moment as this
and enlargement is a part of all this it is not just a means of preserving peace it is a means of defining our role
unfortunately i did not receive any answer to this question
it is a question which is being debated everywhere in europe at the moment and we should be extremely interested to hear his view
no not this time either
thank you very much mrs thors
the president of the commission has given his answer and we must now continue the debate
i have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
cocoa and chocolate products
the common position is a balanced compromise and we should seek not to change it too much
the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection has however adopted two important amendments
i welcome these even though in my opinion they do not go far enough
i am thinking in particular of the cocoa producers of west africa numbering more than ten million whose future has clearly been compromised
why should i say that when there is a proposed annex in the common position which appears to answer the problem
unfortunately this restriction does not provide any guarantees for the future
mr president ladies and gentlemen i feel that this is an approach which is in line with what we voted on two years ago
mr president chocolate was the topic of a stormy debate at first reading
this was justified and not without results
justified because the original proposal focused exclusively on the internal market
the discussion was not without results either
upon serious analysis of the common position it has to be said that democracy works
we did not sit passively on the fence muttering under our breath but took a proactive approach in tabling amendments
should we assent to other legislation
fine if that is what is to be done but could we do so on our terms please
we only wanted tropical fats the common position provides an exhaustive list of them
we wanted an impact study
we are getting one two and a half years after the directive has entered into force
we wanted the commission to draft an amendment proposal if need be
well now the commission will need to do so and we can then amend it again if necessary
we did not want comitology for essential amendments
we are getting codecision
many of us in this house were displeased with the commission proposal
even if none of the amendments survive the result is still worth seeing
i would like to finish off with the following thought
in the debate on chocolate the word ethics was used more than once
if a victory is achieved one should be able to enjoy it too
perhaps we ought to learn to do this one day
mr president it has taken us twentyfive years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise
i want to pay tribute to mr lannoye
he is a parliamentarian of considerable skill and he has argued his case throughout with force and conviction
the amendments that came before the environment committee with the exception of the few that were passed were wrecking amendments
my group supports the common position with some exceptions and they will all make themselves heard in this debate
we believe that this is good for consumers
they get a wider choice of product and separate and distinctive labelling
it is good for the manufacturers of all the vegetable fats and i include cocoa butter in this
quality argues for itself
you can have additional labelling if you want
after all chocolate is also considered a stimulant unfortunately
this agony will come to an end today
they are all interesting in their own way but most interesting of all is the consumer in my opinion
the most important principle is that of the consumer s freedom of choice
we politicians need to show some prudence in this respect
after all there is no accounting for taste
the european parliament cannot and should not prescribe a harmonised euro taste
after all chocolate is not exactly a product like cigarettes
there are of course other interests which need to be taken into consideration
for example we need to be aware of the precarious situation of the countries where the ingredients for chocolate originate
prudence is called for once again
after all there are conflicting interests involved
the countries that ivory coast exports cocoa to also import other competing ingredients from countries such as mali and burkina faso
the council s common position as it is now before us attempts to accommodate all these interests
we feel that it is lacking in one or two areas
the best that can be said of this compromise is that none of the parties involved have been indulged completely
there are no winners but there are no losers either
most members of the liberal group can tolerate this precarious balance
we therefore support the common position and believe that the directive should be adopted as soon as possible
in the first place we must ask ourselves what is the relevance of this directive which is going to change the definition of chocolate
what is there to stop us in future describing oil to which palm oil has been added as olive oil
in order to avoid chaos in producing countries the european parliament must demand an impact study on the export situation
mr president commissioner as all chocolatelovers know proper chocolate is made from cocoa butter
the addition of any other fats spoils the flavour
with the inclusion of new countries in the european union some derogations to this strict ban came to be granted
harmonisation was essential in the name of the free movement of goods
once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all
at second reading however the european parliament can thwart this directive which would have serious implications if it were applied
both consumers and small specialist chocolatemakers would suffer a reduction in quality and standards would be reduced to the lowest level
acp cocoaproducing countries would experience a considerable reduction in their market and their income
this would involve more than usd  million for the ivory coast alone
to say that they are extremely worried is an understatement
we have therefore tabled a motion to reject the council s common position
the small specialist chocolatemakers came to warn members of parliament at january s partsession in strasbourg
so i ask all the members who declared their solidarity with them to support our motion
mr president consumer protection is our prime concern
the issue of the directive on the production and sale of chocolate is thus just as important
the european union must lead the way in simplification confidence authenticity and respect for differences
since  european legislation has stipulated that the designation chocolate must be given to products containing only cocoa and cocoa butter
some member states have enjoyed a derogation from this law since acceding to the union
that is fine let everyone have their own chocolate bar in their own home
i therefore urge you to support amendments nos  and 
tastes are certainly culturally conditioned
if you yield to the compromise then a foodstuff will be admitted into our territory which is described as chocolate but which is not chocolate as far as we are concerned
we are defending the concept of authentic chocolate
cocoa butter is the very essence of chocolate
let us respect the guarantee of flavour that it offers
it is not enough to publish a white paper on food safety in order to reassure consumers
we are condemning an entire sector of specialists and smes if we accept any other definition of chocolate
today s vote is a symbolic one
surely scheduling an economic impact study years after the application of a directive belongs to the realm of the absurd
we want none of your compromise chocolate we are too familiar already with the federalist recipe
you should know ladies and gentlemen that making europe tasteless will not contribute to its popularity
mr president for centuries cows have eaten grass and chocolate has been made from cocoa
we are told above all to eat and drink without fear you are protected by the label 
then lacking arguments to justify the chocolate fraud the multinationals say you must accept  or there will be wholesale fraud
what then
all you have to do is call the product shealate if it is made from shea nuts or soyalate if it is made from soya but not chocolate 
it is a legal obligation with regard to the ivory coast and african farmers
finally it is a question of honesty of morality
mr president commissioner genetically modified organisms and mad cow disease were not enough to temper the enthusiasm of those involved in food manipulation
humans are continuing to play the sorcerer s apprentice juggling with food safety
here courtesy of industrial lobbying we have chocolate with added vegetable fats
its cocoa content is going to be reduced by  but it is still going to be entitled to the designation chocolate 
this is the crux of the problem
there is a clear lack of transparency and yet we distinguish butter from margarine
there will perhaps be a discreet entry in small letters on the back of the package indicating its new composition
there will be deterioration in the quality of course but also in the flavour and the goods are clearly not what they are represented as being
there is therefore no traceability and the door is open to all sorts of abuses
as far as we are concerned the use of the designation chocolate should be prohibited for any product which contains ingredients other than sugar and cocoa
we must not mislead the consumer by giving the name chocolate to just anything
europe must not adopt the lowest possible standards
it must ensure the quality of food products and consumer health
in the light of these principles we are unable to endorse the aims of this directive
rejecting it would represent a strong message to our citizens and a responsible attitude adopted by parliament
this is the thrust of our amendment if not when will we see wine made without grapes and butter without cream
but is this actually true
i will start with the information for the consumer
the commission has freely admitted that there is no foolproof detection method
the margin of error is 
at  this is even  more
this seems to be unacceptable to me
furthermore inspection depends on the type of chocolate and the information which the producer wishes to provide
which is it and which will it be
finally ladies and gentlemen i really need to get something else off my chest
well if that is the case and if that is an argument i suggest we pack our bags and go home now
each common position always strikes a delicate balance between national interests environmental conditions and social considerations
it is wonderful but millions of people in europe also enjoy the british product
none of them come to any harm in the process
whatever its content they are happy to call this product chocolate
it is insulting for us to play semantic games about the definition of this word
the citizens we represent are not fools
they can tell the difference between different varieties of chocolate and they have to be allowed to decide for themselves
i have no doubt that this compromise will help the overall market increase
mr president on the present issue i represent a minority of the members of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left
i consider that there is really no need for this directive and that it is unnecessary
i think it is absolutely excellent that we should have different rules about chocolate in different member states
in this area there is no need for harmonisation at eu level
instead the previous system can be retained
i think that is completely unnecessary
for one thing other tropical fats such as shea butter would be treated unfairly and certain countries would in that way suffer
for another the total market for chocolate products would probably decrease and thereby also perhaps the level of consumption of cocoa butter
my conclusion is that i should ideally like to see the old arrangement maintained with different rules in different countries
however since that is no longer possible i think that the common position is acceptable
i am very much in favour of clear labelling
mr president commissioner it is a known fact that chocolate made from pure cocoa butter induces a state of euphoria
the same cannot be said for this directive which we had absolutely no need of
indeed there would be a great deal to say about the attitude of some delegations within the council
today s consumer has had enough of being deceived
what is the council putting forward to solve the problem
a tiny piece of difficulttoread information hidden on the back of the product wrapper
this is not what we are asking for
the consumer will not be able to make an informed choice
we want the information to be obviously and clearly displayed on the front side of the product wrapper
this is what we achieved in the european parliament at first reading
we know that the cost of the fats capable of replacing cocoa is much less
that is why big industry is so much in favour of them
making things cheaper and cheaper what image of europe does that present
no matter nowadays what the consumer wants what the consumer s preferences are no matter the fact that public opinion wants ever greater transparency
who today can claim to be able to monitor this infamous  of vegetable fats which would replace the pure cocoa butter
nobody
so what is to be done
let us fortunately trust our smes the small specialist chocolatemakers who are going to have to work on a quality label
this is what the consumer wants
and let us most especially support our rapporteur mr lannoye
thank you very much mrs grossetete
welcome
cocoa and chocolate products continuation
we are talking about harmonisation the harmonisation of tastes of habits and almost of cultures
in short chocolate is a dividing factor and the divisions are neither ideological nor even national whatever some parties might think
what makes defending cocoaproducing countries an ideological matter i ask you
it is an ethical matter
in terms of the social aspect we are talking about millions of families who make their living from cocoa production
we have made formal commitments to them
so what is the reason for this time limit
the potential impact must be investigated in advance that is clear
any other sort of harmonisation would mean lowering standards and that is not the sort of europe that the consumer wants
rules are also important to protect consumers against genetic modification and against the addition of unexpected substances
lastly rules are important to protect expertise and craftsmanship within europe
what is now threatening to happen is at complete odds with this
should free trade be granted absolute priority
mr lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments
i suggest to the house that this is not a time to go back  this is a time to move on to move forward
after all this is not a product which is a threat to people s health
neither scandinavian belgian nor british chocolate is dangerous
it is not a product which affects the environment to any great degree
the whole issue is therefore somewhat ridiculous
where is the benefit in that for the third world
mr president we are in no position here in the european parliament to state that one type of chocolate is better or worse than another
nor can we say that one kind tastes better and another worse
rather we shall leave it to the individual consumer to judge which kind tastes best and is of the highest quality
let us not therefore make the same mistake as dom mintoff
it would be more like the kind of warning you find on cigarette packets
the chocolate war has been raging within the eu for  years
it has made ourselves as politicians and the eu as an institution look faintly ridiculous
we ought therefore to adhere precisely to the common position
mr president i am belgian and i am not opposed to the common position
so i know what i bought
i do concur with the rapporteur on one point
the producers of cocoa beans namely the small farmers in the poor thirdworld countries are vulnerable
it constitutes a delicate compromise which was difficult to achieve but which is wellbalanced
only those substances listed in the annex may be used
they are all of tropical origin and produced in acp countries
consumers will then be able to choose and to distinguish these products from those which are manufactured exclusively from cocoa
parliament s recommendation on second reading contains two amendments
the first amendment reiterates the commission s policy and this can be approved
the second amendment may nonetheless be approved in principle
to summarise it is only amendments nos  and  which may be approved and this for the aforesaid reasons
one of the members who spoke in this debate was mario soares who also supported the resolution adopted by a majority of this house
mr president we all have the right to express our opinions in this house and in a democracy
we may agree with something or we may not
if it has already responded what was the tenor of its response
ladies and gentlemen i understand the political institutional and compassionate motives behind these speeches
i would like to thank mr queiro mr seguro and mr pacheco pereira for their speeches
we shall now proceed to the vote
vote
mr president i regret causing some slight complications as regards the order of business of the plenary
there are basically two reasons
one is that the deadline for a request for separate votes on the amendments should have been made by  pm yesterday
because of a misunderstanding that request was not made in time
to pursue the voting as a block vote today would to my mind be unfortunate
the other reason has to do with comitology
we would benefit from additional discussions among party groups on certain details in relation to some of the amendments
hence i would ask you as rapporteur to follow my recommendation for postponement
the vote was postponed until the following day
just to repeat what my colleague poul nielson stated yesterday the commission s position on the amendments is as follows
the commission supports amendment no  in principle and supports the following amendments amendments nos       and 
the commission does not support the following amendments amendments nos       and 
parliament approved the common position as amended
amendment no 
mr president i just wanted to point out what repercussions a split vote would have
parliament approved the common position as amended
parliament approved the common position as amended
explanations of vote recommendation for second reading of the fernandez martin report a
these concerns are however drowned out in a hotchpotch of irresolute declarations
 fr the text of the report before us today fulfils the need to conserve tropical forests
these historic links and expert knowledge must be made to serve the conservation of this ecosystem
finally the european union actually includes large areas of tropical forest within the territory of its member states particularly france
the department of french guyana in particular is almost entirely covered by this type of vegetation
we have therefore backed the amendments of the ppede which support the flexibility necessary for the whole system
recommendation for second reading of the bouwman report a
in the jungle of maritime transport such behaviour is unfortunately frequently encountered
it helps to make refuse sites of our seas and beaches and to jeopardise the ecological balance of the marine environment
we can only applaud the proposed european directive which would make it possible to apply these principles
at the same time however we wish to ask the important question which is what is to become of the inspections
but what about vessels from outside the community
will they also be asked for certificates
and how will vessels that pass through our waters without docking into port be inspected
we know only too well the pressure of competition in maritime transport
there is no point in adopting conventions or directives if they are subsequently to remain dead letters for lack of inspection resources
today we face maritime pollution problems which we must tackle headon by adopting bold measures
the fact is as the rapporteur points out that regulations already exist but they are not observed
the system generally applied is the one governed by the polluter pays principle a principle which is outstanding in terms of its inefficiency
this is why we need to find an alternative
such an alternative is offered to us in an amendment which i supported
these charges would be used to finance the relevant installations up to 
everyone knows that some vessels even took advantage of the pollution caused by the wreck of the erika to discharge their waste at sea
this is absolutely scandalous and intolerable
there are however examples of good practice because the countries around the baltic sea have already been operating in this way since 
this system seems a fair one to me and i therefore voted in favour of it
 fr this proposed directive is most welcome within the european union
the real problem however is the application and observance of these standards
the fine polluter pays principle so dear to many member states including my own is far from being complied with
we feel that this is the only realistic and fair way to prevent the illegal dumping of waste at sea
moreover we wish to set the level for mandatory inspection at  of all vessels
on the eve of the french presidency of the european union this is the position which the french socialists are preparing to champion
all i can do is urge this house to do as much
in the last week of february  instances of illegal degassing were identified in the vicinity of the wreck of the erika alone
such practices are intolerable but they are difficult to monitor particularly at night or in foggy weather
to some extent it marks the official acknowledgement and establishment of a european maritime area subject to shared regulations
recommendation for second reading of the piecyk report a
 fr the european parliament has today expressed its opinion of the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
eu charter of fundamental rights
this resolution mandates the european parliamentary delegation inside the convention
we should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity
the effect of the charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary
i strongly commend the resolution
what is there to fear in a charter of fundamental rights
there will have to be acknowledgement of the political rights of citizens and the human rights of every individual person
fundamental rights will have to be defined in the face of fresh hazards
a catalogue of fundamental rights which are recognised as binding by the european institutions also sets out the duty of the citizens to respect them
this is how we must see the charter of fundamental rights
there is no reason for anyone to be afraid when the prevalence of rights over force is enshrined in the law
madam president europe is founded upon fundamental rights
fundamental rights can create identity and citizenship
quite simply freedom of movement demands a basis of guaranteed fundamental rights
enlargement of the union without guaranteed rights could even turn into a fiasco and delay our economic development
a binding charter is an indispensable requirement and a necessary part of a muchneeded constitution
these complications ought to be studied more closely
the charter should be easy to communicate to citizens and be clear to them
it should not be divided into two or contain a whole lot of references
the charter must be binding and embrace the european institutions
this project will give rise to more powerful european individuals
social fundamental rights form part and parcel of traditional fundamental rights
there are social fundamental rights which by their very nature are identical to and as such simply form part of the traditional civil freedom rights
these rights should therefore be included in the first part of the charter
these are however no less essential to the charter as basic elements
this is not the case at all
no more so in actual fact than is the guarantee of freedom of expression or a fair hearing
the purpose of the charter is to incorporate these fundamental rights in the european institutions and european policy
this is in fact a reaction to a second common misconception
it is not the case that the charter would only contain rights for which the european union would be the first authorised port of call
i would also like to comment on international treaties with regard to social fundamental rights
we will need to conduct this general discussion then too
these legally binding instruments have proven to be a shot in the arm in the equal treatment of men and women in the member states
this is a misconception in my view
discrimination against women is a fact which unfortunately is inherent in our social fabric as such
this is why there is still a need to give the equal treatment principle a firm basis in law across the board
thinking in terms of a hierarchy of fundamental rights is a trap which we should avoid
the rights of women form an integral part of universal human rights fundamental rights or civil rights
specific women s rights do not exist
what does exist is mainstreaming a gender perspective in the discussion of fundamental rights
for the rest of my speech i would refer to the written version which i have yet to publish
madam president i would like above all to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the quality of their work
they have successfully stated the importance of this matter for the european parliament europe and its citizens
the area of competence of the committee on petitions justifies its interest in the framing of the charter
so our opinion stresses two key points which the rapporteurs moreover seem to share
firstly the necessary visibility of the charter as a point of reference for the citizens
this necessitates clear and concise drafting within a single comprehensible text
secondly the binding force of this charter which is achieved when it is possible to defend the recognised rights in the law court
the natural outcome of this determination is the inclusion of the future charter among the treaties
in conclusion let me say that it is necessary to make a qualitative leap in the protection of fundamental rights
this report must be a unanimous message from parliament to ensure that the council and the convention respond to the expectations of petitioners
madam president no doubt the council would like to hear the opinion of the political groups which seems to me to be very healthy
madam president we are holding this debate at exactly the right time
we are dealing with the content involving civil and political rights and then we will deal with citizenship rights and economic and social rights
fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions the member states of the european union respect fundamental rights
there is a rome convention upheld by the court in strasbourg which is the ultimate guarantee in the event of a violation
so what is this charter for
being european has an added positive effect
this is the political message which we must send
the report which we are debating today and voting on tomorrow also seems to explain very clearly what the political objectives of this parliament are
we do not wish the charter to be a mere declaration we do not believe that a declaration is sufficient
we want the charter to be incorporated into the treaties precisely because we want the citizens to have more rights and guarantees
whether or not the charter is incorporated into the treaty clearly depends on the work which the convention is able to carry out
it will depend on whether the work is useful and can be incorporated into the treaties
however it seems to me essential that parliament bears this objective in mind with regard to the drawing up of the charter
there will be no double use of the convention of strasbourg we should make this very clear
this is the background against which we are working
it is important at a time when the european union is experiencing upheaval at its very centre
the charter must contribute to this
it is intended rather to say what parliament expects of the convention
to this end i should like to stress two points
in the first place what do we expect to obtain from this exercise
we want more than this
my second point is to do with its content
this was not the purpose of today s discussion but it is worth highlighting three points
fundamental rights are of secondary importance in treaties these days
if they are included at all this is done so in a completely chaotic format
this is unacceptable certainly if europe professes to be a community of values
therefore the charter must guarantee the citizen protection against the breaches of increasingly widening supranational legislation
the echr should apply as a minimum standard with specific european union rights added to it
after all the charter must be able to form the basis for new fundamental rights if so necessitated by social developments
ladies and gentlemen the charter of fundamental rights must be an essential stage in the construction of europe
this is a formal request which we are making to the french government
there are however two points that i would like to mention here
firstly i should like to stress the need for the charter to develop the concept of european citizenship due to residence
more than ever it is essential to avoid the coexistence in europe of distinct classes of people enjoying distinct rights
this charter must make every effort to develop our definition of european citizenship based on the idea of residence
the rights that we are defining if they are to be fundamental must be applicable to everyone
well this cannot truly exist unless it is based on a solid legal standard
this is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twentyfirst century
so for the time being what i am about to say applies only to the duffvoggenhuber report
there are three reasons for our claiming that the charter as envisaged would curtail the rights of citizens
firstly on the pretext of defending citizens better it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined
it would weaken the control that they currently have over it
next the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens rights in europe
indeed i am astounded that governments are prepared to allow this to happen
have they not learnt the lessons of the past
do they really wish taking the example of the french government to have to face twenty problems such as the case of the hunters all at the same time
here we are at the heart of what we have called the process of reducing rights
if so adhesion to the charter could be shared by both existing members and future members
every country must continue to be able to choose its regulations freely in accordance with its own culture and development
we would like the intergovernmental conference which is just starting to keep the essential principle of respect for national democracies continually in mind
now then the european union does in effect seem to be a little behind but we can make up time by using this vessel
i am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework
we do not as yet know what we will put inside it
the report does of course contain some of the main points but we will have to decide upon the definitive text later on
in our opinion however we should be moving towards a europe of peoples peoples whose identity is not necessarily defined according to the present form of the member states
madam president as the low turnout during the most recent elections has shown europe as a concept does not mean a great deal to its citizens
we cannot change this by giving citizens a charter of fundamental rights
it should only include articles which can give a meaningful message to these european institutions
finally fundamental rights are based on human dignity
i therefore welcome it
the decision taken by the  has done great damage to the perception that the citizens of the european union have of europe
and i believe it is very doubtful indeed as to whether this damage can be made good by a charter of fundamental rights
the request was made at the time of the treaty of maastricht and the treaty of amsterdam
this question was raised in that document too
later on at the cologne summit parliament s wider request was also honoured
a meeting was proposed for the purpose of producing a charter of fundamental rights of the european citizen
we should not produce empty shells our citizens would see through them straight away anyway
in fact in my opinion the union should sign up to that convention without delay
it should not duplicate what is already there
i will probably submit a text on this matter myself
mr president i would just like to say a few words on the question of the incorporation of the charter into the treaties
the governments and on their behalf the council of cologne left the question open
they left a question mark over whether and how to incorporate the charter into the treaties
we feel that the intergovernmental conference is our opportunity to resolve this question and this opportunity must not be passed up
there are so to speak two parallel operations
it is the responsibility of the convention to prepare the draft charter in time for the intergovernmental conference to be able to decide whether to incorporate it into the treaties
if the charter is ready in time the intergovernmental conference will have to define the procedures for its incorporation into the treaty
the governments did something very courageous when they gave the goahead for the preparation of the charter of fundamental rights in cologne and now they should not have any regrets
they should not turn back but should exploit their decision to the full
ladies and gentlemen human rights are a constitutional issue
mr president i should like to express my substantial agreement with the point just made by mr napolitano
it is when you think of it odd to suppose that great institutions of this kind could be thought capable of existing without some constitution
manifestly we do exist and therefore manifestly we already have some kind of a constitution
the question is do we have an adequate constitution and what kind of constitution do we want
there is however one risk
if we do not succeed in that we will fail in everything
in our eagerness to make things right we are however in danger of doing a lot of damage
the eu is faced with a number of choices are we to secure our own rights
that would of course weaken the latter and damage the situation regarding human rights throughout europe
in my view the eu s court of justice should therefore be kept away from the project concerning fundamental rights
in that way the eu would reinforce the existing conventions and that is something there is a need for
that is the potential conflict which could arise between this charter and the european convention on human rights
forgetting the people social democrats hide shamefaced behind human rights and furtive liberals turn into social democrats
the nations of europe can be proud of their record on human rights however have they needed charters
but does this charter add to what we already have
does this charter simply aim to be an expensive distributor of compensation in the dreadful fullness of time
mr president why do we need such a charter
the big question is not whether we need such a charter but what status it should have
this would be a valuable exercise there is clearly a problem of awareness of people s rights
many citizens do not know the rights that exist today
a document clearly laying out such rights and making it clear where and how these rights could be exercised would be valuable
so the charter must fill in any gaps in existing rights and it must be binding on the institutions of the european union
however it is clear that not all rights will be equal at least in the way they are implemented
the rights need to be in two categories
if it is to impact on the citizen it must appear in the treaties of the european union
in my view there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject
citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another eu country
but why should we not establish some new institutions and instruments by means of this charter enabling citizens to have a real influence
it cannot and must not be without this reference
for this reason we are against it
we are not questioning the content of such a charter
we come from a country whose constitution contains one of the most extensive enumerations of fundamental rights anywhere
the europe to which we belong is even to a certain extent the cradle of the culture of fundamental rights
as there is no problem the charter is not a solution and as the charter will solve nothing it is therefore a problem in itself
firstly because it would divide us in a cause in which we should be united
this is not a plus but a minus
the appropriate setting in which to enshrine fundamental rights is the constitutional law of each nation state
in other words the universal declaration of human rights and in europe the european convention
this would ensure that they were clearly incorporated into the acquis communautaire
that would be a real step forward this charter is the wrong answer to a problem that does not even exist and is therefore an additional problem which we feel we can do without
so reads item b in the motion for a resolution we have before us
in our capacity as citizens we have freedoms and rights but we also have responsibilities
i therefore welcome the fact that responsibilities have been incorporated in accordance with my wording in item e
i would also remind you of amendments nos  and  which the group of the european people s party and european democrats have submitted and which will be voted on tomorrow
this statement totally conflicts with the un s and the council of europe s fundamental human rights charters concerning the rights of the family
however the report by duff and voggenhuber has given us cause for this today
i would particularly like to take this opportunity to highlight how doggedly they have pursued their goal
duff and voggenhuber on the other hand think of themselves as true european parliamentarians whose task it is to further the interests of europe as a whole
and so really this report could also be viewed as an appeal to the convention that goes like this dare to do something at long last
the charter is precisely the instrument we need to give europe a soul and it could help create a common identity
why is it that eu governments are so quick off the mark when it comes to pushing through economic reforms but so hesitant when it comes to political rights
do you not realise that europe as we know it will fall apart if we put all our efforts into bringing on the economy and do not do anything to promote political fundamental rights
with this in mind i hope the report in question achieves an overwhelming majority in plenary tomorrow
our group deems it particularly important that the european charter should neither replace nor infringe member states own provisions on fundamental rights
the council of europe s convention is now  years old
mr president the rapporteurs duff and voggenhuber as well as the committee on constitutional affairs have done some sterling work
the report itself is sound because it conveys the key messages without going so far as to anticipate the work of the fundamental rights convention
i therefore nurture the hope that tomorrow in plenary sitting this report will be adopted in the form we in the committee on citizens freedoms and rights drafted it in
however there is one point which i would like to be amended
i have tabled an amendment to this effect on behalf of my group
this was an important goal in the past
but that is not the path we want europe to go down in the future and nor should it
with all due respect for the human rights convention we need more
we need our own charter that provides our own answers to the questions raised by the age we live in
the european convention on human rights does not fulfil this task
it is not in a position to do so because it came into being in the s when political and social conditions were completely different
let us support them in this
in other words policy should be implemented along the lines of a directive rather than a regulation
we do it differently and no less effectively
but for those which do not it is a very radical step and in the meantime i will keep a very close watch on the united kingdom and what it may say and do about all this
that is why the theme is tiresome to so many
however i believe that it would be a big mistake for the european parliament to approve of this sort of trend
families are firmly connected with the european notion of society
like many others the christian democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility meet halfway
society may be just but it cannot ever love
its bosom is too cold and its arm too short
social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family
there can thus be no people s europe without a familyoriented europe
this is enshrined in all our constitutions as well as the constitutions of those accession countries joining the european union in enlargement
i can show you the constitutions of postcommunist states in which the family and marriage is protected
i welcome the reference in our charter to family life
part  of article  states everyone shall have the right to found a family
point  of article  states the union shall ensure the protection of children
it suggests we could add in accordance with the united nations convention on the rights of the child
the union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty
in our opinion this is a question of responsibility and also of consistency
this is not the case and that is not the purpose of all this
the charter of fundamental rights is nevertheless not intended to act as a substitute for the constitutional guarantees that we all enjoy in our own countries
no we intend to provide something which will bring added value a kind of additional guarantee which would function as an instrument of the new european citizenship
this is a real problem and one of which we should all be aware
we cannot run the risk that when this charter comes into force a new area of legal uncertainty will be created
this is a fundamental question
the third question and a crucial one is the body of rights
how far do we intend to go
how far is the union prepared to go
on this subject i should like to mention the issue of the intergovernmental conference
once again the commission would like to make four key points quite clear to parliament
the commission advocated this as long ago as  and did so again in 
the idea that the european union itself ought to sign the european convention is also largely shared by the european parliament
i would also like to clearly state a second idea
i would like to make two more observations on the list of rights
thank you very much commissioner vitorino
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
additional commission contribution to the igc
i am not very sure given the joint or parallel organisation of our work how i shall be able to do this properly
i did mention before this house our intention to outline and clarify some aspects of this opinion at a later date
we had however identified for institutional reasons with regard to extremely serious or sensitive issues five categories of exceptions requiring unanimity
this was one of them
this is the point we have discussed today in order to complete our opinion
these proposals concern the methods for decision making in matters of taxation and social security
having said that i should like to clarify three misunderstandings which sometimes arise
firstly the commission is not demanding new jurisdiction for taxation and social security
ever since the treaty of rome the treaties have provided for community action in both these areas
switching from unanimity to qualified majority is not a transfer of jurisdiction
the commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the european community
it is only the method of decision making which may change
this is the first point that i wished to make clear
the second point i would like to make is that the commission does not wish to impose the levelling of national tax systems or social security systems
finally the commission wishes to make it clear that this additional presentation does not encompass its entire programme for years to come in all areas
my fellow commissioners mrs diamantopoulou and mr bolkestein will inform you when the time comes regarding the various aspects of the commission programme
i should now like to mention the principles which oriented our approach in the document which you are to receive shortly
let me say again unanimity is to remain the general rule
the commission therefore considers it justifiable to retain unanimity in these areas as a basic principle
we confirm this approach
moreover these national choices are generally  let me specify  generally neutral with regard to the construction of europe
this is the first principle
that is the second principle
finally my third principle we must in future select the best instrument to respect subsidiarity
but this selection of the best instrument must be limited to that which is strictly necessary
we also consider it important to introduce it to the field of taxation too
still before answering your questions i would like briefly to mention the content of the proposals as you will read them
for the remainder unanimity shall remain the general rule
we further propose to retain unanimity for decisions on tax rates and the points of taxation
in so doing we are seeking to achieve coherence
we must avoid penalising them
the commission undertook to carry out clear proactive work
we eliminated any ideological thinking
mr president firstly i would like to welcome the commission s approach in general to the igc
the fact that we are getting this rolling presentation of more detailed explanations of issues is very helpful
secondly i agree with the commission that this is indeed an extremely delicate issue
taxation and social security get to what mrs thatcher used to call the nooks and crannies of everyday life
from what i hear the commission has got it more or less right and i would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity
that makes absolute sense
what i was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work
how will that be defined
it sounds fine but how do you define a measure that is essential to make the single market work
that is a matter of intense debate
i wish him well in this area because it is an area in which we need a breakthrough
the text will as soon as it has been adopted  as is now the case  be made available towards the end of the afternoon
to quote but one example the country of origin principle in matters of vat
or another example double taxation which causes so many problems
thank you very much commissioner for your comments
i do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers
are you aware sir that the leader of the british conservative party has said that we have reached the limits of european integration
commissioner i should like to pick up on a point which you made in your speech
mr rubig in answering i shall focus on the matter of vat
i must answer that it depends what you mean by great vat modernisation project 
jointly with the member states we are currently identifying what should go into this package
this is why we recommend an extremely thorough and i might almost say clinical analysis of these matters in the interests of the internal market
finally i would like to thank professor tsatsos for having mentioned the connection between these proposals and the role of the european parliament
mr president commissioner barnier i am extremely pleased that the commission has produced this initiative
those who deny this call the future of the internal market into question
these are clearly two basic taxes that we are going to have to harmonise in some way
i do not know if you included this under tax evasion it does not feature in your document at any rate
could you comment on this
mr president i have to say that i am most impressed by the principles which the commissioner has set out
 subparagraph  concerning the cancellation of contracts of employment i have difficulty in seeing what the justification is for this on the basis of the three principles which have been laid down and which have been emphasised by the commission
in the light of this may i conclude that the commissioner does not wish to comply with the presidency s note on these proposals
commissioner you are proceeding with the utmost caution and that is an approach which i support
the concept of citizenship is common property on behalf of which we must move beyond failures such as helsinki
i have three specific questions that i would like to ask you
my second question is does the instrument that you are proposing in the area of environmental taxation provide for qualified majority voting
it does strike very much at the heart of what is perceived as the national ability to conduct one s affairs
i hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through
are there any circumstances where the commission would seek to use qualified majority voting on any of those issues
can you guarantee that the commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues
mr president i can imagine that according to some members the citizens are sensitive to european intervention in tax and social matters
this is why i would like to direct two specific questions to the commissioner
could the commissioner tell me if the present issue is also affected by qualified majority voting
i should like to answer a number of you collectively particularly on what we might term the tax package
mr leinen discussed this as did mr baltas and just now mrs van lancker
obviously the monti package is related to the proper operation of the internal market
this is why mr monti a few months ago and now my fellow commissioner frits bolkestein continue to make it a political priority
we do wish to include them as beneficiaries of social policy articles  and  which are to be subject to qualified majority voting
in nice prior to the great enlargement i would ask you please to see this text as anticipating events
as we exist right now we could continue to operate more or less and to live together but that is not what it is all about
we wish to ensure that the community has effective means to support this restructuring at community level
finally i should like to tell mr jonckheer that for all sorts of reasons i absolutely agree with him on the matter of citizenship
i am aware that my answers are necessarily incomplete given the time available
mr bolkestein mrs diamantopoulou and myself will have the opportunity to address you again in future
but in the final analysis as we all know what we need is the political will
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
first part
question no  by h
this definition does not in any way affect the status of western sahara and its coastal waters
i would like to start by thanking the commissioner for his kind answer although i find it to be completely insufficient
however you have expressed it with extreme clarity
if it cannot have sovereignty over the territory neither can it have sovereignty over its coastal waters
what situation would the government of the western sahara then be in with regard to the waters which it would have the sovereign duty to administrate
does the commission commit itself to formally consulting the secretarygeneral of the united nations
yes or no commissioner
that is a question which is being considered at the moment in the context of the referendum and of the un secretarygeneral s initiative
that also goes of course for his special representative
question no  by h
what provisions will be taken to ensure that ngos enjoy effective access to union funding
i hope you will excuse me that in answering the questions together i take slightly longer
i am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to mr van den bos on antipersonnel mines today
i will also take this opportunity to respond to madame carlotti s question
antipersonnel mines create appalling casualties in many of the poorest parts of the world
over the past eight years european community support for mine action has exceeded eur  million
we have intervened in all corners of the world
we have supported action by national authorities international organisations and not least ngos
but until now we have not had a coherent overall approach to our mine action
mine clearance and other forms of mine action are often a preliminary step to any sensible development programme
therefore they should form part of national or regional reconstruction and rehabilitation plans
we have signed up to the objective of eliminating all landmines worldwide in ten to fifteen years
that will require determination consistency and perseverance
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply which i find extremely satisfactory
it indicates the commission s high level of commitment to this issue
thank you very much commissioner for this comprehensive answer
might i ask you to clarify one point
one thing that we obviously need to do is to advertise very clearly what is available
we intend establishing a multiannual work plan
we will refer to that on our website
i hope therefore that ngos will feel involved in what we are doing
we depend a great deal on their active support and understanding
but overall i can assure the honourable member that we will be involving ngos as much as possible
they have a great deal to contribute to this important work
question no  by h
subject dialogue on europe initiative the president of the commission intends to launch this initiative on  march 
the commission s communication on the subject implies that the intention is to explain the consequences of the igc  to the public opinion of the fifteen
this is completely justified given the actual purpose of the charter of fundamental rights
mr president i would first of all like to thank the commission for its reply i am satisfied with it for two reasons
i am pleased to hear the commissioner s comments on the charter
i would like to push him to give details about the nature of the campaign
last wednesday we had a very successful launch of the european information campaign involving commissioners and members of the european parliament
after all it is the meps who are supposed to represent the citizens
we are at least as wellplaced as the commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens
the answer to mr martin s question is yes  and i can include mr barnier and mr vitorino in that
the simple answer mr president is yes 
question no  by h
mr fischler will reply on behalf of mrs wallstrom
i should like to thank the commissioner for his answer
i would like to hear your views on the matter commissioner do you intend to take action for the economic ecological and cultural restoration of the areas which were damaged
the key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established
as far as the financial aspect is concerned the commission is in the process of looking into which funds could be made available for an emergency aid package
commissioner thank you for your answer
and not just these reactors but also the reactors in slovakia and lithuania
of course i appreciate that there are certain difficulties involved in closing them down immediately but is that the earliest possible date
mr trakatellis opinion is extremely divided as to how unsafe the reactors  and  actually are
now it is up to me who i believe
it must be left to the country concerned to determine how to implement the objectives set as quickly as possible
as a matter of fact i believe we achieved a particularly positive outcome in bulgaria in view of the extremely difficult situation there
i would like to point something else out to you somewhat circuitously but you will soon see why
as far as the shutdown dates for blocks and  are concerned it says in the text that this will be decided on in 
so that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind
that is all i can say on the matter but i think you know what i am driving at
questions to mr lamy
question no  by h
as lldcs account for less than  of world trade will he reconsider his reservations in this respect
what timetable does he propose for the implementation of this measure
in its conclusions dating from june  the council made reference to the expression essentially all the products of lldcs 
the difference between all and essentially all products affects as we well know a number of specific agricultural products
this is the mandate which the commission was given and therefore naturally we must respect it
my own services are currently preparing proposals which will be presented to the council when they are completely ready
i am thinking particularly of the markets of the developed countries the united states japan australia and new zealand
i am also thinking possibly of a number of emerging countries already industrialised
that is the state of play at the present time
this is the response i wished to give to this question which looks to the future
i am grateful to commissioner lamy for his answer as far as it went
what more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned and for how long
that is the sort of message we want to hear
we do not want to wait for five years let others follow our example
there are two parts to my answer to this question
i am thinking particularly of sugar which can effectively constitute an additional resource for several of these countries
you know that the community and in this case the commission has considered the idea of a complete review of conditions in the sugar industry
these are matters to which we shall no doubt return
but that is something that only we need concern ourselves with
question no  by h
mr clegg the commission acknowledges that the agreement on china s accession to the wto is an extremely important decision
this would mean that parliament should have the opportunity pursuant to article  to declare its opinion on this agreement
obviously in the normal course of things it is up to the council to consult the european parliament
this is the legal and institutional answer to your question mr clegg
thank you very much for that reply
i would urge you to do so
i would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action
having said that i feel that the comparison you make with the uruguay round is not totally justified
that is perfectly normal i feel and i look forward to it
my question however concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement
this is a good question
i remember using this expression contrasting  and 
that still leaves  however and for a very simple reason
that is the first reason
there is another more technical reason involving some subtle points
although the designations are fairly similar there may be very different tariff items
these are more technical considerations but they show that all these aspects must be looked into and negotiated in detail
it is not quite over yet
these concern the political section with regard to which the chinese authorities have expressed a number of reservations
my mandate at present is to attempt to overcome these reservations and i shall make every effort to do so
thank you very much mr lamy
the time allotted to mr lamy has fully elapsed question no  will therefore be replied to in writing
questions to mr fischler
question no  by h
the commissioner has not been explicit
however his services the commission and some of us meps all know that there are studies and estimates covering this issue
the commissioner is at times the master of sidestepping the question with all the skill of a bullfighter and failing to provide an answer
however the commission if it wants the countryside to support its positions must clear the fog and be explicit
therefore the comparison you have just drawn is inappropriate to my mind
secondly these are two completely different questions
in your question which i answered you asked what enlargement will cost
the question as to whether the common agricultural policy will be amended in the course of enlargement is an entirely different matter
in addition a financial perspective was adopted in berlin ie we decided how much money we could spend
we are in the process of carrying out new studies and as soon as we have the results we will be more than happy to make them available to you
question no  by h
question no  by h
can the commission say what studies it has carried out on the possibility of transferring quotas and what the outcome was
what decisions have been taken to balance the financial cost of agreements with the north and south
what is the commission s assessment of the abovementioned imbalances between these two types of agreement
i actually referred to this at the beginning of my answer
you mentioned the council
that is why we must overcome this problem
that is no way to solve the problem
we must draw a distinction
there is little point in doing that in our view
question no  by h
is the export aid which has been made available by the french government compatible with article 
if so could such aid be extended to cover timber exports to third countries
the notification from the french government includes a measure intended to facilitate the transportation of wood from the affected regions
understandably therefore the commission has asked the french government for additional information
i should like to ask the commissioner to clarify his answer
obviously such aid is already officially provided for in the countries of the community
my question clearly concerned exports outside the common market outside the union
we can only apply existing community law in such cases
in other words firstly there has to be evidence of damage and secondly a direct link has to be established
this would be a clear distortion of the market
in fact this proposal met with the approval of a majority of the management committee
that being the case it will be possible to fulfil all the contracts concluded in the member states
this meant that germany s original allocation of   hectolitres could be increased to   hectolitres
that is what the contracts concluded in germany amounted to in total
the amended regulation on preventive distillation will be published in the official journal in the near future and will be made retrospective to  february
question no  by h
what immediate action does the commission intend to take in order to expedite such an agreement
in any event the final decision in this respect is the responsibility of the member states
with regard to the transeuropean networks we cannot include anything which is not supported by the member states
today the works on the road route are already under way
we are right therefore to ask questions about the future
there is no doubt that crossing the great mountain ranges of the european union is a problem
however the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the member states
i would also like to know since you have mentioned it when the commission communication on the report on the alps and the pyrenees will be made available
since you have asked the state which has opposed it until now is france
it is clearly the countries of the iberian peninsular which have the greatest interest here
safety aspects are also important given the use of extensive tunnels
question no  by h
subject bloodalcohol limits for drivers since  the commission has been advocating community legislation concerning maximum blood alcohol limits for drivers
in  the commission stated that it was necessary to reduce the number of road casualties and increase road safety
the eu is at present adopting legislation to promote mobility and road safety
i must point out however that although the commission intends to express this type of guideline it will do so by means of a recommendation
alcohol constitutes the second greatest danger to health in the eu according to a report on health produced by a highlevel working party
i should also like to put a following question to the commissioner
most countries apply a level of  mg
we are going to present a communication on road safety which you in this parliament will receive shortly and recommend a maximum limit of  mg
we consider that legislation should be reserved for cases where it is absolutely necessary to legislate
this is an important issue that is often left out when we are talking about driving
will this ever be put into the recommendation
the problem is obviously that drugs produce states which clearly limit drivers response capacities
question no  by h
subject veronamunich railway link the project for a new veronamunich through railway line has been under discussion for years
traffic on the veronamunich route is increasing yet only one third of the capacity of the existing railway line is being used
to achieve this motorway tolls for goods vehicles must be increased and a fast and efficient railway line must be provided
if a new line is built care must be taken to select the option that has the least damaging impact on the environment
as the infrastructure is supposed to last for hundreds of years it is essential to find the best solution
it appears that the commission favours the brenner base tunnel project
why does the commission not intend to reconsider the alternative att project put forward by the engineers trojer and kauer
has the commission studied the potential environmental impact of the various projects for a veronamunich rail link
can the commission finance a further study of the question of the transport of goods via the brenner
in principle it largely follows the route of the current conventional line
the proposal of the att  project which is well known to the commission deviates from the route established in the guidelines of the transeuropean network
all we need is a ban on transiting heavy goods traffic
amongst other things in order to ban heavy transport the first thing we need is an alternative route for heavy transport
the truth is that there is currently no such alternative
therefore the first thing we have to do is suitably develop the corresponding routes
of course all of this is linked to our society and its development
this is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected
the fact that this request came from the greens makes it all the more baffling and it should be thrown out for this reason
thank you very much commissioner
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the commission
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
ecolabel
mr president as you just said this is the second reading for the directive on the awarding of the ecolabel
the european ecolabel is it has to be said a product of the internal market
and this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip
i am of the opinion that the meaningfulness of a european label which is tailored to the european internal market is beyond dispute
however it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation
i think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label
the test procedures which companies and their products must go through in order to obtain the label are long and costly
in this regard i should cite for example emas and iso 
in addition to a reduction in costs for certain enterprises the report also envisages a maximum fee
in this we are following the example of almost all the national labelling systems which also have this ceiling
the purpose of this approach is to make the labelling system equally attractive to large consumer goods manufacturers and service providers
we must also clearly understand that without a certain amount of financial impetus for the european label we will not make any headway
in my opinion we should take on the responsibility for this financing
another important point in this second reading is the regulation of the relationship between the national ecolabel and the european equivalent
in some states national labels are well established and enjoy public recognition
this is the case for example as regards the nordic swan in scandinavia and the blue angel in germany
our approach should be different
both groups however have one thing in common they want the ecolabel to succeed
and it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the european union

economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future
if we can achieve this then we will have globalised an important environmental principle
it would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the european label even more quickly and effectively
an important issue is the involvement of nongovernmental organisations and associations
it is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process
this can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer
the aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations
there is much to be said on the question of fees
overall we must succeed in establishing the european label in member states which do not have their own label
the path which we are taking is the correct one but a recognised common european label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area
those who argue the case for having only the one ecolabelling system are making a big mistake i believe
it is about getting the consumer to look for and to choose ecolabelled products once purchasing behaviour has been altered it is extremely simple
if these groups are involved in the right way ecolabelling will also develop very much more quickly
if you would allow me to make a point of order
it is therefore especially important that the idea of prohibiting national ecolabels has been abandoned
i also believe it is important to realise that there is nothing to prevent the existence of parallel ecolabels
our experience shows that the labels would in that way be given greater credibility
moreover this system functions excellently where it has been introduced
we are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned
i also think it is good that the idea of a graded ecolabel has been done away with
it is easier just to have the picture of a flower
we are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector too
only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream
the ecolabel should not be associated with mediocrity
the german blue angel and the nordic swan have led the way in ecolabelling
to scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water
ecolabelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances but why stop there
services such as tourism and clean taxes could register
in addition groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together
it ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers distributors and consumers
the proposal also reinforces the interested parties role and participation
we are therefore able to accept these amendments
we are therefore able to approve these amendments too
the commission supports this overarching objective
the commission is able to support this amendment too
to summarise the commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments
they are only to be found in english
this applies for example to amendments  and 
these are only available in english which is totally unacceptable
if we are to be able to vote on this report these amendments need at least to be read out before they are voted on
that was the first point
the second concerns for example the work programme for environmental strategy
the president cut the speaker off
thank you very much for pointing out the position regarding amendments
the services are looking at this and i hope that they will be ready in time for tomorrow
we cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time
thank you commissioner for your contribution
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
incineration of waste
on amendments nos  and  which have been distributed i am shown as the joint mover of the motion
i then asked for this to be corrected dg refused saying that they did not have the time
i should like to say that i think this is completely unacceptable
they have had more than  hours in which to correct the amendments concerned
i feel very put out that these have been made publicly available with wrong information about who the movers of the motion are
it is a question then of amendments nos  and  of which i am not the joint mover of the motion
thank you very much for pointing that out
we will try and make sure it is corrected by tomorrow
mr president commissioner first of all i would like to thank the members for their fruitful cooperation
as a result of this we have been able to table various amendments in a joint effort and reach agreement on a number of issues
this is illustrated by the compromise we reached on the scope of the directive
i would also like to thank the european commission for providing the information and technical advice which was extremely helpful
in a civilised society it is to be expected that waste should be processed in an effective and environmentally responsible manner
in the european community this will increasingly be done by incinerating waste and recycling energy
this process will obviously need to be closely monitored for emissions of dangerous substances
it should however be noted that stricter requirements are already in place in a number of member states
it is one thing to prescribe sound environmental standards but quite another to comply with these
compliance requires adequate control which in turn requires proper monitoring
we would then run the risk of not on balance making any progress and the quality of air would not improve
mr florenz was among those who were right to point out that clear measuring regulations are vital
i expect therefore that we will be joining forces in order to put a sound monitoring process in place
regarding the definition of coincineration plant it is unfortunate that we were unable to reach agreement on this beforehand
after many discussions involving various members and the european commission a simple solution which may well be acceptable has been found in the form of amendment no 
if on the other hand only part of the waste were to be used as a replacement raw material then this process would fall within the directive s scope
the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured
it is wrong however that the standards for ammonia should not apply to all installations
as far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned this appears to be quite feasible
belgium has started to use such a measuring technique in the wake of its dioxin crisis
a cumulative sample is taken for a onemonth period
after this period this sample is measured and the result gives a good indication of the levels of dioxin emitted during that month
needless to say this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year
according to experts the costs are not higher since the measurement of cumulative samples is far cheaper
as such the cost of the equipment for continuous sampling is recouped within the space of a few years
at first reading considerable improvements were made to the commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support
it was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens
i strongly urge meps to meet these expectations
this raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process the reception processing and handling of the waste
one might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters
we can find the answer in mr blokland s report which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry
paradoxically however by the same token the rapporteur is in favour of mixing dangerous and nondangerous waste
what is the advantage of this for the environment
the practices of each member state must be taken into consideration while maintaining the existing industrial balance and investigating how the environment can be better protected
this is what the common position proposes
priority must be given to the emission limits for the most harmful substances ie nox dioxins and furanes
as regards dioxins and furanes the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste
until now they applied only to nondangerous waste
if one wishes to go too far one becomes counterproductive
what the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods
commissioner waste management in europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency
mr president i should like to begin by congratulating mr blokland on this report
moreover there are also some good resources which are being put to use
it is a balance that i hope will be maintained including during the vote tomorrow here in the plenary sitting
mr president mr blokland has carried out an enormous task
this subject is incredibly involved
moreover the lobbyists have been something else
i should never have believed that there were so many of them concerned about waste in europe
you might have thought it was gold rather than waste they were talking about
obviously the eu must create a sustainable system for protecting air land and water
this is a common commitment and a common responsibility
it clearly ought too to be regulated at european union level
we must look at the whole hierarchy
this parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent
so we must set the highest possible standards and not make exceptions which will weaken this very important legislation
it has a habit of reappearing often in a more harmful form
incineration can be the cause of illnesses air pollution climatic change and a rise in the sea level
a great deal of waste is incinerated these days but not in fact by these expensive installations equipped with fluegas cleaning devices
these installations are not being brought up to date
in fact they are closed down if it appears that it is cheaper to coincinerate waste in the cement industry and in electricity plants
this issue however should form an exception
amendments of this kind reduce the directive to rules for those who would poison us and threaten the world with another flood
the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left therefore supports the proposals made by mr blokland and hopes that destructive amendments will be withdrawn or rejected
regrettably our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste
mr president commissioner firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work
we should treat this seriously
we cannot in any way guarantee that in restricting coincineration we will actually achieve what we want environmentally
above all we want to save fossil fuels
if we set up the hurdles wrong here then we will not achieve the right environmental objective
however i think that there are still some amendments decided on in committee which we can support in good conscience in order to improve the common position
i do believe that mr blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons
we cannot say that it is all wrong
indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance
we have to expect that it will take time to implement this report
mr blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given
if one is being kind to this directive one could describe it as being good in parts like the curate s egg
unfortunately this is going to give environment policy a bad name
we should not be constantly reregulating incinerators
we should be seeking ways to avoid incineration in the first place
if we do not we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again
mr president i certainly agree with mr bowe s final summary
we have to concentrate on reducing waste recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort
will his position remain the same when he is debating the packaging directive
it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there
the only thing incineration does as mrs evans has said is to encourage the need for more waste
it will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going
we also must remember that waste does not disappear
it is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash  what will you do with that
in ireland some operators are proposing using it in building materials
what will be the longterm consequences of that
in ireland regardless of what my colleague mr hyland said we have an appalling record on waste management
we have one of the highest landfill records in europe
now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option
the recent court case in ireland which decided against the siting of an incinerator in an agricultural area was extremely important
it is very important that we get our act right that we look first and foremost at waste management
for any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided
we have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place
in finland and some other countries the sorting of waste in close proximity to where it originates is very advanced
thus we do not incinerate mixed waste as they do in certain countries
the incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy
sorted waste can be incinerated effectively together with other fuels in a socalled coincineration process
for that reason amendments nos    and  should not be adopted
both processes satisfy the criteria of best practicable environmental option and are accepted by environmental inspectors in the united kingdom
have they received any representations from united kingdom ministers
i have given the commissioner notice of these questions
this waste is an important energy source not only for the industrial plants themselves but also for the surrounding community
i am mainly worried about the socalled coincineration of waste
there are many amendments in the report that are problematic
it is unacceptable for pollution to be transferred from the air into water and the ground
the directive makes some headway in that direction
nevertheless the problems inherent in waste incineration still remain since it is the actual burning process which produces toxic substances including dioxins
this applies even more to domestic waste which contains negligible quantities of toxic substances before it is burned
treating dangerous and nondangerous waste in the same way therefore exacerbates the problem
mr president i would like to thank mr blokland for this report he has had a very hard job to do
this should not be happening
mrs paulsen was right this is exactly where compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is needed
there are no alternative proposed uses for waste it would be deposited in landfill sites
that will add to the formation of methane as a result of putrefaction of organic waste and the greenhouse phenomenon
this holds true especially for the incineration of harmless sludge produced by the paper and cellulose industry
another example is the call for the ongoing monitoring of the ammonia content of gas from chimneys
mr president mr blokland ladies and gentlemen waste management is a complex task
this is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying
the majority decided in favour of coincineration
my opinion is that today we must fight to prevent the emission standards for dangerous waste being relaxed
the volume of waste to be incinerated is going to be significantly increased
the debate has focused on coincineration
and this is important and necessary
nevertheless i must say that mr blokland is proposing some regulations and stringent conditions for the directive which go way beyond the objective
a further point is to ensure that the directive does not give rise to any protected markets
many companies are also dependent on the use of waste to retain competitiveness and jobs
millions have already been spent on measures to reduce energy consumption
in my opinion we should not disregard these efforts 
the president cut the speaker off
the first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry
these incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants
we need the specialist toxic waste incinerators
there are only three at the moment in the united kingdom
the second point i would make is to underline the point made by dr jackson
i come from a region in the united kingdom with the highest density of pigs
if these incinerators are not used people may well have to go back to burial
the proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation the protection of public health
the proposal will help reduce dioxin emissions from incineration by  per cent
i should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste hierarchy
it is therefore obvious that in this case it is recycling that one should attempt in the first place to regulate
unfortunately mr bowe it has been  years since the technical requirements in these directives were last reviewed
 amendments have been tabled
of these the commission is able to approve eight in full five in part and three in principle
the following amendments are aimed at clarifying the commission s proposal
the commission is not able to approve the first section of amendment no 
the second section of this amendment is in principle acceptable
by introducing an explanation of the word untreated  the paragraph can be made less ambiguous
the amendments would involve the provisions in these acts being duplicated or becoming more ambiguous
amendments nos    and  are not compatible with the directive s structure and cannot therefore be approved
this amendment cannot however be adopted by the commission
articles  and  of the proposal concern access to information and reporting
they are now worded in such a way as to guarantee that all players have access to the information they require
the commission therefore considers that amendments nos  and  are unnecessary
amendments nos  are designed to tighten up the requirements with regard to measurements
this is also justified from the point of view of costincome analysis
the commission cannot therefore accept amendments nos         and 
we consequently accept this principle
nor does it sound as if one should be burning them at home in one s backyard
i am looking at article  and i cannot see that exclusion set out there
it talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals
however i will get clarification from the commissioner personally
as things stand all other animal waste is covered by article av of the directive and directive 
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  noon
ozone in ambient air
commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic
in particular representatives of the mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy
the number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted but that is something to negotiate only when necessary
it is a good target and if it is at all possible then it should be retained
but equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive
that is why i am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the industry committee s position
i think we have put forward a reasonable compromise here
we hope that you will consent to it
mr president i should first of all like to thank mr chris davies for this report
i think there are two crucial points here
the first is that the who s guidelines should be adhered to
i think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives
as mr davies also mentioned standards are in actual fact lower than those in the united states
i think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible
i would therefore very much recommend that we support the commission s proposal together with mr davies report
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to congratulate mr davies on his excellent report
i would also like to thank the european commission for its sound green proposals
back in july  strasbourg was labouring under ozone smog
the european commission s proposal has made a lot of headway in this direction
ozone smog is still on the increase
it is now even permeating the southern european skies during the winter months
ozone smog is now to be found everywhere in europe
ozone is always an aggressive substance
there are no safe ozone levels despite what the world health organisation claims
this is why the green group proposes allowing just fifteen exceedances of critical loads per annum
my group can also support the twenty exceedances proposed by the committee
however it cannot back the proposal made by the christian democrats and unice employers union of forty such incidents per annum
this is the topic of mrs myller s report
in the case of an ozone alert we also need to be able to take shortterm action
the dutch government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this
for my group the car is no sacred cow
mr president i too wish to thank mr davies for the report he has prepared
it is an extremely important report especially from a health perspective
this especially applies to the situation in southern europe
it is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone
the reasons have to be sought in traffic levels in industrial processes and in energy production
it is also these matters which we can influence by means of the directives concerned
we know that the risks are greatest for people who are in the open air a great deal especially children
we know that exceedance of ozone limits directly affects children s lung capacity
within the european union we have achieved a certain amount of success when it comes to improving air quality
nonetheless ozone still constitutes one of the most serious environmental problems
if we are to be able to solve this problem we need to take measures with clearly defined subsidiary objectives
programmes for reducing emissions are necessary in those cases where the target values are not attained
the proposal is nonetheless a clear expression of the political will that exists to attain the longterm objectives in the directive too
attaining the world health organisation s target values is only the first step
the commission is able wholly to approve amendments nos       and 
we cannot however accept that shortterm measures should only be taken at local level
the commission is able to approve the principles behind amendments  and 
we are going to redraft subparagraph c in order to take account of the idea behind the last section of amendment no  and amendments nos  and 
amendment no  can be approved in principle
the principle in amendment no  is also acceptable
the commission agrees that climate changes ought to be emphasised
amendment no  advocates coordination between member states and applicant states
this can in principle be approved but some rewording is required if misinterpretations are to be avoided
we cannot however approve amendment no 
this is an issue on which practical considerations and the possibility of practical implementation must be taken into account
finally we must reject the first and third sections of amendment no  together with amendments nos  and 
in addition the commission cannot accept amendment no 
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken at  noon tomorrow
atmospheric pollutants
the legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right however
we are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely
for this reason it is reasonable to proceed in stages as the commission has proposed
owing to this i have recommended in my report a longterm goal in addition to the interim one and a final target for 
in place of reached it should say exceeded 
i hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow s vote
how then do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature
there is a clear difference between this proposal and the commission s
it has to be said however that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved
why did the commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later
the industry committee urges this house to vote in favour of the amendments which are tabled in my name and in the name of mr bowe
these are the amendments passed by the industry committee
the un ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time
the industry committee wishes to see these limits fully and properly implemented across the european union and globally
support the purvis amendments and the united nations gothenburg table of national emission ceilings
research into the question has been going on for  years
if we had been a little quicker off the mark the present directive would have been on the table  signed sealed and delivered  long before the socalled gothenburg protocol
the impossibility lies therefore not in the directive but in the current situation
mr president my congratulations to mrs myller who i know has thought long and hard about this report
others have not even used the same methodology the same basis of calculation as others
so the protocol in many ways is a nonsense
it can give us no confidence whatsoever
it is a messy political compromise and nothing more
we should support this report and give her our backing
but in any case it is important that the european parliament should now defend at least that policy which the commission has chosen
we want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions
this could even be done in a costeffective way as is evident from the explanatory note to the commission proposal
these values however are the result of a political compromise between states and the results of the model used by the commission have been overlooked
this model is sound and the results are well founded
mr president commissioner firstly i too would like to thank the rapporteur
many are saying that it cannot be implemented using current technology or only at an exorbitant cost
the commission itself says that the proposal can be implemented cost effectively
in my opinion this is not ambitious if anything the opposite
we in this house have always agreed that we must reduce the proportion of fossil fuels and that we must save energy
if we do not achieve this then this is a declaration of environmental bankruptcy

this cannot happen within the context of collective environmental responsibility
i will support it tomorrow in the vote and i hope that the majority of the house will do the same
mr president i certainly welcome this report and i gave it a lot of support in the environment committee
i creates a proper framework in which we can work in the long term to reduce emissions
the vast majority of the amendments i can support
i want to come to the issue which mr davies has addressed namely where we should start from
with what targets are we to start
it seems to me that the commission figures are aspirational
mr president commissioner i have of course nothing against the principle of the directive
it is an important instrument for future environmental policy
the member states are given a clearer brief
they know what they should be aiming for
upon examination of the table with the different ceilings for each member state however i get the impression that there are double standards
that is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices
a small country is not in a position to do this
i shall give you an example
that is eight times less this is partly due to the fact that we are a small country and we are surrounded by polluters
one per cent of the gdp per annum is too much of a strain for my country
acidification leads to the death or reduced growth of forests and causes fish to die and fewer plants to grow
acidified water also releases heavy metals which constitute a health problem
the countryside in the nordic countries is particularly vulnerable to acidification because these countries are largely lacking in means to protect themselves against it
acidification occurs due to acid rain caused by air polluting emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels
we are making major efforts to add lime to lakes and wetlands
we are for the most part complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive
we are therefore appealing for your help
i am convinced that the eu can be better than the un at solving the environmental problems in europe
we ought therefore to have a common interest in applauding the present eu draft directive
previously atmospheric pollution used to be associated with roads and traffic
today however on a large scale it refers to the whole world and on a small scale it even means the house we live in
in short it means our whole ecosystem and action must be taken
furthermore it estimates the costs for each member state of complying with these limits
i think that this is a good strategy
all of this seems quite reasonable
nevertheless i must ask a question here
would this not be wise
however i also understand those views that advocate electing the ceilings proposed under the gothenburg protocol
it is important that the environmental objectives are achieved as costeffectively as possible throughout the whole community
air quality in europe has improved considerably in recent years
emission levels have decreased significantly at least in the energy sector in transport and in industry
these two goals are not in my opinion mutually exclusive
the gothenburg protocol is a step forward
however it is nowhere near enough
the protocol goes only halfway towards the goal for acidification already agreed by parliament and the council
a substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the commission
we cannot let this deflect the community from agreed goals
they amount to only  of community gdp in the year 
saying that the ceilings are too difficult is dangerously close to ignoring kyoto
let me now turn to the amendments
the commission can accept fully amendments nos      and 
the commission can accept in part the principle underlying amendments nos  and 
we will also include a reference in article  of the directive in order to make the new recital operational
it follows that the commission does not accept amendment no 
the commission can also accept in part amendment no  which would make further changes to article 
the commission cannot however agree to bring forward the dates for reports to parliament and council
in  the commission will have almost no data from member states on which to report and base any decisions
the commission will not know in  whether or not ceilings were met in  because of the time that must be allowed for member states to compile inventories
we accept in part the principles underlying amendment no 
we will therefore redraft article  to incorporate much of the material in the proposed amendment
the commission accepts the principles of amendment no 
the commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying amendments nos  and 
allowance should be made for the fact that smaller member states have less room to spread the load
the commission can accept that part of amendment no  that would insert an appropriate into recital 
we do not accept the remainder of amendment no 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos    and 
gothenburg ceilings fall far short of what is needed as has already been said
we cannot therefore accept amendment no 
amendments nos   and  are also unacceptable
the commission must reject amendment no 
the commission cannot accept amendment no 
it is based on a misleading comparison with the solvents directive where processes may involve high temperatures
the proposed definition is identical in the gothenburg protocol
we must maintain technical consistency
the commission cannot accept amendment no 
it would remove an essential obligation for member states regularly to update emission inventories
finally mr president we do not accept amendment no 
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
environmental legislation
mr president i would like on behalf of the committee to move at least one of the oral questions
first of all i sympathise with the commissioner s desire to get better implementation of european union law
that is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see
i want to quote from an article in the united kingdom sunday telegraph this last sunday
that is a question which my german colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up
the environment committee is very interested in finding ways of incorporating environmental considerations into other policies
the question is is this a constitutionally viable way of doing that
what we are exploring here tonight in this crowded house is the question of linkage
that is something which we find reflected in the views not only of some of the german members here tonight but also in some of my british colleagues
such possibilities have arisen in the past especially in relation to major infrastructure projects
the fault lies with those member states which have failed to observe the directive and that includes my own
if doubt hangs over their entitlement to structural funds that is the fault of national governments
i would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this
i also find it encouraging that the commission is consequently taking care that eu legislation is being implemented
all the same in the case of the ffh directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and i can see obvious weak points
revision of the ffh directive including the current difficulties in implementation should not i think be excluded
to date the commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the ffh directive
does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas
in my opinion this is a very problematic course of action
the eu has a quite different means of enforcing sanctions ie the european court of justice
what will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen above all in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the structural fund
what sanctions will the commission then impose for nonimplementation of eu environment law
i would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here
at the moment i am more interested in protected areas for delegates but that is another matter
our question to you commissioner has another purpose
i would have liked to hear your answer first but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate
we are discussing something here of which most know the history
the faunaflorahabitats legislation should have been implemented by   it is now the year 
the european union list of the relevant nature conservation sites should have been ready in   it is now the year 
the member states should have notified the commission of their sites by   it is now the year 
many member states including my own did not do as required
germany for example implemented the legislation in  instead of   only four years late
but what does it matter
as a result the european union list is obviously not ready
and how could it be
many member states and many regions have not announced their sites
now mr schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the faunaflorahabitats directive
if that were the case then there would also be areas and matters which you and i would not like
but we do have this unfortunate system in the european union  what you call legal certainty
it must be observed
however i do not want to pass sentence on mr schnellhardt who comes from one of the new federal states who do not have things quite so good
you must do it
if you think the legislation is no good let us revise it
if you think it is sound go to the european court of justice and be quick about it
mr president it is a pleasure to face the commissioner for the fifth time today at this unearthly hour
i congratulate her for her efforts in trying to make sure that the habitats directive and associated directives are properly implemented
i wish her well
if that is the case then it is good news indeed
in fact it is a position in which i too find myself to some extent
some simple questions how long is the commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act
just how much must member states do to meet her requirements
that is the balance i suppose
let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings
contrary to the suggestion in one of the oral questions this does not represent a new obligation on the member states
in fact it is based closely on the previous framework regulation on the structural funds for the programming period 
the structural funds regulation has been approved by the member states and the council
it intends to monitor the situation in the member states including the use of onthespot checks
of course all this is in addition to the ongoing infringement procedures against a number of member states for their failure to implement these directives
we will use the means at our disposal to ensure that they honour the commitments that they have entered into
one more word on the habitats directive
the commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive
the directive is intended to establish a frame of reference which in accordance with the subsidiarity principle leaves the detailed implementation to the member states
socalled shadow lists can only help in efforts to identify sites inside the member states
you are now going back on that principle you are going back to the member states to ask them to provide the lists
they are seriously late
they have completely failed to meet the requirements of the european directives
this reminds me of a greek proverb you cannot chop off your head just because you have tooth ache
i am not suggesting that we contravene legislation
mr president there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation
i was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off european funding
i consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve
therefore i fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution
but let us be clear
we therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends
in the final analysis any breach of eu legislation must actually go the european court of justice
that is your responsibility as a member of the college
unlike the last speaker i would like to congratulate you commissioner on your threat to cut off european funding
it should not just be an idle threat
you should carry it out if member states do not act responsibly
we are per capita the worst country as regards complaints
if this affects my own country then so be it
member states have to comply with european regulations
you must stick to that
if member states are not willing to comply with the directives cut off the funding
i would support you one hundred percent
unfortunately what is happening in portugal is not unique  it is merely a good example
sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns
that is what the eu has signed up to in countless treaties from the rio earth summit onwards
that is what article  of our own ec treaty obliges us to do  to integrate those policies
at the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints
we are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this
it will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means
at a recent plenary session we talked a lot about coherence in eu policies
that is why the greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the environment committee
mr president commissioner i have listened to your address very carefully but i have not fully understood it
i will read the communication from the commission very carefully but perhaps you can help me to understand matters
that was not at all clear
let me say two or three things
firstly i think that community law must be seen as a whole
you should do that
secondly commissioner the structural funds are not given out to damage the countryside
they are given out to create jobs and to kickstart the regions
none of us want anything for the environment to be left undone
here too we must watch out
this flagrant violation of our basic environmental laws must not be allowed to continue
twelve european countries are before the european court
constitutional challenge is often quoted in ireland as one of our reasons
perhaps you will take those on board in items  and  of the motion
vaguely formulated application criteria are also the cause of the nineyear plus delay in implementation in my home region a dialogue was begun prior to identification of the ffh sites
the process brought the following problems to light in particular
in municipal areas the directive in its current form is leading to the obstruction of important infrastructure measures
without any doubt this cannot be in the interests of the commission
it would be sensible to reexamine and revise directive  to provide more certainty and clarity
citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect
ladies and gentlemen i would like to make a few final comments
this is not about the implementation of the habitats directive
remember that the directive is not an effort directive it is a result directive
that is what this is about
it is the obligation of the commission to ensure that these sites are protected
so does this mean that we will not approve the operational programmes to answer your question
we are reasonable
that is a clear timetable
if they do not do so we will launch the procedure for suspending payments without delay
that is the decision we have taken today
we have to understand that this is an opportunity for us to live up to our obligations under the regulations for the structural funds
this will be a very important tool
of course we hope that this will not be necessary because the member states will provide us with their lists
that is what we have to hope for and maybe pray for too
i have received one motion for resolution pursuant to rule  
the debate is closed
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  noon
the sitting was closed at  am
mrs maes has the floor for a point of order
maes vertsale
nl mr president parliament has been informed of some correspondence between mr prodi and mrs fontaine in her capacity as president of this parliament
mr prodi has also written a letter to mr soderman in which he criticised the way in which mr soderman thinks he should exercise his duties
mr soderman has replied to this letter and we do have this reply
we would like to know how the presidency has dealt with this correspondence
mrs maes the issue you have raised will be studied by the presidency and the conference of presidents immediately
th anniversary of the geneva convention  humanitarian law
the next item is the council statement on the th anniversary of the geneva convention  humanitarian law
in cases of this kind acts affecting more vulnerable social groups take on a particular importance and are even more shocking
it is important to carry on strengthening these organisations freedom of action and the protection of humanitarian workers
in the context of its external relations the union promotes these values and seeks to implement them at all times through its political actions
these people must start to realise that the world is no longer a place where impunity is the rule
i congratulate the president for domestic reasons
this resolution was never debated for reasons which we will not go into here
the more suffering we prevent the less action we will then have to take to repair the great damage caused by war
what more can be done therefore to increase compliance with international humanitarian law and thus limit the suffering of the victims
for example we can spread the knowledge of this law particularly throughout society itself amongst young people within mass organisations and also in the armed forces and security services
above all we must through education instil a passion for peace amongst our citizens
amongst these organisations we should highlight the international committee of the red cross
all the institutions of the european union must decisively support the work of the icrc because their role is quite simply indispensable
mr president  august  is a day which the ancient romans would have said should be marked with a red stone
we have failed to spread the lessons and values learned from that conflict
we have failed to educate against the glorification of combat in our own communities
we have failed to educate against the problems and the scourge of racism and xenophobia
we need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia
mr president i am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech
yesterday we were talking about a charter of fundamental rights today we are speaking of human rights
over the last century these have totally changed in nature
today we are hearing the case of albin kurti of kosovo
the geneva conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action
personally i cannot see any reason why the european parliament should be thanking russia
mr president a european delegation returning from chechnya a few days ago reported terrible sights
we recently witnessed a huge humanitarian disaster brought about by a supposedly humanitarian intervention
nearly  of infants born prematurely die
the children being born are underdeveloped due to malnutrition
there has been a dramatic increase in the number of abortions
mr president the symbol of the red crossred crescent movement brings hope to battlefields worldwide
article b of the relevant convention forbids the taking of hostages
millions of people are suffering worldwide
speakers today from graham watson onwards have made those points earlier
but let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering
we recall that on  august  iraq invaded kuwait in a unilateral act of aggression that was universally condemned
nine years later more than  prisoners of war are unreleased and unaccounted for by iraq
iraq is a formidable enemy
her strength and power for evil purposes is matched only by her determination not to find the missing prisoners
after nine years she has only provided information sufficient to close three files
this afternoon when we debate iraq do not forget the missing kuwaiti prisoners of war
do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain
i echo without hesitation the encouraging words which the presidentinoffice has just spoken however i need to get something off my chest
this i deeply regret
the situation in serbia is becoming more and more absurd
this was considered helping the uck
surely this is too absurd for words
meanwhile the population remains very concerned about the fate of those in prison
there are reports of torture
the milosevic regime is also stepping up the repression of serbia s own opposition
they include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights
 years after the general declaration of human rights there is still a huge gap between what we claim and what is real
respect for human rights is extremely important on both moral and political grounds
there is a vicious circle
failure to respect human rights brings the threat of both strife and economic and social decline
and if the development spiral turns downwards then human rights are dragged down with it
respect for human rights is fundamental if conflict is to be prevented and peace consolidated
trampling over human rights today paves the way for conflict tomorrow
governments held to democratic account generally take more trouble over the welfare of their people
it makes no difference if people are destroyed in the name of a race or a class
there is no political excuse for oppressing people be it from an extreme rightwing or an extreme leftwing point of view
human rights are indivisible
it must prove itself to be a community of values
but more responsible human rights policies need to start at home
i agree with mr martinez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims
however we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future
the tribunals in which those guilty of atrocities in the balkans are currently on trial send one clear message
however welcome some of these developments may be more needs to be done
they must be built upon and the establishment of the international criminal court was a significant development in the field of human rights
i also agree that the conventions are just as necessary today as they were  years ago
in my view there are at present two main problems connected with the geneva conventions
that is essentially the reverse of the situation during the first world war
the second problem is that the geneva conventions do not adequately deal with the activities of those who intervene for humanitarian reasons
this is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts
i believe we have two options which are not mutually exclusive
i therefore wholeheartedly support the demand for prompt ratification of the statute of the international criminal court
this demand has also been put forward here today
thank you very much mr nielson
i have received  motions for resolutions in accordance with rule 
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday
human rights racism xenophobia and antisemitism
the next item is the joint debate on
mr president it has now been  years since we adopted the universal declaration of human rights
after the horrors of the second world war many surely felt a strong sense of hope for a better world and a more humane future
unfortunately these hopes have in many respects been dashed
a large proportion of the world s population is still living under oppression with many deprived of their basic rights
the european community was formed in order to prevent the atrocities of the second world war from occurring again
both internal work and foreign policy rest on this principle
the european parliament has always considered the promotion of these rights to be one of its most important tasks
this work has become even more important as time has gone by
no one can fail to appreciate the commitment found for example in this house
the eu is therefore in desperate need of a coordinated strategic and consistent policy in this area
the council s report that came out in october last year was a good first step
this was a welcome report which parliament had waited many years for and which we hope to see more of
it is important but it contains several deficiencies and needs to be supplemented
we need increased coordination not just between the institutions of the eu but also between the eu and the member states
we need a consistent policy that is credible and predictable
the eu must speak with one voice and give consistent signals to the countries that violate human rights
there must be no doubt about what the eu stands for
certain basic rights are universal
violations of these can therefore never be excused on grounds of religion culture or tradition
we could also form an advisory group containing representatives from the different eu institutions
they could meet on a regular basis to discuss the promotion of human rights in the short and long term
there ought to be experts in the eu s delegations in third countries
we need an early warning system for violations of human rights
the web site could also contain links to different organisations
i would also like to say a few words about women s rights an issue that i have chosen as a special theme in the report
the commission declared  to be the year for combating violence against women
it was a praiseworthy initiative but the campaign was discreet to say the least
we need longterm work not occasional campaigns
women s rights are being systematically violated throughout the world
reports abound on violence in the home rapes ritual violence and maltreatment in prisons
during the s rape was used systematically as an act of war in many armed conflicts
this can now be a matter for examination in the international criminal court
rape is at present the world s most common crime of violence
the trade in women and children is increasing at an alarming rate
in certain countries the governments are employing a pure apartheid policy against women
thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day
the issue must be dealt with in diplomatic relations and raised with the candidate countries in the course of the negotiations relating to the enlargement of the eu
the countries of the eu must ratify the report of the proceedings of the international criminal court as soon as possible so that it can start work
the eu can play an important part when it comes to encouraging countries to ratify different international conventions for the protection of human rights
obviously we need to deal with this
if we want to be credible internally we also need to have a sound policy externally
they are universal that is to say indivisible and independent of countries and parties
they are concerned not with opinions but with actions they provide protection against injustice and discrimination
they should be clear and comprehensible and not consist of idle talk
the eu should not be changing or reinventing things
the aforesaid legal practice is not static
fortunately it is developing the whole time
the conventions too are constantly being supplemented
i think that bosnia and kosovo have taught us all that national minorities constitute the most potentially explosive factor in the europe of the future
but so too must the present member states
let us therefore urgently entreat those countries which have not ratified these conventions on national minorities to see to it that this is done straight away
now i think they should put matters in order in their own countries and get these conventions signed
the demands we impose upon others we must also impose upon ourselves
we must say to all fifteen governments go home and get the conventions signed and ratified
i could talk at length partly about the conditions to which asylum seekers are subject in our member states
i could also mention children s rights which are a huge problem including in a number of candidate states
i would also mention my proposal that we should have a supervisory body responsible for monitoring effectively the protection of personal data and the right to private life
technology is developing and so too therefore must our instruments for the protection of human rights
its starting point is the european year against racism  but the context has moved on significantly
thirdly my report notes that racial prejudice and discrimination poisons our whole society including for white people
surveys show that racism has increased and there is an increase in racist violence and support for extremist parties
on the other hand there is also progress however bumpy and some regions and cities in europe are becoming at ease with a multiracial and multicultural way of life
i would cite london which i represent as the multiracial capital of europe
some may find the language in my report blunt and it is certainly intended to be clear and unambiguous
could i just address three aspects which i understand caused some difficulty for some members of the epped group
my understanding is that there is nothing in this report that the epp has not been able to accept in the past
there are a few of the epped amendments which i can accept although it is perhaps a pity that they did not make more input at committee stage
could i appeal to members of that group to deal with their points of disagreement by making explanations of vote
i believe this report will get majority support here in plenary
i hope very much that the report will get a large majority when it is voted on later
mr president racism xenophobia and antisemitism are completely incompatible with the european union s political principles
please allow me to make a direct reference these evil and harmful human phenomena are also completely at odds with the bible
meanwhile the daytoday reality is disappointing
racism xenophobia and antisemitism are realities in eastern and western europe alike
however this situation should not lead to debilitating mutual recriminations or imputations
quite the opposite in fact a common social threat requires a common political effort
this kind of attention also requires us to look into our own hearts
mrs ludford s report bears witness to this
indeed the european union s moral standards for newcomers apply just as much to the member states themselves
with regard to manifestations of racism xenophobia and antisemitism the member states are by no means holier than thou
this is the roma issue with all its intricacies in a nutshell
how can they be galvanised into social involvement and into achieving the muchneeded change in mentality
fortunately such profound questions are heard  officially and unofficially  within the candidate member states
they have led to well thoughtthrough and promising initiatives and projects at national level but these absorb a huge amount of funding
in a nutshell the eu s future member states are making a direct appeal for solidarity to the current eu members
the latter injustice should certainly not be missed out from the trio of racism xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate member states
indeed antisemitism does not appear to bear any relevance to the numerical presence of jews
for example demagogues will take pleasure in pointing out the jewish background  founded or not as the case may be  of their hated political rivals
in this light jews and hungarians are seen as traitors of the mother country in romania
paragraph  of the draft resolution should be read against this dark background
the amendments have been carefully weighed up within the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy and quite a few have been honoured
mainly to avoid duplication i will only partly support the newly tabled amendments
all in all the present report requires in my opinion regular followups or continuous reassessment
it would mean a great deal to me if this were to be accomplished
it is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of europe which we are disturbed about
in slovakia the czech republic and hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the roma
i would make two or three other very simple points
there are many questions we must discuss how strongly will we push the question of article 
do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the european union
the answer is yes
we must have it quickly and we must have comprehensive legislation
that situation is improving but ultimately we have institutions which are bereft of representation
it is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle
racism is a complex issue
we have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go
mr president i would like to congratulate mrs malmstrom on her very balanced and illuminating report
i also back the rapporteur s decision to deal extensively with the women s rights issue
with the sharia on the up in various parts of the world this issue is more topical than ever
the example of afghanistan illustrates that discrimination against women is not a cultural but a political phenomenon
moreover afghanistan is not the only country where the rights of women are violated on a massive scale
millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off
in many african countries women are not allowed to own any possessions or open a bank account without the permission of a man
other practices such as polygamy or the inheriting of widows have become untenable in an aids era
it is hardly surprising that in africa more women than men are infected with the aids virus
we must condemn all practices which lead to the mutilation or death of women
within the european union female circumcision must be made a punishable offence
this is not a matter of tradition or culture it is one of the basic human rights
but the atrocities in the rest of the world should not blind us to the atrocities in our own countries
domestic violence is still a huge problem within the european union
we must take a firm stance against this which also involves prosecution
a business which is estimated by the undp to be worth usd  billion
a powerful and concerted effort is needed from all member states to fight this outrageous form of trafficking in human beings
mr president this report sends a powerful message to the council and commission
i urge both institutions to turn it into something tangible something concrete and to do something constructive with it
in any case we will judge them on their actions not their words
one example of this is mrs malmstrom s suggestion of a special representative to protect those fighting for human rights
it is also the duty of parliament to examine the question of human rights in the candidate countries in a systematic way
i am also very pleased that mr haarder took up the rights of minority groups
the commission needs this aid
we ought also to give aid when it comes to allocating budget funds to work for children s rights
i also believe that in this area we need to guard against children s becoming a commodity
without civil society we are living in a vacuum
we cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside from grassroots level
the report contains a number of excellent and wellconsidered proposals
this is a precision weapon which must be utilised more
it must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels
we cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment
the finnish writer samuli paronen wrote big crimes need many accomplices millions  all those who do nothing 
mr president ladies and gentlemen i think these reports speak for themselves
racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the european union and beyond
our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it
due to its clearsightedness mrs ludford s report actively contributes to this approach
it is a crime against human dignity it is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals
on each occasion people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks
there is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation
this can be seen in the discrimination applied in access to housing leisure facilities and employment
the name on one was foreignsounding and the other was typically french
you can guess which applicant was invited for interview
throughout its history europe has been capable of the best and the worst
we must teach our children about all of this
these people have clearly chosen their side
all these fine words must now lead to concrete action and practical legislative steps
legislation against racism must be harmonised the words must take on real meaning
this is how we can positively support the values for which we are fighting
for example the right to immigration does not exist
moreover the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable if only for reasons of space and numbers
and in addition there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights
for example we have been talking about the roma
many of them abuse their women and more importantly their children
illtreated ragged children are often to be seen on the streets and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passersby and to induce them to give them some money
we must take care that we do not become a minority ourselves and that we do not become victims of discrimination here in our own home
asylum policy has been dealt with extensively so has the heading life styles and types of relationships 
the rights of homosexuals have been given more attention than is necessary and all kinds of requirements have been imposed on the member states
and where does the right to life come in
and what about the protection of the family
racism xenophobia and antisemitism must be stamped out
i fully share this view which is expressed in the ludford report
this notion smacks of a naive kind of intellectualism
the netherlands has adopted such a policy over the past couple of years aimed at bringing about a multicultural society
this did not turn out to be a success as is evident from the multicultural drama which we now find ourselves in
finally racism xenophobia and antisemitism have i am sorry to say existed throughout the world since time immemorial
with this in mind we should take the centuryold biblical commandment love thy neighbour like thyself to heart
in so doing he has confirmed my contention that this action by the  lacks any justifiable basis mr schulz
i should therefore like to point out that the ratification of the charter for minority languages referred to is indeed an element of the government s programme
applause from the right
we have several basic principles
our third principle is in line with the unchanging beliefs of the ppede group
children are actually invisible in the eu treaties
animals have rights children do not
yet children are affected by the laws that the eu passes and the single market
the electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters the paedophiles and the pornographers than to industrialists
we have problems in the candidate countries
we have a scandal at the moment in latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government
we have pictures on our tv almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world
and of course we have familiar tales of child labour
we have to take tougher action
we have to bring children up the agenda
we should ensure that measures developed by the commission have a specific children s dimension
we should ensure that there is somebody in the commission with responsibility for child matters
why can we not do the same
we also have in great britain a children s select committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses
why can we not do the same
can we make sure that the charter of fundamental rights has a section relating to children
i know we have communications
mr president why are human rights so far behind human progress
science technology and communication have broadened man s knowledge and expertise and abilities beyond belief
we should therefore concentrate all our efforts on these human rights
but cultural value patterns underlie these violations too
mrs malmstrom was therefore right in asking in her special report that the position of the woman be given special attention
in a great many societies the woman is still suffering at the hands of men as a result of institutionalised and sometimes legalised misuse of power
not collective habits but the effects on the individual must be the overriding factor in our judgement
european foreign policy is too easily thrown off course by purely economic interests
it is high time that human rights were given the priority they deserve not only in theory but also in practice
in this way europe can make a substantial contribution to progress progress of civilisation
yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people
i can give you two examples of this
the union has confirmed its attachment to the geneva and dublin conventions by establishing the antideportation principle
another flagrant attack on human rights concerns foreigners and citizenship
this really is a case of fundamental rights
how can we allow some people to be excluded
how can they believe in the reality of the declaration of human rights
mr president this debate is taking place at an important moment for this parliament
this year is especially significant
we have seen the mayor of that city receive  support in the elections there
to this end we in the european union could develop a more constructive attitude
i therefore propose five points which are the contributions of the guengl group to the various reports
i want to make three small points
the second point is an extension of yesterday s debate
it is said that the more rights we have the better but rights are part and parcel of a complicated interplay of systems
the result of an eu charter would be an endlessly complicated morass of legal and constitutional problems
which is the decisionmaking authority
are the rights guaranteed under the convention on human rights better than those guaranteed under the eu s charter
is the latter again better than the national constitutions
that is a question which has no meaning
finally my third remark is a compliment to the rapporteur mr haarder
it is with satisfaction and much interest that i see that paragraph  emphasises the collective right to trade union membership
i want to congratulate mr haarder on the new political insight on his part which is evidenced here
a few weeks ago taxi drivers in brussels were refusing to take austrian passengers
austrians were thrown out of hotels and restaurants in belgium and france
austrians working abroad had their cars vandalised stones thrown at their houses and their children were threatened at school
today it was revealed that the austrian entrant in a show jumping competition in grenoble had his invitation withdrawn
perhaps we shall soon see mozart banned from international opera houses
who knows where it will all end
however i would stress that these remarks are out of place in a report on human rights
i would like to say something else on the subject of this report regarding the right of europeans to their own identity
i am a practising christian who is sure of his beliefs now is this a reason to accuse me of xenophobia
on the contrary xenophobia is more likely to be caused by a decline in religious convictions
religion per se is a factor which promotes fraternity
i am a staunch italian patriot so according to paragraph o of this document i could be accused of xenophobia
a multicultural europe which does not include european culture would lead to disaster and its decline
this is not a not a question of black or white cultures there is no connection between colour and culture
culture is based on values not colour
there are many issues related to xenophobia and racism but these must be dealt with by the local communities
lastly are we really of the opinion that all those who are not in favour of completely uncontrolled immigration are racist
it seems to me to be a very comprehensive report and to make some very striking points
i would like to draw the house s attention to three key points concerning human rights as i see this issue at present
at this event water will be treated as a rare economic commodity
the situation is becoming ever more critical but the right to water also has to be seen as a human right
the second point that i would like to mention today very briefly is the situation in angola
the report says that attacks on human rights in angola have been treated with too much diplomatic discretion
i refer mr president to point  and points  and  of the haarder report
we have to admit however that we still have a lot of homework to do
selfcriticism is not enough
it does us credit but alone it does not suffice
the same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many member states
in this sense thank you
to be effective the fight against discrimination requires broader and in particular more specific measures
therefore any restriction linked to nationality for access to civil service jobs must be abolished
the institutions of the community and member states must lead the way in this
in the same way full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the european union the right to vote in all elections
as long as these third country nationals are refused political rights they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination
if their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right why limit this to the local and european levels
this would mean breaking with the provisions of the schengen amsterdam and dublin treaties which are real insults to the right of asylum
they gather dust on the shelves of the commission and in the offices of wellmeaning people and governments
we must show leadership as must the media educational institutions and the churches they have not shown such leadership in the past
shame on us for ignoring mozambique for so long and doing too little too late
it is a real shame on us and the other european institutions that we cannot respond to these kinds of disasters
shame on us for allowing the children of iraq to die at the rate of   a month
half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions
there continues to be a barbarous war in iraq
bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported
it is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country
we should intervene with the security council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people
shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the great lakes region
shame on us in the european union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the eu in general
it is something we have a great responsibility to do something about
we are not doing anything whatsoever about it
the citizens of this union are our judges and juries
unless we show them leadership and a sense of purpose a sense of direction they will make their judgements in the coming years
we will have failed them unless we tackle racism and xenophobia in the european union
i want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in ireland
the report is based on the notion of the unity of the human species a christian teaching which forms a firm barrier against any lapses of a racist nature
man could be seen as being created in the image of god
an ideology of this kind which overestimates the sense of community contains insufficient guarantees against tendencies towards discrimination
i condemn such a conservative ideology
it is only logical that we should observe these values
this does not always accord with their and our gut reactions but that is  like it or not  the trademark of sound principles
they do not always turn out to be to our advantage
people have to overcome their fears and shortterm interests
we need to help the candidate member states in a critical yet constructive way and not be afraid to call a spade a spade
the belder report contains a few concrete pointers in this respect
my group did not have any reason to table any more amendments
i have subscribed to this practice in the netherlands for some  years starting with the south moluccans
i have no problem at all with providing them with government jobs
governments do well to give ethnic minorities a visible presence in police forces for example
in my opinion it is extremely impractical to restrict the options in this respect and i certainly do not want to see this become a requirement
what interest would be served in doing so
mr president i have two brief comments to make to the previous speaker my esteemed colleague mr oostlander
as far as the debate on the ludford and haarder reports is concerned allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my group
mr haarder submitted an excellent draft report to the committee and the committee tabled  proposed amendments and  compromise amendments making a total of  amendments
these ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee
they never take part in detailed discussions of the problems
why then do we always have these proposed amendments in plenary
the answer is in their speeches which we have already had the pleasure of here today
they want to use this forum to bring their platitudes to the attention of as wide an audience as possible throughout the world
technical work no thank you
simplified rabblerousing yes please
that is the political strategy of the extreme right in this house
this is important because only those who are critical of themselves have the right to criticise others
the annual debate on these matters paves the way for the basic political orientation of the european union
i just wonder what that has to do with human rights
applause
human rights must be integrated into all political cooperation that the eu is involved in
mr president although we are moving in the right direction not everything in the garden is rosy
for example some states do not respect the basic right to education and the use of one s own language
chirac speaks of the rights of the inuits in quebec but ignores linguistic rights in france
this approach to politics based on pure hypocrisy is entirely unacceptable to us
finally for the basque citizens whom i represent there can be no excuses based on internal affairs or on political opportunism
for us there are simply here and elsewhere people citizens with unalienable rights on which we wish to base our coexistence
it is intolerable that the european parliament should ask us to breach the provisions of this constitution which is one of the most democratic and advanced constitutions in the world
moreover the house of savoy has never acknowledged the sovereignty of the republic or the irrevocable nature of the decision to create a republic which is enshrined in the constitution
we have no hesitation in reiterating that there is no room in my country for the descendants of the former kings of italy
i have identified three particularly characteristic points
finally it is suggested that we give homosexual couples the same rights as families
this talk is intellectually invalid because the terms used are not even defined
what are racism xenophobia nationalism and extremism
what do these concepts cover
what are their philosophical origins
what doctrines do they involve
do those accused of these acts deserve this opprobrium
this is completely absurd
racism is the desire to achieve the domination of one race over another
who is racist in europe nowadays
xenophobia is the rejection of a foreign presence
as for antisemitism which is apparently reemerging in europe why not ask the real questions
yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants 
the religion of antiracism has its dogmas its priests its inquisitors and its witchhunts
history will roundly condemn the protagonists of this shameful ideology which we are proud to fight at any time
the english philosopher john locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom

the plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane
neither represent any conceivable threat to the italian state
there is much talk of a charter of fundamental rights
such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this parliament does not first do all it can to address existing treaty violations
the rights under the treaty are not conditional in my view
the treaty does not discriminate against individual families and the treaty is therefore violated
i therefore commend paragraphs  and  to this house
mr president respect for human rights is one of the european union s cornerstones
that is what it says in the treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of
the commotion is justified given the nature of the topic but the confusion is not
fortunately we can show our disagreement by drumming our fingers on our tables
as far as the content of the report is concerned i would like to outline a few topics
to ask the question is to answer it
it is wise to remain vigilant when it comes to observing human rights of the extensive minorities in europe
people from these groups more often than not economically vulnerable run the considerable risk of becoming victims of discrimination
the reality is that millions of people live in poverty in our rich and privileged europe
as is evident from the amendments the battle is not over yet not by a long shot
my group on the other hand considers the principle of equality sacrosanct
after all human rights are there for everybody
mr president i should like to express my thanks for the broad support given to the main features of this report
i should like to tell her that i am also delighted to vote for the further amendments which she has tabled and which we shall be voting on tomorrow
i should also however like to thank mr pirker and mrs palacio
i should like to express my gratitude for the broad agreement we have obtained in connection with this report
there are ten words missing from the danish version
if he reads the english version he will be able to see what the wording should be
mr president in the present report china has been subjected to criticism
in actual fact of course we do need to discuss human rights with china
then the chinese will have to discuss and not just protest
its attitude towards the turkish regime is a blatant example
political and social rights are being hit and individual rights and democratic freedoms are being trampled underfoot
the results of this policy are already visible in the support being given to extremist racist fascist powers and not just in austria
and yet the report on the fight against racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been drawn
mr president i congratulate mr haarder whose excellent work i would describe as wellbalanced measured and well thought out
i hope that he receives the broad support of this house that he has asked for
he deserves it
i will give just one example
just one more example last sunday the basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote
mr president i want to speak for a few moments on the ludford report on countering racism in the european union
that is certainly what we on this side of the house believe
that is what this report aims to do
but the epp it seems and others opposite clearly do not want that
we heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from mr gollnisch on behalf of his party
mrs palacio who is just leaving has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core
the epp s amendments seek to divide families
they object to family unity
their amendment no  seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in europe
the epp it seems do not accept that ethnic minorities feel alienated from the electoral process
that is the aim of amendment no  it deletes that from the report
they are against ethnic diversity and they do not accept the benefits given to our society by all its people
they do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process
we cannot complain about what is going on in the candidate states if we have amendments like this being put forward in the european union
nor it seems does the epp believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote
their amendment no  deletes the call for encouragement to the ethnic minority to take part in elections to vote or stand as candidates
is that what we want
i do not think it is
we on this side of the house reject that position completely
we will publicise the epp position and their amendments whether they are passed or not
we deplore the line that mr hernandez mollar and his colleague have put forward
should the epp amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report
the epp amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this parliament worse than at the moment
it would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support
it would be a retrograde step
mr president i thank all those who have spoken on my report i should just like to clear up a few misunderstandings
firstly nowhere does this report say that fighting racism means you should have no immigration controls
the references to enhanced rights for third country nationals means of course rights for those who are legally resident
secondly on religion and identity there is an assertion that there is no exclusivity
i agree with mr schulz
christianity has been an important contributor to european values but it does not hold a monopoly on them
thirdly reference has been made to quotas
nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned
as a liberal i am opposed to quotas
this report is the annual debate on racism in the year 
it refers to where we are now
i welcome the remarks of mr oostlander and i welcome his support for the report
as a gesture of goodwill i will be accepting five small amendments from the epp though incidentally none of those mentioned by mr evans
i very much hope that more members of the epped group will support this report
people within their own communities therefore suffer
a heartfelt thank you to the rapporteurs for their work
more and more we need to follow our words with actions
even in this parliament fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed
we must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other
europe is full of haiders
and this does not mean that i do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many roma and other immigrants
i would like to be able to share with everyone my conviction that in our countries no one is a stranger
this is already happening
this express reference creates the erroneous impression that this is not the case
what we need is a common european asylum and immigration policy based on european humanitarian values
the reference in question therefore in mr haarder s otherwise excellent report is therefore irrelevant today
the abolition of the death penalty worldwide is the very least that we should be calling for if we really want to defend human rights
the condemned sometimes await their execution for many years in american prisons
as it is now time for the votes we shall suspend the joint debate and it shall resume at  pm
vote
this concerns amendments nos   and  in particular
thank you mr lannoye this is totally clear
after the vote
this would mean that the directive could be adopted by a qualified majority and we would then be able to lay the directive to rest
belgians and french people would then be able to enjoy british chocolate as much as the british have enjoyed french and belgian chocolate
the president declared the common position approved as amended
the president declared the common position approved as amended
the president declared the common position approved as amended
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
madam president i would like to point out a mistake in translation in amendments nos  and 
quite right mrs myller i am informed that the translation department is already aware of these errors
we can therefore point these out at the appropriate moment
before the vote on amendment no 
in both amendment no  and no  it should read critical loads should not be exceeded 
in place of the word exceeded it says reached  which is the opposite
thank you everyone is now clear on this
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
joint motion for a resolution on the special european council to be held in lisbon on  march 
parliament adopted the resolution
i would be most grateful if we do that right now
i feel that we should not spend any more time on this
i will therefore put this to the house
we also consider that the application of directives is the responsibility of the law the commission and the court of justice
we do not therefore wish to take part in this vote which we regard as partisan
we do not in fact yet know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as i was going to put this to the house
ladies and gentlemen we must think about this carefully
i said that we would end at  pm and we have respected this timetable
we should keep to what was decided
madam president i disagree with this decision
the president put the proposal to the house which decided to end voting time
madam president i did not want to interrupt the voting when i arrived a little bit late
could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier
absolutely mrs banotti
we will make a note of this
explanations of vote
recommendation for second reading of the lannoye report a
however these amendments were not adopted unfortunately
as a consequence we remain concerned about the thirdworld cocoa producers
it is regrettable that the study into the impact of the new directive for the countries in the south was not carried out earlier
from now on chocolate is no longer a product which consists of nothing but cocoa butter
in some parts of the union the name chocolate was already used even if the product contained substitute products
the president cut the speaker off
the european parliament is clearly not in tune with public opinion in several respects
firstly its position does not correspond to the demands of consumers who want clear labelling
we have not granted them this labelling on chocolate
parliament is also not in tune with public opinion which is becoming increasingly reticent about gmos
we have rightly refused to allow gmos in chocolate but only by three votes
the question to be asked is who really benefits from the manipulation and 
the president cut the speaker off
mr president i taste sweet victory for british chocolate producers in our vote today in their fight to have good british chocolate recognised across europe as the delicious highquality product that it is
developing countries are also the victors
this legislation takes account of the needs of the world s poorest farmers
so chocoholics can now munch safe in the knowledge they are doing their bit for the third world
i am sure you will agree that the eu in the past has got itself into a right twix on this matter
some governments have got their snickers in a twist trying to protect their chocolate industries
for them however crunchie time has come and they now have creme egg on their faces
it is high time the european parliament gave two cadbury s fingers to the chocolate snobs
 it is now sixteen years since the debate on chocolate started in the european parliament
i believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive
debates about national tastes and products give us too far wide a sphere for ridiculous discussions
consumer choice will be exercised regardless of what the eu does and that is only fair
national chauvinism has been all too often evident in the chocolate debate
this proposal in no way responds to the concerns expressed by meps during the vote at first reading on  october 
in reality this proposed directive mainly reflects the position of the chocolate multinationals and defends only their interests with any certainty
i am therefore not happy about this
firstly i must congratulate the rapporteur on his tenacity in this chocolate issue
next i will sketch the broad outlines of this issue
the eight other member states  germany belgium spain france greece italy luxembourg and the netherlands  ban vegetable fats
this has clearly succeeded in causing some occasionally stormy debates and has particularly revived legitimate concerns among consumers
a campaign has subsequently developed to promote food quality at the same time as food diversity
the replacement of cocoa butter with other vegetable fats raises a question about protecting the very nature of chocolate
adequate guarantees must therefore be provided for both consumers and cocoa producers
we must demand the following
however i still believe that this is an essential condition to ensure respect for the  rule
very explicit wording intended for consumers so that they can buy chocolate in full knowledge of the facts
the reservation of the name quality chocolate for products which contain cocoa butter
a study into the impact of such a measure on the export of cocoa by developing countries
i support these demands which are contained in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur
i myself am a consumer who is concerned about the quality and taste of traditional chocolate
this is all cockeyed
of course we should inform consumers that the products they are buying are adulterated
yet this is nonsensical when this information is written in small letters in an incomprehensible language on the back of the packaging
please stop messing about with our gastronomic traditions our quality products and our soil
stop playing with our food
now that would be real progress
who would have believed it
in terms of chocolate as in other areas different cultures and traditions exist
everyone has different tastes
this is for reasons connected with safeguarding the legitimate interests of cocoaproducing countries and also reasons relating to consumer protection
it is quite clear that a step of this kind would inevitably have an adverse effect on cocoaproducing countries
this directive alters the very definition of chocolate which should in our opinion be made from cocoa butter and beans
consumers require clear and specific information
they should no longer be deceived
today s vote went beyond the problem of chocolate alone and has threatened the confidence of our fellow citizens
 da the basis for prosperity in the eu is competition
and the intention in adopting a new directive on chocolate products is precisely to improve competition in the eu
with regard to food policy and consumer protection we must be very careful
but this is not a question of health or environmental protection
seen from the consumers point of view it is exclusively a question of taste
it cannot therefore be right for politicians to decide what consumers should be entitled to choose between
products should be put on sale and it should be clear what they contain but otherwise we must rely upon consumers own judgement
we can hardly do otherwise
consumers should find out for themselves what tastes best
this  of vegetable fats which of course cannot be verified will be of greatest benefit to the chocolate industry which will soon flood the market with cheap imitation chocolate thereby causing an increase in the price of real chocolate which will become a luxury product for privileged consumers
the people of europe do not want this to be a place with standardised consumers living in a large uniform internal market
they expect major political ambition from europe not punctilious regulations of secondary importance
the misadventures of the new chocolate directive primarily illustrate the extraordinary weight and slowness of the community s legislative process
has such a long process at least resulted in a practical text
the answer is clearly no
the new directive does not meet any of the relevant needs
the  directive clearly and unambiguously defined chocolate as a product made with sugar and cocoa
to take account of the food customs of certain northern countries derogations were specified
the situation was therefore satisfactory
so why change it
why under the pretext of simplification  has it actually been attempted to subvert the  directive
might the rest of the acquis communautaire no longer be untouchable
cocoa butter represents  to  of the total price of chocolate
will this at least increase the level of requirements and quality for all member states
not at all
in fact quite the contrary
as usual harmonisation is occurring at the lowest common denominator
it is the lowest quality level which will be generalised in order to ultimately impose a standardised eurotaste to the detriment of taste quality
will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate
the commission is therefore setting a percentage which it knows is unverifiable
this is deceitful
the text also contains dishonest provisions in terms of labelling
as this amendment was not retained by the council the consumer will not be correctly informed
chocolate lovers religiously savour your next easter eggs
what will be next after chocolate
when labelling comes in the door sense flies out the window
this is a distinctive label used throughout europe which we want to imbue with renewed vigour
it is based on the principle of a global approach which takes account of the whole life cycle of the product
however we must not cast aside all the national logos
consumers and buyers have their own codes and have built up their confidence on the logos which they know
you could almost imagine yourself faced with a bar of chocolate
 madam president i wholeheartedly support europe s moves to become an ecofriendly continent
this measure is yet further proof of the eu s commitment to greening up its act
since  the euroflower logo has become a hallmark of environmentallyfriendly products ranging from washing machines to writing paper
however consumers enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry
the measures contained in this year strategy however should hopefully bring manufacturers on board
in the fight to clean up our planet britain s labour government has of course been at the forefront
at kyoto for example deputy prime minister john prescott secured against the odds an agreement to cut global emissions
britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by  by 
not content with that the government has recently raised the target to  by 
this house should challenge other member states to match britain s example
of course protecting the planet means much more than just cleaning up the atmosphere
it means protecting the natural environment on the ground too
again britain s labour government is leading the way
its recent wildlife bill for example will give greater protection to endangered species than ever before
our citizens want to see concrete action
they do not want to see mere hot air from politicians which just adds to global warming
by harnessing euroflower power we can all contribute to a cleaner greener world
recommendation for second reading of the blokland report a
 blokland rightly raises serious concerns regarding waste disposal including incineration
commitment by the irish government to serious recycling and separation of waste is far from evident
waste management is a very complex issue subject to extensive lobbying
this is why the european union has adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle this major environmental and health challenge
the directive before us today is part of this strategy as it aims to regulate the thermal treatment of hazardous or nonhazardous waste
i therefore raised my concerns and questions at first reading
regrettably in my opinion a majority has approved coincineration
everyone knows that the volume of waste to be incinerated in the european union is set to increase
thirtyone million tonnes of municipal waste were incinerated in  and this figure will be in excess of  million this year
the pollutants emitted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste
this is why our concerns focus on the emissions of heavy metals dioxins and furanes
the debate has particularly crystallised around coincineration plants
these use hazardous waste as fuel for the production of energy or physical elements
although the provisions of the applicable directives impose a maximum limit of  of hazardous waste in the fuel used this percentage is too high
these plants must be subject to very strict control standards at least as strict as those imposed on incinerators
 the european union has been at the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years
this directive also seeks to control the discharge of waste into our water systems
this report is now before us at second reading
i believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal
 billion tonnes of waste are being generated within the eu each year
there is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general
nothing less than a major shift from reliance on landfill sites to more integrated waste management plans will suffice
these targets which are to be achieved over the next fifteen years include the following
 a diversion of  of overall household waste from landfill sites
 a minimum  reduction in biodegradable waste presently consigned for landfill sites
all these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management
the day of landfill sites is now coming to an end and they must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies
there is unanimous support for this position across all the fifteen member states of the european union

in view of this waste management according to the law of the least immediate cost is not acceptable
the member states and their industries must therefore be urged to quickly take the steps necessary to adapt
on environmental matters it is by doing what is immediately possible that we will have a chance of achieving what is desirable in the long term
 establishes stricter limit values for emissions in particular those of carbon oxides and particulates
 will put incineration and coincineration plants on the same footing in terms of limit values removing the special status granted to coincineration plants
 increases the relevant authorities powers of intervention in case of noncompliance with limit values at installations
 drastically reduces the scope for using the end waste from incineration and coincineration particularly in civil engineering projects
 makes continuous sampling of dioxins a compulsory requirement in incineration and coincineration processes
 increases the role of the public in decision making on the siting of installations
 makes it compulsory to publish an annual environmental report on compliance with limit values
 considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns
i now believe that the common position submitted by the council is a very good compromise which i can support
however i must make one specific point about coincineration in cement works and justify my vote against two amendments
the majority of the member states currently have limit values of  mgm
in a recent costbenefit analysis the commission concluded that values of  mgm are the best compromise
to impose limit values of  mgm would involve an excessive environmental cost and would not be profitable
 sv more stringent rules for incineration plants are highly desirable
plants for unsorted waste require more advanced equipment
it is in no one s interests to cut meps off from their grassroots
however we cannot support the proposal as it also aims to subject all plants to the same emission standards
this is not the way to deal with the overcapacity of incinerators in europe and the rapporteur agrees with this
certain waste flows are more easily treated in a coincineration plant
with regard to municipal waste i have several comments to make
see in this respect annex va
however thinking on this issue must be taken into account and research must be continued
the waste treatment industry will have to be very inventive in the future to avoid actually causing pollution
the aim of these proposals is to improve air quality and protect human health
incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal
sometimes however it can release dangerous chemicals such as dioxins into the atmosphere
it is therefore vital that these byproducts are monitored and prevented from escaping into the environment
the technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists
we just need to make sure that it is used
the sensible measures put forward by the commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology
i find the ukip s hypocrisy breathtaking
while pretending to be the eurocrat s foe they are clearly in fact the eurocrat s friend
i fear that cleaning up the environment may prove to be a doddle compared to the task of persuading the ukip to clean up its act
the losers sadly will be our own citizens
at the time the majority of the waste was biodegradable which is far from being the case today
we have just been talking about chocolate
we are facing an enormous challenge in terms of waste management
however i believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically
onethird of domestic and similar waste treated by french disposal plants is currently handled by three hundred incinerators
this incineration generates polluting emissions of dust metals and dioxins which must be controlled using a smoke treatment system
the regulations on the limitation of discharges are gradually being reinforced
my colleagues should also note another point although this is of less importance
in my opinion however an information campaign is needed following the merger of these directives
the sorting of waste which they carry out therefore appears to be useless
we must therefore set up a proper information and explanatory campaign
davies report a
in the long term this can even cause premature ageing of lungs
these facts are frightening to say the least which is why i warmly welcome this proposed directive
it sets longterm objectives and interim target values for ozone in ambient air
it also introduces a framework of standards to protect human health and the environment
finally it requires member states to monitor ozone concentrations and to report the results to the public
the directive will therefore provide a benchmark for the levels of ozone in ambient air
however the commission s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved
this is to be regretted
as a first interim step target values are set
the aim is to achieve these as far as possible by 
these currently call for an  reduction in a range of greenhouse gases
myller report a
we are today debating a legislative proposal which affects us all directly as it aims to improve ambient air quality
it is part of the community s fifth environmental action programme or eap
the ceilings indicated in this text must be complied with by  at the latest
the programmes are to be updated and revised by 
these inventories and projections must be reported to the commission each year
the rapporteur has proposed amendments to reinforce this proposal
in particular she suggests setting stricter standards for emissions of the four pollutants in question
in principle i can only agree with these proposals
however setting the standards too high can be counterproductive
the report also asks the commission to propose new amendments to the directive by 
these amendments could ensure that the directive is brought into line with technical and scientific developments and would allow the objectives to potentially be achieved by 
i feel this is a good compromise
the rapporteur also proposes setting target dates for achieving these objectives this is essential
without compulsory deadlines texts are all too often simply declarations of intent which achieve nothing
in the same respect penalties applicable to infringements of the directive s provisions must be established as quickly as possible
motion for a resolution on the lisbon european council
despite current growth job creation in europe is notoriously inadequate
those jobs which are created tend to be precarious particularly where they involve women and young people
we must move away from simple declarations of intent no matter how positive they may be
in view of the extremely high social expectations we must urgently define measurable and verifiable objectives
the introduction of a process for reducing working time without any loss of wages or flexibility
for all these reasons we will vote against the joint motion
this initiative is to be congratulated
the preparation of a coherent and coordinated strategy involving all the member states is therefore essential
we must firstly set ambitious objectives
the presidency s document also stresses the necessary reinforcement of social convergence and the modernisation of our social protection systems
the essential condition is clearly to guarantee a high level of employment
this requires the creation of jobs not just any jobs but quality jobs particularly in the service sector
it also involves keeping jobs in europe given that the recent trend has been mass and systematic redundancies
this means that the workforce has to adapt to the new information technologies
i therefore broadly support this programme
you will find them fighting for a social democratic mutually supportive europe a workers europe a europe of the people and you will find us by their side fighting with them
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
human rights racism xenophobia and antisemitism continuation
madam president i should like to expressly thank mr belder for his report
racism xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem including within the european union
fighting them is one of the common goals of almost every political group in this house
this house is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas but not on this question
and rightly so
mr belder knows that i and the committee wished to quote the specifics of individual problems in candidate countries
a number of proposed amendments by baroness ludford attempt to rectify this and i shall support them
there is almost a total lack of analytical appraisal or special programmes to combat it
and as far as the commission programmes in the candidate countries are concerned commissioner the word almost can be dispensed with
i consider this an unacceptable oversight and i therefore refer this question to you specifically
antisemitism is without doubt widespread often it is latent which complicates the issue
this debate should therefore be a separate and very very specific task for us and the commission
in particular i welcome the information it contains regarding the euchina human rights dialogue
too often in the past eu member states have allowed themselves to be blackmailed by china
capitulating to china was both immoral and cowardly
it was cowardly also
history has consistently shown that the correct approach is to stand up to a bully
attempts to compromise are always interpreted as weakness by bullies and china is such a bully
we see this in its response to legitimate international concerns about its human rights record
it treats the views of the outside world with contempt
we witnessed it again at last week s conference of the national people s congress in beijing
its warmongering tone in relation to taiwan is unacceptable and is a direct interference in taiwan s presidential election
its arrogance in relation to its treatment of falun gong practitioners and dissidents also cannot be tolerated
the most basic violation of human rights is the denial of each individual s right to live decently
the aim is to create acceptable living conditions for all
everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion
everyone is entitled to education culture and health
everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably
we must declare that poverty will not be tolerated
could the idea of fraternity become the key concept for the st century
fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest
our century will be a century of progress in which the wildest utopian ideals may be realised
fraternity is one of these ideals and together ladies and gentlemen we can achieve it
i would like to compliment the president on the wise decision to take these four reports together
and we still have a long way to go as regards violence by the police and in prisons and in combating racism and xenophobia
and it is precisely on these points that this report is a dishonest and sorry effort and i make no bones about the fact
that is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report
we are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make
there should be a broad consensus on this in this house
i believe it has a place here
what was happening  years ago in austria was that mr haider was actually persecuting the slovenespeaking minority there
very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time
we need to tell the estonians and the latvians that if they continue that treatment their prospects of joining the european union will be that much less
allow me to tell you which points we do not accept and why
they are the points which fall outside the stated report period of 
secondly we are against all the points which fly in the face of the basic principle of solidarity
mr nassauer has already pointed out the fact that intervention in the right to hold public office has been called for here
has the author ever tried to enter public office in morocco for example
the question of recruitment to public office in a member state or to the police is exclusively a matter for that member state
i consider this last point to be very important
the report does not contain what the title promises
madam president thanks are due to mr haarder for a basically splendid piece of work
there is nonetheless one point on which i have to say that i disagree with the rapporteur
i will therefore present mr hernandez mollar s intervention
madam president the debate on xenophobia and racism is always of great importance politically and socially
european citizenship is an abstract concept which lacks any legal form
that was mr hernandez mollar s intervention
i will now begin my own madam president
however that firm and unequivocal will must be exercised in a manner which is legally rigorous and above all based on common sense
this must be done whilst respecting their specific religious beliefs and cultural characteristics
the tiniest hint of racism intolerance or xenophobia must be eradicated in any member state in which it may occur
however the administrative status of the resident is not the same as the political status of the citizen
however full political citizenship must be acquired in accordance with the laws of each member state
many of the tragedies of the twentieth century in europe have resulted from ignoring this wise advice
let us allow renan to refresh our memories but let us not indulge in excesses which are less than rational and of dubious morality
the report raises many relevant points
many indeed such as the issue of racism and discrimination in the candidate countries require a great deal of attention
however in my contribution i would like to home in on the predicament of the roma people otherwise known as gypsies
many roma in the candidate member states live in extremely abject conditions
they are frequently at the receiving end of all kinds of discrimination
under the communist regime they were subjected to an assimilation policy after this after  they were more or less left to fend for themselves
in the light of enlargement the commission has now also accorded their problem priority status and rightly so
we want the european union to get more directly involved in order to address the problems of the roma
not only the european commission but also this parliament would do well to pay a lot more attention to this
this should first and foremost be placed within a broader context
regional developments and a sound social policy are indispensable tools in this
roma often live in areas where everyone is struggling
we want to adopt an approach from a local perspective
local communities and local governments play a key role in solving the problems of the roma
at the same time local cooperation is an effective tool against prejudice and discrimination
the roma s own contribution is also important
as far as i am concerned this too is a key word
roma need to be able to stand up for themselves more
they need to become directly involved and given coresponsibility in order to improve their conditions
in my opinion official recognition of the roma as a minority could help them to achieve more political independence
in addition there is a need for more specific action aimed at changing people s mentality
the tendency to discriminate is often deeprooted even at government level
this needs to be given special attention
i also advocate sound cooperation between the european union and the council of europe
we should make better use of the expertise developed within these circles
finally i would like to underline that more than anything there is a great need for tangible results in the short term
many campaigns are being launched with a great deal of good will and the european union is very active too
this is praiseworthy in itself
we must address the problems facing the roma in the candidate member states themselves which is after all where they live
in fact we should do this as soon as possible in order to avoid this problem becoming our problem in six years or so
mr president human rights fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are the alpha and omega of any political system
we take them for granted but it appears that in our ultracivilised europe they are not always observed
the fact that the institution of exile is still in force in some member states is incompatible with all the principles of human rights
however where there is political responsibility this should not be a problem
we must overcome this and incite our governments to be european through and through
i am not the first person to say this the european union is not cannot and must not be a purely economic union
mr president we might call today s sitting a sitting in celebration of human rights
those with ulterior motives might say that europe is engaging in selfflagellation
i believe that europe is reviving its hopes and its prospects
human rights issues spearhead and underpin the development of europe
and when it comes to human rights we must never ever make concessions
we demand various criteria of the countries which will accede and of other countries wherever they may be
the death penalty is an example
all four reports on which we shall be voting are good reports
they need some improvement and i think that the entire house will help without any expediency or ulterior motive
turkey  the commission report notes no progress on the fundamental kurdish issue
in short turkey still fails to satisfy the copenhagen criteria
we are in favour of turkey s joining the european union
however we must not make concessions on questions of principle for anyone
it is based on fundamental european values which per se vehemently oppose racism xenophobia and antisemitism
there are various sections of the population in the candidate countries in the candidate countries which merit our particular attention
but we must help them with training
the second group which i should like to mention are the kurds
i consider this stance to be wrong and one which contradicts the declarations of the council of europe
i therefore think it extremely important that we help the kurds gain their rights in a reasonable and peaceful manner
the belder report also states this unequivocally
the third group which i should like to make special mention of is to be found mainly in estonia and latvia i refer to the russianspeaking minorities
the monitoring centre for racism and xenophobia will open in vienna on  april
after all i launched an attack on this subject when i was italian minister for justice and my righthand man in that operation was the most important the most famous and the greatest of all italian magistrates giovanni falcone
mr president ladies and gentlemen i do not intend this to be a very long speech
in some cases there has been agreement with the form but probably not with the content
i have referred to our external presence and to the internal dimension
austria has undeniably been a country that has met its european union obligations
today in the european union citizenship means european citizenship
an austrian citizen is a portuguese citizen
a portuguese citizen is an austrian citizen
this cannot be viewed as a matter of indifference to the other countries
that simply is not true
as i have already said austria s internal affairs are also the european union s internal affairs
there are naturally some controversial issues in this area and people may see things in various different lights in different areas
and there is going to be an interesting test of this in the form of the charter of fundamental rights of citizens of the european union
this is a task not just for governments but also for nongovernmental organisations for social lobbies and for political lobbies
we need to keep this question on our agenda and that is the rationale and the significance of this debate
the measures that have been developed include a set of initiatives connected with the european year against racism in 
our present experience suggests that it would probably be advisable to improve these provisions that is to improve these articles
we shall see whether in the course of the intergovernmental conference we can achieve a consensus that will allow us to make further progress on this matter
let me start with the malmstrom report
i think the first annual report of this new european parliament is thorough and timely
it will cover many of the areas in the report and all the european parliament s recommendations provide extremely useful input for our work
i cannot respond to all of the points in the report at this stage
the european initiative for democracy and human rights reflects this
women are explicitly included as a target group for support
issues such as violence against women have been rightly categorised as issues of human rights
as such they should be promoted vigorously as part and parcel of our foreign policy and development assistance
from the horrors of rape to genital mutilation from the home to the prison cell
our programmes daphne and stop are the mainstay of the commission s response
a new daphne programme for  was adopted in december  at a level of eur  m a year
we will look in the commission at ways in which we can contribute to the search for a solution
the commission is also working with others to halt the heinous trafficking of women which has been growing in the last few years
we produced a communication in  on this subject
we are working on this as the honourable member knows with ngos the osce and candidate countries
a new stop programme is planned to start from this year and this will be open to accession countries
ngos and civil society partners are integral to their implementation
the projects are often carried out in sensitive or dangerous conditions in the field
the former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable
we could not work without ngos
we will not alas see an overnight change
the size of the budget cannot be divorced from the question of our capacity to manage it
broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy
the possibility of creating a human rights agency as foreseen in vienna and cologne could help us here
i believe that such an agency should be operational not advisory
i will be exploring this in the communication
i am responding to this on my own behalf and that of my colleague commissioner verheugen
i would like to congratulate the authors of the comprehensive report
i hope this response will set a few pointers for the future
these discussions have produced concrete results
the second element our cooperation programmes include the phare national programmes phare democracy and the meda programme
this reform helps to bring about the necessary changes in attitudes within institutions
we will persevere with such measures
we are also open to opportunities for strengthening them
the new access programme which replaces the lien and partnership programmes aims to strengthen civil society
these reports cover extremely important issues
i am grateful to parliament for its timely input
the commission and parliament are well placed to work together on human rights
we are well placed to give a strong lead to others
madam president i too should like to ask in what capacity you made this statement
i should like it recorded that what mr pirker has said had nothing to do with the agenda
madam president i am grateful for this opportunity to clarify once again the capacity in which i made those observations
the  countries three levels of response as regards austria are therefore bilateral in nature
it was not by chance that the party with the second largest vote in the austrian elections was not invited to form the government
it was not by chance at all
that is quite clear
we regret that this is how things have to be and we hope that matters will develop in austria in such a way that we can act differently
the signature of this convention is certainly compatible with the preparation of a binding charter of fundamental rights
i therefore share the rapporteur s and parliament s concerns
all these instruments are currently being examined by the council
these measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of february 
turning now to the ludford report i very much welcome the opportunity to respond to parliament s report on racism and xenophobia
but besides that i think that in many quarters there is growing recognition of the need for european action against racism
that is why in the article  proposals we are able to make greater progress i believe on racial discrimination than on the other matters
we felt that it was politically possible
we sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope
as you know the package of proposals that the commission has put forward consists of two directives and an action programme
the proposed directives are complemented by a proposal for an action programme
getting the member states to adopt the antidiscrimination package is now our top priority
parliament has a key role to play in this regard
madam president allow me briefly to correct what the presidentinoffice of the council said
at most mr presidentinoffice you can therefore only speak of twelve countries
mrs flemming the debate on austria should not be restarted as we have already had an exchange of views on this issue
madam president i seldom make use of these rules but i must do so now for the record
during the debate mr gollnisch a member of the french extreme right attacked me personally
mr gollnisch stated for my benefit during his speech that his family and these were his words would never accept fascism
that is where mr gollnisch clearly differs from his family because he himself accepts fascism or to put it plainly he is a fascist
mr schulz we have noted your statement
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon
eurodac
the next item is the joint debate on
last year this parliament was consulted twice about the establishment of a system for comparing fingerprints
in principle the system is intended to correctly implement the dublin convention
on  april  this parliament rejected the council s proposal to extend the eurodac system to illegal immigrants by means of a protocol
this parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of amsterdam
we were once again told that this system has to be developed in order to correctly implement the dublin convention
this is not a trivial question
we have all managed very well to really work together with you and the same applies of course to commissioner vitorino
but when it comes to eurodac we have a problem
and we have given our reasons
we highlighted all these problems in a resolution by parliament
it started back in dublin in 
in november  we here in parliament and i assume you too commissioner believed that we were on the home stretch and were finally going to be able to implement eurodac
that too was a very positive aspect
how will the system actually be configured
some of parliament s amendments were in fact incorporated into the proposal for a regulation which is a point i wish to stress
we hope that this will happen shortly perhaps even during the portuguese presidency
mr president the statements by the presidentinoffice of the council go straight to the heart of the problem facing us here
some members are saying we should not fingerprint fourteen to eighteenyearolds
i personally take a different view on this
it is incomprehensible
it comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law
there is a lack of parliamentary scrutiny and no precise guaranteed legal recourse it is there in principle but it has never been accurately described
the same applies to parliamentary scrutiny
otherwise parliament would have to reconsider the budget and the question of financing the system from the community budget
and believe me we shall do so
this is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy
there is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply
i am not sure that this has really been done
are the council and the commission so convinced
mr president we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in europe
that means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls
it is perfectly clear that there is abuse for example in connection with asylum claims
it has already proven its efficacy on several counts and it is essential if asylum is to gain acceptance
that is the task now before the council
it is we feel putting the cart before the horse
we should start by harmonising this policy we can look at the instruments for implementation and control after that
finally a third point which particularly concerns us is the dismissal of parliament s opinion
this raises a vital question about the democratic credit granted to the members of the european parliament
it is a shame that we are currently being given the impression that we serve no useful purpose
the eurodac initiative is a series of absurdities and outrages
to confuse asylum seekers with illegal immigrants contravenes the convention on refugees
what i would therefore urge the commission and the council to do is to allow eurodac to die a peaceful death as it deserves to do
the system is quite in accordance with the creation of an area of freedom and justice and this is something we support
i personally am among those who have serious reservations about the system
i would also like to confirm as the representative of the council has already said that there is a problem concerning the territorial application of the eurodac regulation
i can also confirm that the council did not ask the commission to come forward with a revised proposal
the commission in this case has a different position from both the council and parliament
we considered that  years old is an adequate solution
i still remember that it was a major event in my youth to get my own identity card
nevertheless i recognise this is a very sensitive question
consequently the commission believes it should clarify to parliament two very strict and clear ideas
first we should not ask eurodac to give answers that eurodac cannot give
we will come to parliament and the council with proposals in the next few months
we have just achieved this week a working document to reevaluate the dublin convention itself
we do not want to lose time
we want to have as broad a picture as possible for all instruments that concern asylum policy
where is the point of difference between the commission and the council
but there is a point where the commission does not agree with the council
we do not agree that the council should reserve for itself the powers of implementation of the system
maybe i am being stubborn but this is what i sincerely believe
thank you commissioner
the joint debate is closed
trade in bovine animals and pigs
if the commission is leaving itself an escape clause in the form of a threeyear postponement why should we keep to our side of the bargain
however here too we said that we wanted to help out
we are calling for article a to be deleted
i hope that the commission is able to accept this amendment
this is a codecision process
we have already had intensive discussions
i am curious to see what the outcome of your position will be
in the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties
indeed in scotland my own country we have witnessed a  reduction in the national herd in the past twelve months
unless urgent action is taken by the uk government a further  will go within the next few months
these factors are driving uk pig farmers out of business as more and more cheap imports are sourced by retailers and supermarkets in the uk
i hope this message is getting through to the british chancellor of the exchequer
this is a case of negligence on the part of the member states in putting these matters and the system into effect
mr president i would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur
he has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication
we need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while at the same time providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health
mr president this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to directive  applicable to the spanish government
these are already of course implemented by many other states
this exemption has important implications for my country
so rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough british vets to carry out the work
but instead of giving us more time the commission has commenced infringement proceedings
why is the commission giving spain such an easy time
on that basis i believe that this proposed directive is wrong and i will be voting against it
i think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in ireland
analysis of test data is carried out on an ongoing basis by a special tb investigation unit
routine postmortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the department on all animals slaughtered
animals which react positively to the tb test are slaughtered
i understand considerable work has been done on laboratorybased blood tests for tb
i would like the commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the eu
the tb test we use now is herdspecific not animalspecific
we need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up
plus animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money
i think that mr daul s proposed amendment of two years would be an excellent compromise
mr president i will try to be brief and i will not use all the time available to me but restrict myself to a short message
it is my opinion that this measure is suffering from a surfeit of rules
since  a series of laws have been adopted on this subject
now in all probability some of the states are at fault in that they have not aligned themselves with certain directives
however we have to ask why it is that this happens so often and in so many states
it is very likely that this is caused by difficulties in implementing the directives
the delays in the adaptation of national legislation may well be due to the expense and tedium involved as well as the fact that the process is often unproductive
the second amendment seeks to restrict the period of application of transitional measures to two years
however i regret that i am not in a position to accept written amendment no  which mr graefe zu baringdorf put forward last week
let me express my surprise and concern about this
the overall aim is to achieve quick and efficient results in order to translate policy into legislative acts
the framework for the comitology procedure is clearly established in the abovementioned council decision
the right of scrutiny for the parliament is foreseen for areas relating to codecision that is article 
the amended directive  is based on articles  and  of the treaty
that is and i am advised by the legal service the appropriate way to deal with this
that is why each individual provision which envisages such an amendment must identify the procedure quite clearly
therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of parliament
i will now make some remarks on the implications of the proposed amendment for the institutional balance
this system aims clearly at defining exactly the respective role of the executive and legislative power in the basic legislative instrument
the procedure must be made clear in the basic legislative provision requiring to be amended by comitology
any wording leaving room for casebycase negotiation would jeopardise the delicate institutional balance and also seriously undermine transparency
i am firmly committed to the procedure of codecision and i am firmly committed to the procedures laid down in comitology
to deviate from that is to risk challenge in the european court which is something that i must avoid
they are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately
however it is in the interest of all the institutions that the procedures are clearly defined and transparent for everybody
consequently i cannot accept the amendment of mrs auroi either
you are of course quite correct in relation to that
that agreement however was reached with the council subsequent to the initial drafting of this document
that is why it has been drafted in this way
it predates that agreement
it will be automatically amended in the manner envisaged in the agreement with the council
therefore the concerns that you have in relation to this matter will be remedied automatically in accordance with that agreement
you also suggested that if the commission goes along with your suggestion that there will be a shortened procedure
mr president allow me to ask commissioner byrne one more question
we noticed that
we then table our proposed amendments which you consider to be correct as far as principle and procedure are concerned
the legal text is therefore confirmed
then we can use the simplified procedure
generosity is incumbent upon the commission not the rapporteur
it makes no sense to continue with the debate
i would ask the commissioner to reply as briefly as possible
i am afraid that what mr graefe zu baringdorf has said discloses a misunderstanding of the issue
that gives clarity to the situation
it avoids any exercise of discretion by the commission or anybody else
it leaves it clear to anybody reading the text what the appropriate procedure is that will govern this particular situation
thank you very much commissioner
the relevant committee will continue the discussion of this issue
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
question time council
question no  by h
does the council concur with that statement
a number of conclusions emerged from this work
lastly in  the commission adopted a further communication on new measures to combat trafficking in women
campaigns are being financed under the phare programme in this field some with support from the international organisation for migration
this is why this question needs to be tackled at the highest level and in particular in conjunction with the united nations
to this end the council recently adopted a decision authorising the commission to negotiate on this very protocol
the majority of cases involve women in illegal situations
this immigration is taking place in the worst possible conditions and these women are defenceless victims of every type of marginalisation and hardship
while adding my thanks to the council for the earlier answer i would like to press the council on a related matter
will the council raise this in their dialogue with romania in relation to romania s application for membership of the community
i detected a great commitment by the romanian authorities to going as far as possible to confront situations of this kind
question no  by h
if not does it intend to launch the procedures referred to in article 
mr president this question has already been broached here more than once
and this action may lead to the suspension of this member state s rights as a member of the european union
mr presidentinoffice i think that you have clarified the technical aspects of articles  and  very fully indeed
we still have an almost purely national framework for justice although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature
all the european union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli
hence my question what will happen in the future if we disregard the case of austria now
will the national prime ministers of the countries of europe pass judgement in future
will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed
in what way do the european council and the european institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result
is this a question of new competition between the european institutions and the national states
during an earlier debate i said that we are now all austrians within the european union and i would like to repeat that
and as i said this would be a purely bilateral matter
the austrians have every right to whatever government they want  but we have every right to our opinions about the austrian government
mr presidentinoffice of the council you said that there is a party in power in austria which has made racist comments in public
here in the european parliament people speak not parties
if so when will the council officially release the citizens of austria from this ordeal which violates their democratic rights
must each member state individually abandon the sanctions before the council comes to its senses and overturns the decision
i think mrs kauppi must have misheard or there must have been a mistake in the interpreting
i never said that the austrian government is a racist government let me make that quite clear
and the freedom party has not as yet made any statement totally repudiating its association with ideologies of this kind
as for the other question you have raised the answer is yes
any country can disassociate itself from the declaration made by the  countries
you also asked mrs kauppi when the council will allow the austrian people to escape from this pressure
first of all there is no council decision
as i have already said we are talking about  countries
this is not a european union issue
different individuals will have different perceptions of all this
i personally do not like sitting alongside fascists
question no  by h
in some cases the fuel shortage has claimed human lives
this programme started with two local authorities where the opposition held power
the european union subsequently decided acting on proposals from various member states to extend this system to five other municipalities
we hope that this signal from the european union will be heard by democratic forces in serbia
we are aware that this obviously has an impact on the civilian population
the point is whether or not a country has the right to decide its fate and choose its government
in yugoslavia the people decided democratically and yugoslavia has its government and its president
and whether we like it or not that is a fact
what sort of logic is it which in order to punish the supposed suppressor of a people punishes his supposed victims
if that is what mr korakas thinks exists in serbia then we know where we stand
this cooperation between the missions of member states will also cover information sharing on citizens who may be threatened with the death penalty
mr presidentinoffice of the council i am grateful for your words but not for their content
in other words i appreciate your concern but not the content of the information you have offered
it did not reply within the time period laid down and is replying now orally two months late
do you not think that this is rather difficult for the european citizens to understand
mrs diez gonzalez you have asked two questions the first concerns the reply and the time the council has taken to provide it
your comments make perfect sense
you will also be aware that consular cooperation within the european union is a recent development
it is a challenge which has still to be met but i understand what was meant by that comment
question no  by h
in my role as chairman of the preparatory group for the icg i will make sure to take account of this request regarding the icg
however no nonmember country has made use of this facility to date
furthermore the legal basis for this is the euratom treaty so that there is once again no provision for consulting the european parliament
thank you minister
so do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the igc
nevertheless we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the european parliament on this subject
question no  by h
mr president the reply by the presidentinoffice puts me in mind of the reply by pontius pilate
how exactly do things stand
this loan was signed and sealed and represents an obligation
it collects every last cent of the loans which it grants
the other issue is the tremendous damage caused by germany s occupying forces in greece
this comes to some usd  billion
other countries have been paid
greece has not
why
of course the greek governments bear some responsibility but at some point all this needs to be analysed
germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time
however it has failed to honour it on various pretexts
now there are no longer any excuses and it is dutybound to pay and the council cannot wash its hands
i consider the reply by the presidentinoffice to be unacceptable
question no  by h
 to  of the films showing in sweden are however american
up to  state aid for film production is allowed in the eu at present
does the council agree that state aid is important to promote european culture
does the council not consider it important to encourage diversed european film production
in fact the council understands that as part of its programme the commission is holding discussions with member states on this very subject
i would like to thank the council s representative for his reply
we are aware that film production is dependent on aid as it is a combination of culture and commercial production
we are also concerned about this
question no  by h
if we went down that path we would certainly be entering very dangerous territory
this means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process
other countries have different systems and these have just as many virtues as my own
we are all european citizens and we are all citizens of a european union which is underpinned politically speaking by a basic set of principles
if these principles are at risk we have the right  and the duty  to sound the alarm
but whether lists of parties are desirable or otherwise i hope that this never becomes a matter for the european union
yes but the problem of course is that this is what we are concerned with here
up until now it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions
it is therefore opinions which you have punished and not actions
knowing the answer to these questions would be useful as a guide to the consumer but it may well be that the action taken by the  prime ministers is a source of regret
we are not working at council level here the european union has not taken a single discriminatory measure against austria
however mr bonde you should not of course confuse economic and monetary union with nazism they are in fact slightly different
it is therefore quite natural mr bonde that certain governments should feel somewhat uneasy
this uneasiness is only being reflected in bilateral relations
we are not confusing community matters with bilateral matters
question no  by h
this is in fact one of the achievements of the much maligned treaty of amsterdam which people need to be regularly reminded about
it is also possible to obtain information on the legislative transparency of the council by email
the current presidency has been following this practice
i would like to thank the presidentinoffice for a very long detailed and serious reply
for now i would like you to give me a very simple reply to a very simple question of principle
would you accept that principle
mr president during the finnish presidency we were able to get through twenty questions in question time
last time we covered twelve with portugal as the country holding the presidency
it seems as if we will not get through any more than that today either
 pt i have two points to make mr seppanen
firstly if that was how parliament saw things we could even give not twenty but thirty answers to honourable members questions
but we can also opt for a bureaucratic officious quick artificial and probably unsatisfactory answer
we would then  in quantitative terms  be more successful in giving answers to this house
i would be grateful if you could rephrase your question mr nicholson because i did not grasp what you were saying
excuse me but could you put the question in a different way
you were saying that the council is not alone in being a legislature that makes its decisions in secret
i just wondered if you could give us examples of other similar organisations in government that make these decisions in the same way
governments legislative role is normally exercised in restricted closed meetings in every country in the world
therefore to the best of my knowledge in the majority of countries throughout the world governments do their work in closed sessions not open to the public
mr seixas da costa had informed us that he had to leave at  pm
he has also pointed out that he has been working with us since  am
i believe that today he has earned his salary as a minister and as presidentinoffice of the council
we will therefore conclude questions to the council and thank him for being here
questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the council
the sitting was closed at  pm
mr evans has the floor
evans robert pse
all members have this morning received a booklet containing  pages of rollcall votes
i am sure this is of interest to a number of members and there will be a few members who want to look at it
i wonder if you could ask the services to have another look at this please president
thank you mr evans
your comments will be passed on not to the services of course but to the bureau
eumexico interim agreement
once it has been ratified by all the member states it will replace the cooperation agreement signed between the community and mexico in 
mr president i should like to start by thanking mrs ferrer for her excellent report
we cannot renegotiate the agreement
all in all our group will vote in favour of this trade agreement which we welcome
in fact chocolate  chocolatl  is a mexican word
we can therefore use past experience to help develop future relations with mexico
the advantage to mexico is obvious
this agreement will enable mexico to redress the imbalance of its oneway dependence on the usa to a certain extent
i should like to remind the house that  of mexico s exports go north and only  come to europe
mexico stands to gain here by achieving a better trade equilibrium
as far as trade is concerned there are advantages all round
i should like to go briefly into or at least touch on two problems
when free trade increases there are also losers
poverty in mexico has risen rather than fallen
social policy is therefore an important area for mexico and we should build this into the dialogue with mexico
the second is scientific and technical cooperation
i think that there is potential here which can be exploited between europe and mexico
there have been certain changes in mexico recently since the announcement and approval of the agreement largely in a positive direction
if that does not happen there is a risk that this very significant agreement will not be worth the paper it is written on
both we and the people of mexico set great store by this agreement
they see it as a chance to correct their oneway dependence on nafta
the eu has kept derogations open for itself here
mexico has none
a free trade agreement at the cost of the mexicans 
it was under this banner that the mexican civil society called a few days ago for the senate to improve the agreement and not to rush into signing it
some points even contradict the mexican constitution
we here in the european parliament do not oppose an agreement with mexico
on the contrary
i would like to thank the rapporteur mrs ferrer for the recommendation on the implementation of certain articles of the ecmexico interim agreement on trade
however these criticisms are decisive and have led us to oppose the motion
at the same time the saint andres agreements and the rights of the indigenous peasants are not being observed
all this is common knowledge and i need say no more
mr president we regard the title of the agreement which is the subject of mrs ferrer s report as at best incomplete at worst dissembling
under these conditions how can anyone justify the fact that the respective markets will be liberalised at different rates to the detriment of the europeans
what is more this agreement means we are also strengthening the country s democratisation process
but politically and geopolitically the fundamental weight has essentially lain with the united states its powerful neighbour to the north
but mexico has also made great progress on human rights
so for both economic and political reasons we urge approval of this agreement
mr president the group of the greenseuropean free alliance does not have a common position on this issue
our decision has nothing to do with her work it relates to the situation in mexico
mr zedillo promised to let me have full details to prove to me that our concern was groundless
nor should we forget the opportunities represented by this market of  million people
the european parliament s delegation for relations with the countries of central america and mexico will be visiting that country
we are not going just for institutional dialogue between partners between the congress and the european parliament
we are going to talk to nongovernmental organisations
we are also going to chiapas to talk to the indigenous people and representatives of local society
i support the agreement in its entirety for it certainly represents a step forward
however i also call for scrutiny care and prudence regarding this agreement for its entire duration
these results of the trade negotiations are based on the eumexico agreement to which this parliament gave the green light on  may last year
this agreement is based on human rights and democratic principles
it covers all our relations with mexico notably cooperation and political dialogue
the negotiating results are balanced ambitious and offer a window of opportunity for both sides
ec operators will be very rapidly able to compete on the mexican market on an equal footing with industries elsewhere notably the united states
thank you very much mr liikanen
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  noon
information society for all
the adoption of the gsm standard has meant that the european union has a tremendous advantage
i hope that there will be support for those because they go into a considerable amount of important detail
other amendments are looking at matters relating to disability rights
i should like to use my final few seconds to draw to your attention three projects in my own area
finally some comments mr president on what the future holds
many thanks for your report and your skill mrs read
the new society must not exacerbate inequality between men and women
commissioner there are great opportunities here but they must reach all the people
and we want the european social model to be defended
what must the european union do within the framework of the eeurope initiative
first we must create an open modern highperformance multimedia infrastructure
secondly we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce
thirdly we need an eeurope test bench for european initiatives
consequently it is advisable to set all initiatives at european level on the eeurope test bench in other words
the president cut the speaker off mr president i apologise
please be so kind as to allow me to finish my sentence
mr president congratulations are in order today of course to mrs read on her excellent report and to commissioner liikanen
this is a positive debate very positive for europe and widespread interest has been shown as evidenced by the large number of amendments
i know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of europe
we must not forget people with disabilities
we must prevent divisions divisions between the regions of europe between the households of europe and between the individuals of europe
we can also see this from the followup document prepared by the commission
the initiative is important if we are to stop having to say that the united states is the overall leader within this developing field
the united states occupies second place
finland norway and denmark follow in that order
scandinavia is acquitting itself well with its social infrastructure and also perhaps with its pensions systems
we ought to bear this in mind something i am convinced the commission has done
we should also remember that the eu countries are very different from one another and that developments are very rapid
this must be reflected in the action plan
it is also important that the countries which are forging ahead most quickly should not be checked in their development
the consumer has to be king when it comes to electronic commerce otherwise it will not properly take off
the issues of broadband communications and of good infrastructure are on the agenda in the majority of countries
there is a need for diversity but now more standards are being sought for digital subscriber lines with the help of which it will be possible to upgrade the network
it is widely maintained that telephone companies are not making use of the available technology because standards are lacking
smart cards encryption mobile phones and eeurope constitute our strength
we shall persist with developments in these areas but when it comes to standards we need to pursue further development
our task is to legislate more quickly and to make for new patterns of legislation where possible
i am glad that this point is made in the report
i should like to turn my attention first to the policy approach of the eeurope initiative and to the approach taken by the read report
the internet email and mobile telephones will apparently do away with unemployment
but the reality of the matter is somewhat different
the it boom is confronted by mergers and redundancies
history teaches us that this approach has failed
industrialisation atomic energy and biotechnology have not brought freedom and prosperity for all
initiatives and reports are informed by the concept that the playing field should be levelled for the youngest and best
unfortunately this concept totally ignores the fact that this group already represents the winners while the general mass goes away emptyhanded
we should hold our principle of equal opportunity up to the light of truth
the commission s proposal aims to create equality through market liberalisation
in the case of information technology however we start with a totally different set of coordinates
for example there are numerous initiatives to promote the internet and computers in schools
that brings me to my next controversial point civil rights
what we in fact need is a concept for universal data protection
it means a step in the direction of seethrough man and yet more state interference in our private lives
it is being used to deliberately plan and implement a further massive restriction of fundamental rights at european level
how can these two things be reconciled
in the light of echelon  i am calling for a rethink of this matter
data protection and encoding are what we need
for the rest the citizens must control the state not the other way around
mr president in the original paper in english the commission uses the words information society and not knowledge society 
these are two different things
the information society is the chaos society
the information society has to date made its presence felt in the form of price quotations on a chaotic stock market
the prices of shares in technology have risen in a such a way which cannot be justified economically
in that way the information society emerges as a bubble economy a symbol of social inequality and imbalance
their revolution has been to sell computers and software to everyone
the rest of us should start a counterrevolution
we should set our aims higher than the commission has done
we have to demand a knowledge society for all rather than the chaotic information society we are getting
at its best the knowledge society can be a social dimension of the new capitalism
the information society for all is too undemanding too commercial and too culturally restricted a goal
we should want a knowledge society for all that is democracy
yet i fear that the catalogue of good intentions before us today may in fact make it more difficult to achieve the objective we are seeking
the president cut the speaker off
the new economy is here to stay in europe too
the european response to new challenges and exploiting opportunities has however been a long time coming
the proposals for reform in the initiative are ambitious but do not even necessarily go far enough
the initiative should also be supplemented by the future challenges facing those countries with a more advanced information society
commissioner i appreciate the amount of work that you to your credit have carried out regarding these issues relating to the information society
the amount is much too small
fortunately the commission has shown initiative in this matter however and has focused attention on accelerating developments here
speedy developments in the information society will drastically change our environment and our working and living conditions
as european legislators we have before us an immense challenge if we intend to keep legislation abreast of the times
control of the new operational environment will also require increased technical and pedagogic facilities and resources in training schemes
consequently there will have to be more focus on the training of teaching staff in european educational and training programmes
there is a genuine need for this given the suspicion with which our fellow citizens approach these new tools
moreover i set great store by protecting small and mediumsized businesses with special emphasis on the small businesses
in this connection it is important to ensure that guarantees are provided for advertising purposes
farreaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed
that means it is lagging behind the united states which indeed no one would deny
but having said that we should evaluate the quality of this backwardness economic political and social
how do we measure it
the commission says it wants to launch a political initiative so let us take it at its word
yes it is backward in terms of the development of ecommerce made possible by the internet
but are these two forms of backwardness the same
that is the impression the commission s initiative could give
the question that has not been asked is about the content of the information that is supposed to circulate thanks to this digital tool
will that content be standardised or will it reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of europe
will it be a social content or purely marketrelated
we need to evaluate them properly
the commission refers to europe s backwardness and the need to make up for it
technological progress is an alltoo familiar slogan
in fact the transformation we are witnessing is reminiscent of what happened with the invention of printing
we need to reflect very seriously about the challenges and changes it is bringing about
moreover one of the reasons why we have relatively high growth in the world economy and at the same time low inflation lies precisely in these new technologies
one such example is of course the area of education
we live at a time when education is becoming ever more important as a factor in production
knowledge has a clear tendency to increase or to expand when it is used
it opens the door to incredibly exciting developments where democracy and justice are concerned
that is why the proposal in this report according to which resources for education and learning would be made available is so important
this is important in our own part of the world but is also of course especially important in poor countries
i hope that the experience which will be gained by the eu in this area will also be used as part of our collaborative work on development
i would urge mr liikanen to have a detailed discussion with mr nielson on that issue
we are only at the beginning of an important discussion and i look forward to further stimulating dialogue
thank you mr liikanen and mrs read for an interesting report
however i should like to raise three points which perhaps merit our attention
improvements are therefore needed here
secondly how will our working life and employment relations change
will people be able to influence how they are organised
greater account needs to be taken of this
it opens up a global market place and almost limitless information to anyone with access to a computer screen
legislators cannot keep up with this technology even if they try to
technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market
but we all know that we need a base line of government involvement
we need a basic legislative framework for ecommerce
it is in our interest to make sure that we get the answers and our legislation right but also to get them through quickly
i think three points need to be noted as well as the risks and concerns to which they give rise
the first relates to the users and the risk of a gap emerging between the various victims of social exclusion
my third and last point relates to the question of public service and improving the democratic systems to develop procedures
the president cut the speaker off
i would therefore like to congratulate the portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit
that is a task for the council parliament and the commission
i wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens
mr president commissioner i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the successful work that has been done in so short a period of time
an information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the commissioner in this process
it is important and i thank her for it
agreement should be reached at lisbon on the principles of the sustainable funding of social security on account of this notion
it will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded
this i think should be stopped
it cannot be allowed to happen and i expect the commission to sit up and listen and take the necessary action
first there is the pragmatic deficit
i would not like to believe the council s conclusions will be restricted to this list
and finally there is the investment deficit
as the report rightly affirms the response to these problems cannot be left to the market alone
how can we become more competitive
how can we create new markets
how can we create permanent more highlyqualified jobs
we can take one of the leading roles in tomorrow s global information society provided that we learn the script
europe has talents
europe has skills
occasionally we lack competent directors to motivate us
i personally feel that it is important for broad target groups to take an active part in these serious changes
they need to familiarise themselves with the internet and data bases from an early age
mrs hieronymi pointed that out
schools without computers must become the exception
we need a qualification offensive with computeraided learning and active use of networks
the pace of change is hotting up in the european economy
undertakings are subject to constant restructuring new holdings strategic alliances and friendly or hostile takeovers
the consequences for both employees and managers is the same greater mobility and faster and faster adjustment
independence is increasing as is pseudoindependence
within companies responsibilities are changing
teams have shorter and shorter sellby dates
that has repercussions for the internal composition and the representation of the interests of employees
in addition trade unions in other areas fear that unregulated structures will spread and social standards will drop
the significance of ecommerce is difficult to overestimate
we must allow the market that is to say purchasers and vendors to choose for themselves
instead we must further deregulate markets so as to increase competition with a view to reducing prices
that is definitely the best way of making information services available to all citizens
we must increase competitiveness and the development of ideas in our part of the world that is to say in europe
avoid being so fearful and negative
take mrs villiers insights on board
adopt mr wijkman s global and positive attitude and learn from young mrs kauppi s experiences
we welcome the contribution of parliament to this very important policy debate
the commission is currently contributing to the preparation of next week s summit in lisbon
your support to move forward on these key elements of eeurope is most welcome
i would like to briefly respond to some items where the emphasis of the discussion has perhaps been a little different from the commission document
the commission is asked to include an eleventh action line on employment and social cohesion
i would like to mention especially the communication strategies for jobs in the information society 
the eeurope communication focuses on the actions necessary to accelerate the transition to the information society
your report expresses concern about the smart card action
the aim is not to disadvantage other technologies
finally i would like to close by thanking you once again for your work in this area
the efforts which you have made confirm that you share with us a sense of the importance and urgency of this issue for europe
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  noon
vote
i would like to see the importance of the issue reflected in the debate and vote in this house
so i would ask you to put it to the house that the debate be deferred to the next partsession in brussels
parliament agreed to the request
mr president i have asked to take the floor simply because the italian translation of paragraph c is very strange
we always have a check on the language versions to make sure they conform to the original language version at the end of the votes
parliament adopted the resolution
mr president one other brief point
it violates the rules of procedure and should not happen again
i have some sympathy with that remark
perhaps we should ask the rules of procedure committee to look at the precise procedural methods we use here
it is very clear that if a report has come from a committee the committee can request referral back
i was not sure so we should refer it to the rules committee
the commission has not expressed its opinion on that
we do not know exactly what the situation is at present
i also think parliament cannot be both judge and judged
i am not going to debate it
the easier thing is to put it to the vote
parliament rejected the proposal
mr president i agree with that remark for i am surprised at some of the statements made here
moreover mrs jackson i tabled numerous amendments calling for the series of paragraphs you had proposed to be deleted
mrs isler beguin was not in committee on the days we discussed these subjects
however i wanted to point this out
parliament adopted the resolution
joint motion for a resolution on support for the geneva convention of  august  and international humanitarian law
parliament adopted the joint resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
mr president before we vote on paragraph  i would like the rapporteur to hear what i have to say
i would like to know whether this clause has the same meaning in his language
would the rapporteur be so kind as to inform us whether his version is the authentic version for if so the meaning is the complete opposite to the italian
mr president i believe i can shed some light on the matter
i have read the french version of the text and it is completely different from the italian version at this point
this a serious translation error
the original version probably said not to imprison young people who commit offences except in special cases 
i think this is the root of the problem
i am able to confirm that it is mr imbeni s interpretation which is the correct one
the french danish and english versions are correct the phrase is to be understood as mr imbeni said
mr president if we change the meaning of the paragraph the debate will start all over again
it is a common occurrence in this parliament for texts not to correspond
do you remember when a few months ago we were told to distribute condoms to priests
this time according to some versions we are told to protect child abusers
mr president the rapporteur clearly explained the meaning of the text in the sense referred to by mr imbeni
you have read the english version of the text which is accepted by the overwhelming majority of those present
that would overcome all the difficulty
there is no ambiguity there is no uncertainty
mr president a number of words have been omitted from paragraph  of the danish version
it is the english version which is correct
parliament adopted the resolution
mr president i should like to make a point of order
we voted on this report in committee a committee on which all groups are represented
we dealt with  amendments to this report in committee we have now been presented with  amendments in plenary
this is not a legislative report
we ask the appropriate bodies in this house to look again at the way in which we organise our work
as it happens we have a report by mr provan in which the bureau is looking at how the plenary functions
so i agree with you one hundred percent
i want to ask you and those others who preside over these sessions to be much more strict about points of order
that hardly constitutes a point of order
i am usually accused of being too brusque with members who want to make a point of order
i suppose i cannot win
mr president you mentioned that you wanted to break off now
i urgently request that you continue the vote
we are fed up with constant changes to the agenda and postponements at short notice
if you are intending to postpone it to  pm it will totally distort the vote on this report
i urge that we carry on now understanding all the difficulties that you have mentioned
mr president ladies and gentlemen i understand what is being asked here
but what i have to say to you is this take a look around the house it has already voted with its feet
the members have already left
even the rapporteur does not want that
for the rest we can still vote at  this evening
that is quite in order
i think we should work here with a properlyordered procedure
we have already overrun by  minutes
i suggest that we vote this evening
mr president i should like to request that it not be taken this evening
the vote will be totally distorted
we know that a lot of people will leave this afternoon
they do not expect this kind of vote on a thursday afternoon
could we not postpone it until the april plenary session in strasbourg
i am afraid that would have to be decided before we take the vote this evening
this is shameful
we have been here for less than two hours and we have already had enough
what would sailors pilots drivers petrol station workers and doctors say
i find it absolutely absurd that we are not able to work for more than two hours at a time
you are just making the point that i made when i said we could not carry on with the votes
if the members had been prepared to wait half an hour longer before eating this would not appear to have been too great a sacrifice effectively it does cause problems when you randomly move important measures to a friday sitting
mr president i am sorry but i asked for the floor at the start
two specific points
first i wanted to vote for not against proposed amendment 
perhaps all the members should be reminded of that
members are supposed to work here through to friday so that we can use the afternoons to see our visitors
mr president perhaps i can be of help here
the rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion ie with the president s suggestion
please let us proceed thus
sarah ludford has stated that she agrees with that
so we vote at  pm on postponing the ludford report to the next plenary session
that is my motion
there is absolutely no problem with that
it is well within the rules it can be done immediately before the vote
it is normal procedure that is why i cannot take it now
the rules say you move postponement before the vote on the matter
that concludes the votes
explanations of vote  graefe zu baringdorf report a
ferrer report a
 da we cannot vote in favour of the report since there are gross abuses of human rights in mexico
a democracy clause was also built into the old trade agreement with mexico but this was not complied with
under the heading of trade we find a repeat of several of the most dangerous points of the mai multilateral agreement on investments
for all those reasons we shall vote against ratifying this agreement
duffvoggenhuber report a
who was consulted beforehand
no one and certainly not the national parliaments who had never heard of it
in any case whatever its final form the national parliaments should not have been sidelined
yes i did say the commission 
so the national parliaments find themselves sidelined and replaced by a body of officials who will proclaim the charter 
that is quite ludicrous
democracy is sidelined supposedly for the good of the citizens but then is that not how europe usually works
i would also like to have seen support for mr vidal s proposal
but i think that we have taken an important step here towards greater protection of minorities traditionally present in the european union
we cannot keep setting criteria for candidate countries which we fail to meet ourselves
a european constitution could provide the initial impetus for a superstate of this kind
i have therefore supported a number of amendments tabled by the uen group and the edd group with regard to the duffvoggenhuber report
however i had to consider their view of the world in my deliberations
this is why i was unable to support their proposals
so i want to claim the right to an individual and collective identity the right to diversity and difference
that is definitely a fundamental right worth defending in the european union
we are in favour of the drawing up of a charter of fundamental rights in the form of a political document
a charter could make a positive contribution to this
we have already emphasised that no more obstacles should be put in the way of enlargement of the union
it is therefore unrealistic to expect the issues to have been resolved by december
for that reason alone we do not think that fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the current intergovernmental conference
we have made this known in the individual votes en route to the report
it is therefore a matter of urgency that the nice summit should be able to make decisions concerning the amsterdam leftovers
the charter is an expression of the eu s ambition to bring the eu closer to its citizens
this way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a european community
the union is and should remain a union of states
nor do we support the constitutional process of which the adoption of a charter is an integral part
legal practice of this kind makes it possible to condemn an aspect of community law which is open to criticism and which has arisen through a member state s use of that law
we are therefore voting against the whole report
 fr our abstention from the vote on the charter certainly does not mean we are opposed to its european character
that charter will be a vital step towards the political deepening of the european union under the appropriate conditions
these people need a document to which they can refer when they take their case before the european court of justice
so we must provide for direct resort to that court in accordance with certain procedures
the people of europe expect us to take a very bold approach here
our demands are quite clear
the charter must have fully binding legal status by being incorporated in the treaty
to that end the committee on constitutional affairs calls on the council to put the charter on the icg agenda
any amendment of the charter must come under the same procedure as its original drafting procedure which means it would require the assent of the european parliament
the european parliament must approve any secondary legislation that might have a bearing on these fundamental rights
the charter must be binding upon the member states when applying or transposing provisions of community law
turning to the actual content of the charter it would seem advisable to divide up these rights into three categories
we need more time and debate on these potential conflicts
 sv at the council s meeting in cologne it was decided that an eu charter of fundamental rights should be prepared
the charter was to assemble and establish the rights which are to be found in the treaties and make them clearer and better known
we are however hesitant about making such a charter legally binding before it has been fully clarified what that would mean in practice
a charter of this kind should be based on the most progressive acquis and combine social and democratic rights
 sv we welcome the work which has now begun on preparing an eu charter of fundamental rights
the charter should concentrate on the relationship between citizens and the european institutions
its primary objective should be to guarantee that the union is governed openly
the charter should be legally binding through its also being incorporated into the eu s treaty
the charter must not only be a declaration but also entail obligations of some kind on the part of the eu s institutions and member states
 fr the charter of fundamental rights is the latest manifestation of the drift of community legislation towards a constitution
yet what worries me most is the content that is to be given to these rights
our society will no longer have a common destiny instead it will be based on a juxtaposition of minorities which each have their own rights but no common obligation
however we are at a very early stage in the process of determining the charter
it is therefore too early to say what should be legally binding
this decision will be made at a later stage as recognised by the report itself in paragraph 
this is a recognisable aim which british labour members would support
as the final charter text is not available we are supporting the charter in principle but awaiting the final version
 da the european union rests upon fundamental principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights
in my view a declaration would be more appropriate
the european convention on human rights is an excellent tool for protecting human rights in europe
at the same time it is the european court of justice s practice to take account of the national fundamental rights applicable in the member states
this practice could be affected if the eu were to obtain its own set of fundamental and human rights
jackson resolution b
indeed the commissioner in a response to the debate said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes
these are vital lifeline funds for jobs and growth
i therefore welcome the fact that this house voted by a majority against cutting off resources
there is no other explanation as to why the commission gave way yesterday and suddenly decided to reinterpret the structural funds regulation
how can the commission be credible visavis the european citizens if it is unable to implement its own requirements
we share the desire to protect an environment which it is our duty to pass on intact to our children
that is a laudable and necessary ambition
malmstrom report a
mr president i would like as a matter of priority to thank parliament for lending its support to aid for mongolia
i hope this will lead to a much more proactive approach on the part of the commission as i have not seen a sign of this yet
this parliament has noticed this and offered its support and i urge the commission to take this message extremely seriously and to grant this aid
a fairly substantial proportion of immigrant workers those regarded as not having the proper papers is being deprived of any legal existence
under these circumstances we are abstaining from the vote on this report
the european union has many instruments available in this field
there are also specific and horizontal actions relating to a given policy
they include in particular the fight to abolish the death penalty
obviously i agree with that
i want to express my unconditional support for that demand
allegations that such an echelon network exists are based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence
furthermore the democratic oversight of national intelligence services is in any case primarily a matter for national parliaments
political oversight is exercised by a house of commons committee which has full access to documentation
for example we do not share the enthusiasm for an eu charter of fundamental rights
we are concerned that it is minority differences that are stimulated with little emphasis on integration
we are opposed to the introduction of sweeping new categories of eligibility for asylum which would be open to abuse
many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle
and we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business
it is for these reasons that british conservatives have voted against the malmstrom resolution
haarder report a
the supporters of that theory should get their act together
mr president i should like to follow on from what mrs lulling has just said
on the contrary it is a guarantee of human rights
marriage and the family form the basis for human rights as does the right to life
i therefore believe that these points should have been left out of the human rights report
hence our support in principle
i am therefore able to tell the house that both felix habsburglothringen and karl ludwig habsburglothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction
the call on austria to take action in relation to freedom of movement is therefore devoid of any substance
that same article defines the family in terms of the marriage between a man and a woman
that service is a very good reason for granting the family special advantages reserved to it alone
 da we support the general recommendations in the report to the member states regarding compliance with the international conventions on human rights
we must grasp these new opportunities
that means the european union is founding its action on the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
i also find other proposals on improving the right of asylum most interesting they need to be quickly put into in practice
the european parliament must therefore remain vigilant
this is an issue which requires deeper analysis
 i believe that this is a good report and deserves support
however problems arise in the detail of paragraphs    and 
i voted for these paragraphs because i agree with the objectives of the rapporteur
i would however like to ensure that my voting intentions are not misinterpreted
firstly i do not support the right of gay couples to adopt
secondly i do not support the lowering of the age of consent below  years of age
with these clarifications entered for the record i am happy to vote for mr haarder s report
 on balance this is an excellent report with the exception of paragraphs  to 
this section is poorly drafted and ambiguous
it deals with issues that are firmly in the competence of each member state and should so remain
 fr i want to congratulate our rapporteur mr haarder on the quality of his report on respect for human rights in the european union
yet i would also like to draw my colleagues attention to two requests made in the report which i find problematic
parliament firmly rejects abuses of fundamental freedoms throughout europe as the haarder report emphasises
the republic cannot recognise specific minorities or communities  in its view there are only autonomous and free citizens with equal rights
but the fact remains that this is a choice and not an obligation
i will nevertheless vote for mr haarder s report because of its quality and its underlying philosophy
the european union turns a blind eye to situations in which human rights are being savagely violated in order to protect its imperialistic interests
its attitude towards the turkish regime is a blatant example
the effects of this policy are already visible in the rise of extremist fascist powers and racist perceptions and not just in austria
the report on combating racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been reached
for these reasons the three members of the european parliament of the greek communist party will abstain from voting
 fr i want to draw a parallel between the reports by mrs ludford and mr haarder and the report by messrs duff and voggenhuber
the european parliament is proposing to take part in drafting a european charter of fundamental rights
and why not
and above all what are we to think of our house s concept of these rights
freedom is not something that can be decreed
man cannot be regarded as an entity independent of those around him and concerned solely with his immediate wellbeing
the human being not only needs to be given the means to live but also and above all he needs the reasons to live
an additional charter european or not will certainly not provide them
 nl we have consented to the haarder report but would like to make the following observations regarding paragraphs  and  of the draft report
paragraph  urges belgium to sign the convention for national minorities
in the belgian federation the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution
without a doubt frenchspeaking belgian meps will again use this vote to play political games in belgium
we do not wish to participate in this and would emphatically disassociate ourselves from this kind of practice
moreover we regret that in paragraph  of the ludford report the same text was adopted for racism and xenophobia
 fr i want to explain the reasons underlying my rejection of the annual report on respect for human rights in the european union

perhaps that is what this whole exercise demands
alas the  vintage still goes along with this curious tradition
we therefore categorically reject any policy of quotas or positive discrimination those pet themes of political correctness
this role has been downgraded for far too long although it is a key role
how many of them have been forced to devote more time to their professional life than they would have wished
that kind of policy would mean giving the family its due place
but this report is an extremely dangerous allout attack on the family
let us make no mistake everyone leads the private life they want there can be no question of secret policing
the family on the contrary is the community on which society is based and that ensures its stability
if it is to fulfil its potential a child needs a father and a mother a stable family
in face of the culture of death it is our duty to stand up for the culture of life
he is worth much more than that every man is a sacred history
we fully subscribe to the international agreements to protect minorities and minority languages
that concludes the explanations of vote
the sitting was adjourned at  pm and resumed at  pm
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
western sahara
the next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mrs gonzalez alvarez and others on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left
b by mr sanchez garcia and others on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
b by mr carnero gonzalez and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists
b by mrs schroder and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
b by mr salafranca sanchez neyra and others on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats
on the western sahara
if obstacles continue to be put in the way we may be responsible for a more serious conflict
i am not shocked
i can understand it it is a solution nobody wants of course but it is one we are forcing them into
we do not want western sahara to become another east timor mr president
secondly there is the food crisis facing the sahrawi refugees in the desert camps
that is why we support the motion for a resolution
if there were to be another postponement it would seriously aggravate the problem
stability security and peace in the maghreb region depend on this referendum taking place
mr president after the vote in east timor the process of selfdetermination in western sahara is the last one outstanding in the world
i would even say that the transition to full democracy apparently under way in the kingdom of morocco also depends on it
direct dialogue between the parties is essential
the european union should make it a priority to help keep that process going to help it succeed
regrettably the union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now
much has been said but little has actually been done
that is how we can contribute to achieving a priority objective peace in the maghreb
selfdetermination in western sahara is essential for that
the constant postponement of the referendum on the future of the western sahara is unacceptable
a state of emergency reins in the occupied areas
at least  people have been arrested including  women for fighting for the right to selfdetermination
we call on the government of morocco to stop repression lift the state of emergency and permit freedom of expression
we call on the council of the eu to vote on joint action which will enable the peace plan to be duly implemented without delay
we urge the commission of the eu to ensure immediately that the people in the refugee camps have a secure supply of food
the supply situation has deteriorated dramatically
the council and the commission must therefore immediately exert pressure on the un to improve the food situation
the commission must set up a financial safety fund for the next three months
we had a similarly dramatic situation a year ago in east timor
a referendum was held a state of emergency followed
that is why we call on the commission and the council to act before it is too late
i also want to take the opportunity to appeal to the council
i am also particularly glad that commissioner nielson is present here today
they have ceased to provide aid and there is no effective coordination
mr president the western sahara issue is unfortunately familiar
the position of the european parliament has always been to support not the independence of the sahrawi but the right of the sahrawi people to freely express their views
even today this right is still being suppressed under various different pretexts
meanwhile the situation of the sahrawi people has become serious even their physical survival is under threat
the eligible voters were identified thanks to the effective un mission minurso
nor has it confined itself to these delaying tactics
the united nations must do its utmost to ensure that the referendum is held before the end of 
thank you very much commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  pm
mozambique
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr miranda and others on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left
b by mr queiro and mr ribeiro i castro on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group
b by mr van den bos on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
b by mrs carrilho and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists
b by mr rod and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
b by mrs maijweggen and others on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats
on the floods in mozambique
it is equally important that all the countries cancel mozambique s debt in full so as to facilitate its recovery
but we alone should not bear the blame for the delay
we should also be wondering what other countries in other continents are doing
what about india and pakistan which have substantial resources and large communities resident in mozambique
and what are the nearby african countries doing
but we need to make a distinction between the different situations of many african countries
we know this is not the situation in mozambique as poor as the country may be
mr president the media have portrayed a distorted image of the disaster which struck mozambique
whilst the world witnessed scenes of desperate people on rooftops and in trees aid had already got under way off camera
but the other side of the coin is that disasters which do not reach the news to all intents and purposes do not exist
according to the organisations involved despite everything aid has got under way relatively quickly
this may be true but this does not apply to the primary rescue operations
it was not the commission which was responsible for this but the governments
aircraft helicopters food and medicine must be available on demand and at a moment s notice
and i mean literally at a moment s notice
the waiting period should only be determined by the distance involved not the red tape
there is a need for much better cooperation between the aid organisations and the armed forces to this end
it is commendable that commissioner nielson travelled to mozambique so quickly
the  million aid package is sufficient for now but will need to be increased at a later date
mozambique has now entered an extremely difficult phase
diseases must be kept at bay the landmines littering the area must be cleared and rehousing schemes must be established
for many mozambicans the misery is only just starting now that the media have packed up and moved on
it is therefore up to us parliament the council and the commission to closely monitor the victims ourselves
the european union must never behave like this again
in particular the member states must cancel their share of mozambique s external debt
it is sad that this should happen to one of the world s poorest countries as well
i think it would be fitting to pay tribute to them for these efforts
meanwhile we have heard from commissioner nielson that a great deal more was done than was made known
the funding which has been set aside for this project is considerable
it would be good of course if these debts were actually suspended for then the mozambique government could use the funds for this purpose
mr van den bos has also pointed this out
i think it is only fair to clarify this here
as you are aware i visited mozambique on  and  march together with the portuguese state secretary mr amado
from the onset of the crisis the commission has addressed the consequences of the floods in mozambique in a comprehensive manner
the commission is insisting on the need for reinforced coordination with the government around the shared comprehensive reconstruction framework
a donor core group is meeting every week in maputo with the government at ministerial level
the eu presidency and the commission delegation are members of that group
additional resources up to eur  m could be made available
within this mozambique figures among the retroactive cases and will be eligible for debt relief under the enhanced hipc initiative this year
constraints have been identified in this terrible disaster case
this is not easily done
finally i would like to emphasise the figures concerning the international response
in money terms we have contributed quite well
thank you very much commissioner nielson
we all hope that our aid really will help the people get over the worst of it
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  pm

presidential elections in peru
the european parliament has already had occasion to condemn this type of action by president fujimori
yes there are still elections in peru there are political parties there are means of communication and there are certain guarantees
but the guarantees are not complete
that means the guarantees are not complete
there is no independence of the judiciary or of the legislature
i think we should ask the government of peru to review that decision
i should also like to warn against judging just one side and apportioning blame solely to the russian side
they must be investigated and the guilty must be called consistently to account
but we should also give the competent russian authorities the chance to do this themselves
i suggest no sanctions no economic sanctions against russia should be considered at this time
we have a duty now that the war is almost over to have access to victims and to give aid for rehabilitation
mr president i must contradict mr markov quite categorically
that is reason enough not to ask russia to investigate infringements and war crimes
what we need is the international criminal court and we must bring those responsible to justice
that is why i warn against a pseudo balanced approach
so we need to ensure that a negotiated solution is reached with the elected representatives of the chechen people
we interceded for the release of the russian journalist mr babitsky
it is a scandal and we cannot accept it
freedom of the press for russia is also a service to the russian people
mr president it would seem that a war that was started to end terrorism is turning into a situation where a new terrorism is just starting
it seems to be becoming a permanent phenomenon in the region
we have condemned the russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions
there has been a certain amount of onesided thinking in them here and there which has not made them any more effective
the extension of the war and terrorism is a major threat to us all
in addition speedy and unhindered access to the area on the part of relief organisations must be guaranteed once and for all
thirdly the war must be stopped and talks begun
and fourthly russia s active participation in the work against international terrorism and the illegal arms trade is essential
in this we recognise the shortsightedness of our own policies
mr president ladies and gentlemen we know that russia s international standing has been seriously damaged by the chechen war
except that the russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact
we reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the russian government
it would make a great deal of sense if the proposals by the german government were adopted by all the member states
this is a despicable war whose prime victims are the people of chechnya but also the young russian soldiers
we are also appalled however at the attitude of the western powers in particular the european ones
what public opinion sees is a few declarations condemning certain aspects of the war in chechnya what we are actually seeing is political and financial support for the kremlin
many of the parties represented here in parliament form part of governments that are pursuing this policy of conciliation and support
freedom of the press in serbia
this is something which the world s dictators have always known
this is now happening every day in serbia
the few independent tv and radio stations in serbia are being harassed and persecuted in order finally to be closed down entirely dissenting voices are silenced
a desperate dictatorial leader is oppressing his own people mr milosevic is threatening montenegro attacking the weak opposition in serbia and infiltrating kosovo
mr milosevic and his fellow criminals must be removed democracy must be saved
the situation in yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day
in fact it seems as if mr milosevic and his friends are playing a threeway game by means of which they are trying to deregulate anything which can possibly be deregulated
tension surrounding montenegro is mounting
it shows that every effort is being made to keep out outside influences
there is also talk of curtailing communication by telephone email and keeping tabs on written correspondence
the government seems keen to remove the opposition from local authorities where they have been entitled to be since the previous local elections
i find this a dangerous game
it seems to be heralding the elections in a perverse kind of way
the campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut
it is really unacceptable that elections will soon take place  allegedly formal democratic elections  in a country where the opposition has first been left without any tool to express itself
i am in favour of this but it can never replace support provided to the media in yugoslavia in serbia media which deserve this support
the eu makes a difference the eu has made a difference in the past with its support
at the finance conference on the stability pact the european union can and must commit itself to a number of programmes
the programmes are ready the necessity is there let us take swift and unambiguous action
various actions have been undertaken on the part of the european union such as providing independent stations with equipment
alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in croatia and also in montenegro
it is unfortunate that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided nationally
it has become clear over the last two years that the media are being increasingly sidelined
but we have already said that
how weak must the milosevic regime really feel given how it treats the media
i think he is terrified of this and we should help the media so that they can spread the truth about milosevic and his regime
mr president apparently the milosevic regime is not tired of fighting battles not by a long shot
recently it has taken systematic action against local stations in particular it does not flinch from using violence in these activities
they are then termed rather scornfully nato agents and traitors of the mother country 
the target regional radio and television stations is an obvious one from a milosevic viewpoint
what did receive the official seal of approval for the serbian population however were the politically correct pop music stations of slobo s son marko and daughter marija
given this sad situation all those in serbia who stand up for the freedom of the press deserve our support
milosevic s willing servants are then welcome to hold on to the confiscated technical equipment
situation in iraq
imposed on the iraqi people i should say
they have made sure that iraq has no longrange missiles that could threaten its neighbours
that is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted
nonetheless the us government refuses to definitively lift the embargo on the pretext that iraq has not respected its obligations
without offering the slightest proof washington continues to accuse iraq of secretly manufacturing biological and chemical weapons
washington has refused this proposal too thus creating a situation which primarily hits the iraqi people and not their leaders
according to that delegation the oil for food programme is a totally inadequate response to the urgent physical needs of the iraqis
mr eric rouleau the former french ambassador speaks of a slowmotion genocide
our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation
however we also think we need a broader debate on this subject
that is why we are not putting this resolution to the vote today
on an issue as serious as this one we prefer first of all to call for a commission and council declaration
we are therefore proposing that this debate be deferred to the month of april
i feel that we should focus our attention on the possibility of preventing this from happening
iraqis are not going to die of starvation
i feel that our resolution should also serve to reassure the state of israel
so the debate continues and the resolutions are withdrawn
mr president i too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place
i am concerned as are the other speakers at the plight of the people in iraq
one should never forget that the plight of the people in iraq is being inflicted upon them by their own government
we want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can
mr president the un sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction claiming at least  children s lives every day
furthermore the shortage of medical and food aid has made deaths from these treatable diseases epidemic
the sanctions constitute relentless lethal force and innocent iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price
it cannot continue
whatever the details whichever way you look at it it is a damned dangerous situation which we have to avoid
without making a value judgement i think that both countries india and pakistan must exercise extreme restraint
we have to support all available initiatives
we are not the ones in the hot seat when it comes to taking initiatives
what we must not do is keep quiet
india and pakistan have carried on this conflict for over fifty years now
but whatever happens the human rights abuses must stop
i was even more moved when i went into a tent where the women and children were
that woman was sobbing her heart out
i could almost touch the pain really feel the pain of that woman
she was not acting it she was not pretending it  nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun
they were there because they had been tortured they had been mistreated and they were escaping
that was not an isolated incident and it is still happening today
we must find a solution
they must come to the negotiating table
it is long overdue for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined
relations between india and pakistan are indeed deteriorating with kashmir being a particular bone of contention
tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers
indeed in the herald tribune of tuesday march   the headline reads nuclear war between india and pakistan is a real possibility 
it is increasingly an international problem and one where mediation will in my view become essential
so what can we do to bring longterm stability to this volatile region
i am then often ashamed at how little influence we can exert as a huge economic power in the political field
this is why i welcome the debate on this conflict today
very often the people who actually live there are not taken into account
this appears to have awakened world opinion again
i am convinced that international mediation is desirable and necessary
in the lahore declaration both presidents confirmed their determination to comply with the  simla agreement
unfortunately the lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over kargil between may and july 
the latest development in kashmir is worrying
we condemn the continuing human rights violations the religious fanaticism the sabotage and the terrorism
india has repeatedly accused the government and islamabad of backing the guerrillas with technical and military knowhow
border crossings have to be prevented along a  km stretch of country which is hard to monitor
the political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks
we must work on achieving a rapprochement between the two neighbouring states the islamic state of pakistan and the multinational state of india
on the human rights situation in chechnya i have the following comments
we are still waiting for an answer from the russian authorities on these concrete proposals
the increasing pressure put on the independent media shows just how important those media are
the european commission has made great efforts to support the independent media in serbia
in december  we approved a eur  million programme of support
satellite equipment is being distributed across the region to croatia bosniaherzegovina and macedonia
this will only prolong the crisis in iraq
but let us be clear  the key to the lifting of sanctions lies with the iraqis
precisely because of this impasse and the high risks involved third parties must adopt a balanced approach
pakistan should be asked to put a stop to infiltration of paramilitary personnel crossing over from their side of the line of control
thank you very much commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  pm except on the situation in iraq as agreed
combatting organised crime
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr lavarra and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on the fight against organised crime
b by mr le pen and others on behalf of the technical group of independent members on organised crime
b by mr fitto and others on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats on organised crime
italians are familiar with the difficulties of dealing with organised crime
that is the first point which i wished to make here
the second is a political challenge which in my view we are not taking seriously enough
however the police counterstrategies needed still mainly come within the jurisdiction of the nation states
the instruments to fight organised crime are organised at intergovernmental level
where i live in the district of aachen there is a town called herzogenrath
however the events taking place in puglia and the south of italy are not at all romantic quite the opposite
the european union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former yugoslavia
europe is attempting to enlarge its borders and create an area of freedom security and justice
the adriatic is a border and so is the ionian sea
mr president when it comes to this issue i am in two minds
on the other hand however we must take care not to classify certain peoples in a particular manner
we are therefore against point  of the joint resolution which names montenegro
of course montenegro also has internal security problems as we do in the eu for that matter
we must be careful not to give him an excuse
clearly a lot of these criminal activities have serious negative consequences for the community and its member states
the tangible result has been the conclusion by the council in  of the preaccession pact on cooperation against crime with the candidate countries
these groups work to combat organised crime whose transnational dimension has been demonstrated on several occasions
the results of the activities of these task groups recorded over the last few years are particularly significant
in  for instance cigarette smuggling mainly in the transit regime totalled ecu  m
all in all we take these threats to the community very seriously and will continue working hard to fight them
thank you very much commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  pm
cites
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
mr president first of all i would like to apologise on behalf of mrs maijweggen who submitted this resolution
she has had to leave earlier on account of a death and funeral in the family
it is not the first time in this house that the cites convention is being mentioned
over the years this convention with its  signatories has saved many plants and animals threatened with extinction
in this intervention i would like to focus on three risks
we urge the commission and member states not to go along with this
the list of illegally traced ivory is already so extensive that a legal hunt would only exacerbate the problem
relegalisation would only further reward bad behaviour
in addition this minke whale is an endangered species and it would be preferable to keep to the arrangement to protect all whales
finally i would like to give a third example cuba has requested to move the hawksbill turtle back to appendix ii
this is the result of a typically isolated view of an animal generally threatened with extinction
this would be a tremendous incentive to continuing the illegal hunt
in a nutshell these are three examples from a series of proposals in nairobi which cause us great concern
we urge the commission and member states not to support this type of proposal but to keep cites as it is
i want to refer briefly to three essential measures which ought to be taken in nairobi in the days ahead
the first is providing information and raising awareness amongst the public the buyers and sellers
mr president protecting animal and plant species which are threatened with extinction is about more than just preserving the natural riches
it is about a battle between civilisation and barbarism
since the individual species are unable to stand up for themselves we need to do this for them at home or elsewhere
overexploitation and misuse cannot be explained by poverty alone they often involve ruthless traders who only have their own selfinterests at heart
although we may not be aware of it huge numbers of animals are also the victims of natural disasters and especially wars in africa
animals are by definition not just there for our amusement
it is only right that a civilised society should give their beastly fate more attention
fourteen eu ministers faintheartedly abstained from the vote and as a result legalised the shooting of elephants in africa
the dutch minister was the only one to vote for the conservation of the elephant
between  and  april next the fate of this elephant will once again feature on the agenda of the world community
south africa botswana namibia and zambia want to shoot even more elephants now
this blood money also ends up in the wrong hands
this is scandalous
mr president the european community is not a party to cites
the present text of the convention permits only individual countries to join
the gaborone amendment to the cites text from  would allow us to become a party to the convention
this legislation is amongst the most thorough and comprehensive of its kind in the world
however our general orientation on the major issues is as follows
we should therefore oppose the japanese and norwegian proposals to restart the trade
we should not support any of the proposals that have been made
concerning the cuban seaturtle proposals the community should oppose the resumption of the regular annual trade in shells
finally on sharks there is cause for concern and the proposal on basking sharks should in particular be supported
thank you very much commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  pm
mr president i see from my order paper that the vote on the situation in iraq has been withdrawn
can i be told at whose request and what reasons were given for withdrawing that
perhaps mr swoboda can briefly explain what is behind this
mr president you are quite right we have withdrawn the motions for resolutions
that was our reason for withdrawing them
mr president may i confirm that what mr swoboda just said applies equally to the epped group
we have withdrawn our motion for a resolution for the same reasons ie the debate scheduled for april
thank you mrs grossetete i think the reasons are now clear
mr buttiglione wishes to raise a point of order
thank you mr buttiglione
we shall now proceed to the vote
vote continuation
mr president although it would have been better if we had voted at lunchtime i am happy to go ahead now
mr president i support the proposal by my friend the very honourable member baroness ludford with pleasure
let us proceed with the vote
mr president i should just like to ask why the sudden change of mind by the members
mr posselt i suggest that you ask them yourselves later
i do not want a public debate in plenary on the matter
before the vote on amendment 
mr president on behalf of the guengl group i wish to withdraw amendments  and  relating to paragraph  of the report
i am against ethnic classifications because that would stigmatise immigrants
amendments  and  called for the term ethnic to be deleted
those are the reasons why i decided to withdraw these two amendments
thank you
we have noted your remarks
mr president i am grateful to mr sylla for withdrawing these two amendments
the mover of the motion had the foresight to withdraw the motion before the vote
we are not therefore voting on it
parliament approved the motion for a resolution
i would ask for this to be considered
mr president i freely admit that i have room for improvement
mr swoboda that applies to both of us
mr president on a point of order i am very pleased that this report has gone through
we spent a very long time voting on this
we could have done it much more quickly because the position has been quite clear
you have touched on a fundamental problem which has to do with the way in which this has been entered on the agenda
if according to the agenda these proposed amendments have been submitted in time then the president will call them and deal with them as usual
mr speroni wishes to raise a point of order
i am certain it was a problem of translation
i am convinced of it
parliament approved the motion for a resolution
report a by mrs read on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy on europe  an information society for all commission initiative com  c  cos for the special european council in lisbon on  march 
parliament approved the motion for a resolution
most of our group therefore abstained or voted against
our reasons were as follows
thirdly the ludford report addresses matters which lie outside the time framework of the report and have nothing whatsoever to do with the report
i consider that unacceptable
my group has therefore been compelled either to abstain or to vote against the report
applause
yet we certainly do not go along with the way parliament is congratulating itself
first of all because most of the proposals to promote the rights of minorities and immigrants remain vague and are not binding
that obviously violates the treaty right away
it is badly drafted
and i could give further examples of this kind of thing to justify our abstention
mr president i should like to give a very brief explanation on behalf of the austrian delegation of socialists
we abstained on point 
we would have preferred a statement in keeping with the european parliament s resolution on austria
but as this point was accepted nonetheless we voted in favour of the report on account of its fundamentally positive thrust
i do not think this kind of resolution does any credit to our parliament
the fight against the racists and xenophobes in our society those who seek to divide europe is one that must and will be won

i think the approach taken in these reports is a kind of violation of our terms of reference
the two reports also join forces in calling for the right of immigrants to vote and stand for election in local and european elections
i think that second category is highly significant
and of course they insist that in future this document must be legally binding on the member states
recent events in austria demonstrate that it is alas still necessary today to combat racism antisemitism and xenophobia
for there is indeed a strong risk that people will simply become used to the situation
i repeat the great risk is that it will become part of everyday life
throughout europe extreme rightwing parties are hoping to exploit the entry into power of this coalition with its fascist connotations
i personally am prepared to take this fight to the bitter end
one other proposal deserves our full attention
in writing
for those reasons our vote is in favour of the report
this requires a careful mixture firstly of education and only when absolutely necessary of legislation
this report totally fails to provide a balanced approach
it is damaging through its stridency
it gives no credit for the great achievements in race relations in eu states
it offers only a defeatist agenda not one of a positive nature
it insults those who are trying to improve a situation and therefore it is offensive to many
those of us who really care know the great difficulties of this subject
this report would undermine rather than improve race relations that cannot be a desirable outcome
but this report will at least have the merit thanks to the baroness and her cronies of letting us find out who the new collaborators are
stand up and be counted
 fr europe is facing real difficulties today
like it or not it is not the path of glory it aspired to be for the citizens of the member states
that could have allowed us to inject a little soul into a system sadly in need of it
but that was not to be
the human being has a dignity a mission that are far superior if not contrary to what is being put before us today
 fr today the european parliament is presenting us with the new man in a new world
oh how wonderful it must be to live in china in cuba or in north korea
this is not serious
communities whether national or european need points of reference that are not exclusive but that guarantee enduring relations
today the ludford report puts us at a remove from that europe
report a by mr belder
however that vote does not mean we agree with all the recitals and all the proposals in it
all this creates fertile ground for the rise in forms of racism
the report highlights one very acute problem in the candidate countries the problem of respect for the rights of minorities
i am thinking particularly of the roma who face intolerable discrimination in several central and eastern european countries
i am also thinking obviously of the problem of the institutionalised discrimination against the kurdish people
so far all the pressure exerted by the european parliament has had no effect on the turkish authorities position
sadly mrs zana s case is no exception
turkey needs to make considerable progress in relation to respect for the kurdish population
that is the condition for its accession to the european union and there can be no compromise on that
ecb foreign reserve assets
mr president ladies and gentlemen the european union has equipped itself with a politically independent central bank responsible for safeguarding price stability
the ecb must at the very least be financially independent
of that  are in gold while the remaining  consist of us dollars and yen
it should be noted that interest on its own capital is the european central bank s only reliable source of income
in the short term this income varies with interest rates
the ecb s other source of income is the interest on its official reserves
however from that income the ecb has to deduct the interest it pays on its liabilities in euros visavis the national central banks
an internal ecb calculation indicates that the foreign exchange value at risk could exceed the ecb s current capital
the treaty provides for a mechanism whereby the ecb can forearm itself against any erosion of its capital
the european central bank can partially or totally retain the monetary income from the eurosystem
nevertheless a central bank that depended on being bailed out repeatedly would not be very credible
in fact the european central bank will probably close its  financial year with a deficit of more than eur  million
so it is imperative to resolve this structural problem as quickly as possible
in this context it must be noted that the total reserves of the eurosystem come to more than eur  billion
i have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues
in this case it is a question of saying yes or no
a massive yes vote also sends out a political message
we want the ecb to be able to pursue its main objective of safeguarding price stability in total independence  including material independence
the central bank has everything to gain from this improved transparency with regard to consolidating its credibility
so its role is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets
what is the legal basis for today s debate
this call must be issued in the form of a regulation by the eu council
the ecb is currently calling for a further increase of  billion euros
the reasons are set out in detail and time is already marching on but allow me to say that we consider that this increase is needed
we know that it sustained a loss in 
we must therefore admit that a lack of funds robs the ecb of the ability to formulate an independent and transparent policy
its financing requirements must be covered so that its independence cannot be called into question
secondly we are in favour of this increase because it will help to foster the credibility of the ecb on the markets
thirdly this increase will enhance the ability of the ecb to react and adapt
it gives it the possibility to react more flexibly because it has the necessary funds at its disposal
the following reasons are given first the treaty makes provision for this
if it is not applied in the form of a regulation this could be construed as a difference of opinion between the ecb and the council
secondly the ecb should gain in financial independence
thirdly the foreign exchange intervention instrument will be made more credible and the capacity of the ecb to adjust to various scenarios will be fostered
of course there can be no objection to any structural improvement of the ecb s financial situation
the only question is whether or not pouring more money into it will solve the problem once and for all
before an answer can be given the following questions at least must be considered
firstly does it make political and economic sense to apply the sort of restrictive monetary policy which the ecb applies and which is more restrictive than the fed
sixthly what specific grounds are there for assuming that the ecb will probably sustain a loss in 
mr president the european central bank is recommending to the council that it double its foreign reserve assets
to that end it puts forward two very different kinds of argument
in a flash of lucidity the ecb has declared that a central bank with a structural deficit would quite simply not be credible
that is true and it gives some cause for anxiety about the administrative ability of those who so quickly need to raise the ceiling level
no really we care little whether the ecb does or does not double its nuisance value
that is reason enough for us to vote against this text
why
they all seem to be becoming rather more realistic again now
yet it is a revealing slip of the pen
mr president on behalf of my colleague mr solbes i would like to make the following comments
the commission has therefore adopted a favourable opinion on the ecb s recommendation
thank you commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
we cannot afford for the european union to make a bad impression again
we take note of your comments mr zimmerling
this was an unfair comment
no one could by the wildest stretch of the imagination consider someone like emma bonino a racist
people need to be extremely careful how they treat other people in this chamber
some people may not like the fact that the technical group has been set up but it has been
people have rights and i do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable
we take note of your comments mrs mckenna
very well mr seppanen we also take note of your comments
i would ask that my attendance be recorded in yesterday s minutes
that will not be a problem
mr president i do not have any comment to make on the minutes but i do want to say something about the european parliament s information services
i do not know whether i have picked the right moment to say this
it does not concern the minutes but relates to something else
can i go ahead
i would ask the parliamentary services to look into why it was left out
i can assure you that the services will look into this very closely mr poettering
i conclude this from the minutes
very well mr manders we take note of all of that
the minutes were approved
vote
whether national or european any central bank exclusively serves the interests of big investors
our abstention expresses our opposition to both the national and the european organisation of the banking system
 fr the european central bank s proposal induces us to reflect and to act prudently on two counts
it seems legitimate to ask ourselves whether we are throwing funds down a bottomless pit
consequently another question arises regarding the effective use of financial resources
in conclusion let us remember that a state is not defined in terms of the sovereignty it enjoys as a result of its autonomy of action
cap information measures
they avoid dealing with the cap in a passive purely bureaucratic and technological fashion
that is why we believe that parliament s amendments improve the text
in our opinion these are proposals that should promote rural development and improve food safety and product quality
mr president that is all i have to say
i would also like the european commission in one way or another to take account of parliament s criteria
if this work is to succeed it is important that cooperation should be established with the farming organisations and also with consumers
this means that the eu s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all eu citizens
the common agricultural policy is always undergoing change and development
it demands a great deal in terms of the supply of information and especially in terms of the coordination which is needed if cooperation is to succeed both within the member states and independently of the member states
hence the importance of our amendment designed to supplement the concept set out in the report
we hope that this amendment will be adopted
mr president i welcome this measure
from an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing
but when we come to think about it the amount of money is quite small  eur  million over a period of six years
the common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism
the commission taught member states over the years how to be open with very limited resources
these have to be explained not only to farmers but to consumers as well
there is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe
it is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this
the last point i want to make is that arising from these pressures we will have a reaction from agriculture
to devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy
in this way the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated
now i would like to speak about parliament s proposed amendments
they are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals
amendments nos  and  concern organisations falling within the scope of aid it is the opinion of the commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name
all agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to article 
this being the case the proposed addenda are unnecessary
amendments nos   and  concern measures that are eligible for aid
they are unnecessary as they are already contained in the commission s proposal
one of them which reads supporting them in their choices is not in harmony with the commission s proposal
the purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services
local bodies are better qualified to do that
the resources available would not be sufficient for that either
i would moreover like to make the comment with regard to the amendments tabled for article  that information visits are not being ruled out
the list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive which is indicated in the word particularly 
the commission is prepared however to adopt this amendment
amendment no  concerns article 
that is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail
amendments nos  and  concern contributions
the commission thinks that it is not desirable to pay more than  of eligible aid costs
the funds available are modest
the lower the contribution stays the more measures there will be that can be financed and the greater the multiple effect
amendments nos  and  concern the allocation and approval of appropriations
as we know parliament is a budgetary authority together with the council
for this reason the commission thinks amendment no  is not necessary
amendment no  concerns evaluation
the commission agrees with parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation
it can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation
amendment no  concerns administration
this extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation in the opinion of the commission
provision for administrative details evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the commission in the implementing regulation
amendments nos  and  concern linguistic nuances
these the commission does not consider significant as recitals  and  in the commission s proposal are not as restrictive
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
grain legumes
the european parliament has been analysing this proposal since october  and approved this draft legislative resolution unanimously on  february 
i would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the european parliament
first amendment no  on the inclusion of a recital a
secondly parliament s amendment no  proposes that seed vetches should also be included in the aid system
aid for seeds already exists for rice chickpeas and lentils
thirdly amendment no  indicates that in our opinion the commission should without further delay make proposals for the  period
however this has still not been done
secondly successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system
the maximum guaranteed area is being systematically reduced thus penalising time and again the farmers who are suffering reductions in aid of up to 
therefore mr president what the committee on agriculture and rural development of the european parliament would really like to see is an improvement in the system
thanks also to the commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and i hope it will be open to our proposals
the only new element is the substitution of the management committee by the cereal management committee
the purchase of dried pulses in spain has been increasing by up to  annually
another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming
i would also recall the fact that the commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain
wheat growers in particular will be affected very badly which they already are because of a  fall in prices but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops
mr president i would again like to thank the rapporteur maria izquierdo rojo for an excellent and constructive report
there are two commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes
what vegetables are we actually talking about
lentils and chickpeas serve as food for humans while the seeds of vetches which to us are more unusual vegetables are used as animal feed
grain legumes are covered by their own scheme where the amount of fixed aid per hectare is eur  and the maximum guaranteed area is   hectares
the special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain growing areas by means of the aid per hectare arrangement
what are the conclusions of the commission s report
an examination of how the scheme has been applied reveals that the mga of   hectares has been systematically exceeded
there are two conclusions to be drawn from this
first the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and second the growing areas have to be brought under better control
so how could the system be improved
we should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it
we are in a situation in which the agenda  reform has been adopted and international trade negotiations are drawing closer
this is a reference to amendment no 
the other reason is that it might involve extra expense
in addition it is proposed that the management committee for dried fodder be replaced by the management committee for cereals
the purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
additionality
the next item is the debate on the following oral questions to the commission
b by mrs evans and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance on additionality
eur  billion of european funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended
the money will be taken from other budgets in the national assembly such as health and education
therefore central government expenditure is reduced
yet when the commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a member state level
this is a clear contradiction
the rules as they stand allow this to happen
member states are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level
in this way european union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities
the exante verification of additionality is at present being undertaken in application of article  of regulation 
where necessary the commission may request clarification from the member states on the details of their forecasts for eligible expenditure for the period 
the second issue covered by the questions is the possibility of the verification of additionality at regional level
i would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers
there are two major news stories breaking in the united kingdom today
now these stories are not just topical background to this debate
as a direct result of what i would describe as uk government policy our agricultural economy has all but collapsed
i turn then to the central hand of labour government at work in terms of the european structural funds package
i am rather sorry that the regional policy committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves but there it is
there are a number of questions that i would ask commissioner liikanen to take back to commissioner barnier
what progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the commission
so will the commission undertake to make that information available to all members of the european parliament
will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters
mr president i should just like to touch on a couple of points that mr evans raised
first of all i acknowledge that there is difficulty in the midlands with the rover group
i would not like to make political capital out of it
there are too many jobs at stake
secondly he also mentioned their byelection
i congratulate his party in securing a victory in this byelection
but unlike him i have been in ayr for the last three weeks on the doorstep
i can tell you that additionality was never raised once
i turn to the question at hand
i thank the nationalists for having raised this
it is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the structural funds
but i suspect there is a deeper plot here
what are they actually trying to achieve
i listened to ms evans
basically what i took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the structural funds regulations
is it therefore parliament s role now to change that
we should not change that
the role of this parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with
that is what we should concentrate on
i should like to read out the statement made by commissioner barnier after that meeting
i know that there has been a great deal of debate in scotland and wales recently about european regional funding
but i have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues  additionality and cofinancing
i am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the nationalists on this
we have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met 
such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds
at the very least this engenders a lack of transparency
it may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a regionbyregion basis
our task is to ensure that following on from this the commission s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives
we therefore call on the commission to
the president cut the speaker off
even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the european union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor
the money is actually transferred and regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not the countries become the better off

we are now into to the third or fourth programme
but from  to  the public capital programme actually reduced including structural funds
it reduced in real terms by 
so where did the structural funds go
mr president i am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed
i am referring to the report by the court of auditors on the principle of additionality
this is a report that was published in the official journal of the european communities on  march
this report contains a very interesting section  section   that discusses privatisation
and the response given to us by the commission in section  is very short
that is the commission is replying using the olendorf method
the second issue is that the berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the structural funds
taking into account inflation i can calculate that there is a reduction of 
i suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the member states
that is simply unacceptable
difficult indeed sir
i think we must look in detail at that problem and we need also better coordination between dgs on this issue
additionality is your concept and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in member states
we understand as well of course the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes creating problems of continuity for you
verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with member states because they are guilty as well
one of the worst offenders in this connection is the uk
no additional money has been built into the budget of our welsh assembly
this is clear noncompliance
it is all very well for my colleague jonathan evans to imply that his party is not guilty
for eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either
i think some momentum is being lost mr president
i was talking to councils in wales yesterday
they need this scheme to go ahead
we pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive
we have no objective  funding
so why do i speak
because even in the southeast of england there are pockets of deprivation
it gets no support from europe
why not
it does not get the grant from europe because at nuts ii it is classified with hampshire
hampshire is a prosperous county   of european average so no money for the isle of wight
i think they might win that case
he has recommended that the commission and eurostat should look again at this particular problem
 mr president tony blair and donald dewar will not have slept well last night
their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality
the labour party heartlands of scotland have sent them an unmistakable message
the scottish labour voter  for so long taken for granted  has spoken
commissioner three questions
that is not very satisfactory from the point of view of the many members of this house who made important points
i request that mr barnier gives a written summary of his response to these points
i am sure that commissioner barnier will be willing to follow up on this interesting debate
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on  april
adjournment of the session
ladies and gentlemen i wish you a good weekend and i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
the sitting was closed at  am
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday  march 
statement by the president
ladies and gentlemen as you know on tuesday a terrible accident took place in kitzsteinhorn near salzburg
eleven people were killed in an avalanche and that is not the final death toll
it may be worse yet
the next few hours will tell
i should like to correct it because the meaning has been distorted
it should read will never distance 
firstly the existence of a blacklist of members of parliament and representatives of ngos whom the turkish government deems undesirable
in addition to this there has been a marked return to suppression of journalistic activities which has been documented in a report by other sources as well
we feel that these actions taken by turkey against members of parliament are cause for very serious concern
i would like the turkish government to be asked to clarify whether blacklists also exist for european countries other than italy
thank you mrs morgantini
we shall of course look into the matter thoroughly
madam president i am rising to speak about what has just been said by mrs morgantini
yesterday tuesday morning mr birdal went to prison to serve the sentence that the turkish courts have imposed on him
thank you mr galeote quecedo
of course we all remember the very moving debate we had right here on the subject
we can assure the journalist in question of this institution s complete solidarity and opposition to this truly disgraceful act of terrorism
something quite astonishing for this type of meeting occurred
everyone was quite dumbfounded by this attitude
it is imperative to restore good relations and we therefore deplore this incident most strongly
madam president i should like you to ask the canadian government for some explanation of the significance of these declarations
of course mr berthu
this is certainly a quite regrettable incident
madam president  april will see the start of the trial in iran of thirteen iranian citizens who are of the jewish religion
mr tajani you are quite right
i did approach the iranian government but received no response
you can count on me therefore to try again
tomorrow s agenda includes the topic of human cloning
i should also mention an interest of my own since i am a professor of the university on unpaid leave of absence from that institution which is also involved
ladies and gentlemen i should like to get on with the items on the agenda
i do not think that all these contributions are genuine points of order
we do still have two of them though
madam president i shall be very brief
we share mr galeote quecedo s disapproval of the displays of politically motivated violence in the basque country
the murderers of the basque country are not inspired by the doctrine of benito mussolini but by marxism
these are the extreme leftwing ideas represented in this house
unless we therefore consider that they benefit
the president cut the speaker off
let us see if mr katiforis contribution is a genuine point of order
madam president i would simply like to follow up what mrs morgantini said about the lists in turkey
naturally i imagine he must mean any country that does not belong to the european union 
the president cut the speaker off
mr katiforis we shall look into it thank you
welcome
indeed it was our former fellow member mrs ewing whom i must welcome more particularly who opened the first sitting of the scottish parliament
applause
agenda
the next item is the order of business
relating to wednesday
are there any objections to this request
there do not seem to be any objections
in that case this will be the arrangement
mr gollnisch spoke to object and to request that this be put to the vote
mr gollnisch i take note of your contribution and we shall of course put the matter to the vote
it is your right as a member of parliament
i shall therefore put to the vote the request to bring forward the debate on hushkits
parliament gave its assent
are there any objections
mr gollnisch spoke to request that this be put to the vote we shall put the request made by the group of the greenseuropean free alliance to the vote
parliament gave its assent
relating to thursday
i shall give the floor to mr watson who is the chairman of this committee
we will hear statements by the commission and council presidency tomorrow on the interception of communications
the item is on the agenda of our next committee meeting
madam president i should like to speak in support of this motion
there do not seem to be any objections
parliament gave its assent
general product safety  bse tests
the next item is the commission statement on general product safety
the first one as you mentioned relates to the proposals on the amendment of the directive on general product safety
the idea behind the directive is in fact quite simple
we have undertaken an extensive stocktaking exercise on the implementation of the present directive
the report on the main findings will be circulated in parallel to the draft revision of the directive
while the general approach of the directive is sound experience has revealed certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct
we first wish to clarify the scope of the directive
this directive is meant to provide consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers
however it does not apply where a specific sector of legislation covers the same aspects under consideration
we want to make sure that the directive gives the best coverage possible to products used by consumers
two examples of that would be hairdryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre
we want to have a more efficient system
this implies therefore additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information
this is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions
the present situation is in fact far from ideal
this notification is compulsory in the united states but not so far in the european union
this particular provision is designed to rectify that situation
i also want a reinforcement of the market surveillance by member states
as you know there is no good law if it is not applied properly
member states now will be required to strengthen the tasks of the surveillance authorities
the practical operation of the system will be improved
we now also foresee the possibility of opening the system to third countries in particular candidate countries
i will mention here that we have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at community level
another point to which i wish to draw your attention is improved transparency
consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening
is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved
secondly could i ask about the process whereby dangerous products or products that are deemed to be dangerous are removed from the market
flammable furniture would be a case i have in mind
is there going to be a widening of the area of scrutiny which will take into account products of this sort
thank you mr whitehead for those words of support which i greatly welcome
let me say in relation to your question on candidate countries that there is an ongoing discussion in relation to this issue
issues such as this particular provision will also be the focus of our attention
thirdly i am aware of your concern in relation to flammable furniture and other items and these are being kept under review
commissioner you have just made the very important point that consumers should be able to be confident
would you be in favour of establishing a forum of this kind
i can confirm that there are a number of proposals in the pipeline in relation to the very issue that you draw attention to
so i can assure you mrs auroi that i am concerned about these issues
i take that responsibility seriously and we will be moving along in this way
has this been agreed with the trade unions and employers federations
i have said on a number of occasions including in this parliament that the primary consideration must be the protection of the public
that is not to say that the considerations that you draw attention to should be ignored
madam president commissioner i wish to congratulate the commission on this initiative which i believe to be extremely important
why not start by changing our agricultural policy so that it inspires complete confidence in consumers
madam president i too would like to say how much the commission s statements today have pleased me
i am acutely aware of this issue and therefore i fully agree with the import of your question
madam president commissioner food safety product safety  i should like to dwell on this aspect
we know that meat production begins in the stall
the talk at present is of a total declaration of feedingstuffs
we have also seen that the feedingstuffs industry has gone straight on to the defensive because they say that what is being asked of them here is unrealistic
there is a body of legislation in place that deals with animal feed and in the white paper this issue is also addressed
there are legislative provisions in the annex to the document which indicate the commission s intentions in relation to animal feed
i would like to ask the commissioner a specific question about the rapid alert system
is the commissioner able to provide assurances that these new proposals will overcome this problem
you are perfectly correct in what you say about the provision of information by the belgian authorities in respect of the dioxin issue
it was of such concern to the commission that proceedings were instituted by the commission against belgium in the court of justice
the tests offer new opportunities to test a large number of animals on a routine basis
i am also happy to be able to tell parliament that these particular tests will produce a result within  hours
we propose to test a minimum number of   animals per year in the whole community and the testing will start in january 
i commend these proposals to parliament which have been put through the commission this afternoon
madam president commissioner it will come as no surprise to you that i am not satisfied
i have quite a few questions
parliament has been calling for the bse test to be made compulsory since the bse control committee
it may very well be that it can happen in a shorter space of time
tests will have to be available to ensure that the systems that are put in place are monitored and working properly
but if member states are in a position to do that earlier so be it and so much the better
mr president commissioner you have already partially answered the first question on samples
i have a second question for you
my second point commissioner regards application in 
control would then be much tighter in the production sector thus benefiting the consumer
we know that there is a proposal there already and that will now be fasttracked
you have just said that public health takes priority over employment and economic considerations
so all these factors must be looked at together
there is a multilayered response there are many issues involved and i have indicated a number of them to you this afternoon
mr president commissioner i share all the concerns expressed by previous speakers
my question to you commissioner is this so far thank god austria has not had a single case of bse
will these tests also be carried out in austria
yes these tests will be carried out in every member state including austria
you mr whitehead are particularly familiar with these
but i regret i am not in a position to read the mind of the svc
that has tended to concentrate minds very considerably
i have just a minor question to add to what mr daul and mrs lienemann have already said what is to be done
would it not be sensible also to eliminate the animals taken to the abattoir at the last minute which are often likely to be infected
surely it is better to take them out of the food chain
my understanding is that those animals are normally taken out of the food chain
the findings of the report make extremely alarming reading
this must be an issue of great concern to the commissioner
i raised this with the french agriculture minister mr glavany when he came to brussels last week
he rejected out of hand the conclusions of the food and veterinary office report and the findings of the inspectors
i would like to know what the commission is doing about this
could i therefore ask mr byrne what he is doing about this report
i am satisfied that the french authorities have taken action
aeroplane hushkits
the next item is the joint debate on two oral questions to the commission by the following members
mr hatzidakis on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on hushkitted aircraft b
mr president i look forward with great interest to the commissioner s reply to this debate
this is of course a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a united states election year
we can understand that american politicians have little room for manoeuvre
the first compromise put forward a little time ago seemed to many in the parliament to be much too shaky
or would they
the danger it seemed to us was that the european union would have been left with absolutely nothing
as is clear the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public
at the same time however it seems that the regulation affects the interests of the american aircraft industry
to show good faith the council and parliament postponed the regulation s entry into force by one year
as we know mrs de palacio was authorised by the council of ministers to negotiate with the us
i have no doubt that aside from being lengthy those talks were also difficult
however as they themselves would say they must understand that it takes two to tango 
our position then is as follows
secondly if there is no agreement then it is clear that the european union will have to act unilaterally
if good faith prevails that agreement can become a reality
in that sense i cannot understand the insistence of the us who continually talk about the suspension of our own regulation
mr president i want to conclude with two respective observations
the first is this it must be made clear who is negotiating on the us side
we know who our negotiator is it is mrs de palacio and to date she has proved a very good negotiator
it is now a powerful body
with these thoughts therefore i would like to ask the commissioner and the council what their positions are
mr president ladies and gentlemen one thing is crystal clear on  may the hushkits regulation enters into force in the european union
that is all we know for sure
from then on we will have to see how we can carry on negotiating with the united states
this regulation has no further intention but i believe we need to be more ambitious
the current standards as mr blokland has reminded us date from 
since then world aeronautical technology has made great advances
it is therefore a question of achieving new noise levels as international standards within the icao
in this respect we need to cooperate with the americans who after all are our friends and allies
what can we negotiate
we can negotiate two things
i have negotiated with many people from the united states administration
i have kept you informed promptly and with complete transparency throughout all this time
agreement could conceivably be reached on the basic ideas which i presented to him and we will continue to work on it
i hope that between us all we can reach this agreement
there is much ado about a great deal
that is something which many of us here wish to bear in mind which is why we tabled this legislation
that is the only reason
i welcome that and i congratulate you
basically it has nothing to discuss unless it wants to submit new legislation to us which is obviously not the case
that is the part which is due to enter into force in april 
we must be clear and united on where we want to go and what the ultimate goal is
i am not haggling over six months but i do want clear objectives and we must have a clear timetable
if it goes through in september of next year then we still have enough time to suspend the regulation
i am not prepared to consider a suspension without the conditions which i have just formulated
i think that is a particularly sorry state of affairs
that much is clear
they have not given us their commitment that is what makes us so suspicious
they have given it to us so often
on so many occasions they have half committed themselves and then backed off again and so on and so forth
as far as i am concerned it is clear that the suspicion derives from the americans lack of willingness to commit themselves to something that is inevitable
only when they actually sign on the dotted line to this effect will we in the union be able to help to move the situation on
we should not turn things round
yesterday we had a talk with the american minister for transport
and so i think that it is time for a clear signal but it must come from them in the first instance
it is not acceptable for them to ask us to defer our own regulations
their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer
the complaint they have filed with the icao is in fact uncalledfor blackmail
i believe they should withdraw it
mr hatzidakis has said that it should be withdrawn and you have said that we should defer
i have tabled an amendment to the effect that they should definitely withdraw the complaint
i think we need to word what we currently have on paper a little more strongly
mr president in my opinion commissioner palacio is completely right to uphold the european position against the united states
this is not the first time that our positions laws and regulations have differed from those of the united states
consider the example of genetically modified organisms
if we want to maintain our sovereignty we must do so in every area including this one
it does not matter whether this is achieved through the use of modified afterburners or other types of engine mufflers
i wonder if we should abolish this regulation as far as third country aircraft are concerned
it has not even entered into force
it is on the statute books but will not enter into force until may 
why should we abolish it
i think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year
this was also what my fellow member was asking
in this respect i think that mr slater should put his money where his mouth is as we say in hamburg
on that basis madam vicepresident you continue to have our full support
stand by your guns madam vicepresident
but i would advise that we wait for the first working results from the icao working party on noise protection regulations
but having said that it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion
i say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon congress in an election year
the commissioner and others have outlined the basis of possible discussions
mrs rothberendt has mentioned a target with which i will concur
mr president i strongly support the resolutions that are on the table before us
it is very clear that icao standards need to be seen as a floor not as a ceiling
it should be quite possible and right to go beyond them
hushkits are important but noise pollution is only one aspect of the environmental damage from the airline industry
we need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions
mr president i have problems with the genesis of regulation  of  to which the resolution before us refers
it was voted through the last parliament without any debate
it is contrary to the principle of nondiscrimination
yes mr president noise pollution affects  of our population and  comes from aircraft
i fully support the necessary standards to protect the health and quality of life for our citizens
environmental legislation based on design criteria i put it to you colleagues is without precedent and for good reason
i do not care whether it is america europe china or mars  worldwide is equitable
above all it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve
no there are thousands of residents living in the vicinity of airports who suffer considerable noise pollution
obviously this regulation offers them the best protection as things stand at present under current international legislation
american opinion will therefore only be shifted significantly in turn if we first make it known in our capacity as europeans
my regret is that this year s postponement may have been seen by our partners as indicative of weakness in our position
there are no grounds for suspending regulations
an overall framework does not mean evading the issue as i began to doubt upon hearing the views of the council
only under these circumstances could we accept a delay in our regulation for third countries
mr president the british delegate has just spoken using mr bowe s speaking time
i think mr blokland you could have done that without actually announcing it to parliament but never mind
there are regulations we put them in place
i was here at the first reading in the parliament in strasbourg
they are good regulations
there are going to be useful regulations and they are going to bring positive benefit to the people of europe
that does not mean though that you should not negotiate
i was fortunate to have an opportunity to talk with undersecretary slater yesterday along with a number of my other colleagues
your objective madame palacio is to get that worldwide effect
that is the mandate we are giving you here today
that is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future
in the meantime though enforce and implement the regulations as we expect them to be enforced and implemented
suggest that to them madame palacio
start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise
yesterday we discussed this matter and i received the full support of the council for which i would like to publicly express my gratitude
we must go further
the united states should not be the only country with which we cooperate but we certainly must cooperate with the united states and with the united states in particular
clearly the tensions and confrontations involving the hushkits issue hinder this type of action
we must therefore try to reach an agreement which will allow us to overcome the current situation of conflict
there is nothing more to say about this
the regulation comes into force for european airlines on  may
that is all thank you very much mr president
that concludes the joint debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow

bautista ojeda on behalf of the vertsale group to the council b
bautista ojeda on behalf of the vertsale group to the commission b
it is obvious to all of us that the euromediterranean partnership has to complement the european policy for the mediterranean basin


the first is a general consideration
this is a general political concern
the second point is more specific
in our view barcelona defined the major points of this policy but with the passage of time these have been lost from sight
this means that the pillars which were the basis for barcelona must be adopted and perhaps even reinforced
and this is a weak point
we agree to support the civil forum
the political signal which we must all send out together and the instruments which are decided upon must be capable of successfully relaunching this policy and restoring its status
i hope i have been clear
we feel very strongly about this issue
however the agenda must tackle the central issues and not skirt around them as it currently threatens to do
we are also concerned at the total lack of interest shown by the commission in reopening the debate
and yet much remains to be done in order to relaunch the three cooperation chapters decided upon in barcelona
political dialogue must be structured and take the form of regular consultations
this is extremely important for the mutual benefits are very great
our defensive strategy of enclosing ourselves in a single market and barricading ourselves in will ultimately prove to be a losing one
we cannot shirk the challenges thrown up by globalisation but have to learn how to approach and exploit them
the mediterranean is still the greatest benchmark of europe s capacity to exert influence beyond its borders
the need for a different more efficient mediterranean policy for the developing countries in the basin cannot be disregarded
therefore mr president much work still remains to be done
mr president this is a decisive moment for the future of the european union
despite the progress made at bilateral and multilateral levels the charter for stability and security is still awaiting completion
the partnership is still far from achieving its objectives
the forging of multilateral relations has not led to sustained expansion and the cultural social and human partnership is highly inadequate
by what means is the commission going to make the meda programme more efficient
what are the specific actions that the commission intends to adopt to create a genuine cultural social and human partnership
mr president on behalf of my colleague chris patten i have the following comments
the text of the charter for peace and stability should be agreed at the meeting in midnovember
it should be as meaningful and farreaching as possible
i should like to see regular security and stability discussions open to all partners willing to participate
i also want to see an enhanced human rights dimension in the partnership
all programmes contain conditionalities ensuring that their social impact is taken into account
these will enable us to focus on the key objectives of the partnership and will also improve the disbursement rate on meda
the implementation of meda has been subject to criticism some justified some not
it is a young programme with specific objectives linked to the implementation of free trade with the partners
often the final beneficiaries are not the partner governments this has in itself increased the complexity of implementation
i count on the parliament to support our efforts
investment is a major issue which was addressed at the important conference held in lisbon on  february and  march
we shall use meda to support the partners efforts in this respect
regional cooperation to ensure that the region presents a unified market is also vital
subregional free trade areas should be supported as a step towards the global objective
regional infrastructure is essential to economic development
meda supports among other things the interconnection of infrastructure as regards energy transport and new technology
investments in these areas are primarily supported by loans from the european investment bank as well as other donors
support for civil society is key to the development of the human dimension of the partnership
i will consider what more we can do while respecting the need for sound financial management
for some reason or other these agreements have not been implemented
mr president in november five years will have passed since the signing of the barcelona declaration
the moment has therefore arrived to make an assessment of the euromediterranean policy an assessment of the results achieved and also of this policy s delays and shortcomings
in this respect this debate and the motions for resolutions tabled by the groups in this parliament are very appropriate initiatives
this assessment certainly includes some positive aspects
firstly there has been no decisive political thrust when we really needed it
on the other hand there is no certainty whatsoever when it comes to the future of the mediterranean
this is an illustration of what could be described as the strategic blindness of the european system as a whole
thank you very much mr obiols
i have allowed you the extra minute since you are chairman of the maghreb delegation
on the other hand we know that certain obstacles basically political ones have hindered its correct application
let me take tunisia as an example one of the first countries with which we signed a partnership agreement
the situation of the rule of law and human rights in this country is scandalous
right now there are people held there as prisoners of conscience
who is entitled to travel and to make use of the mediterranean area
not the opponents of the regime
it is not enough to have a healthy economic balance sheet
it is not enough to achieve good results in agriculture or anything else
respect for human rights must take precedence in our policy and that is not the case at present
it is not the case and it is something we have to change and that means parliament as well as the commission or the council
mr president the euromediterranean partnership launched in  has broken down it is official
let me say from the outset that the time has come to change the course of euromediterranean policy
poverty a high level of illiteracy massive unemployment particularly among young people extreme inequalities and an increasing technological deficit compared to western countries
there are considerable infrastructure needs not to mention environmental challenges
the effect of this widening gap can only be to increasingly foster the most violent forms of nationalism fundamentalism and war
the prospect of a free trade area a sort of regional mai is liable to dangerously exacerbate these power struggles
studies show that two thirds of tunisian industry would not survive the opening of frontiers
there are however advantages to establishing things from scratch
there are many possible ways out of the dogma of free trade that was challenged in seattle
the credibility of european foreign policy is at stake here
i think the inclusion of libya is crucial
libya in particular has a great deal of catching up to do in telecommunications now that the embargo has been lifted
this will certainly be in the interest of both sides
i hope that this parliament will support it
i believe furthermore that the commission must have sufficient human and material resources to do so
the second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of immigration in the regulation
i am concerned about how this issue will be dealt with in the mediterranean area
the mediterranean and its peoples need us
we cannot leave them to struggle alone
the regulation must be amended and commission staff must be increased
we shall have proposals to present to parliament to this effect in order to ensure better examination of the files
next  of the appropriations are reserved for bilateral cooperation but only  for regional cooperation which is of great interest to us
this must be increased decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and the participation of civilian societies must be utilised
secondly this programme does not focus solely on economic matters and free trade
the president cut the speaker off
i think that we can learn something from the concerns expressed on all sides
secondly in my opinion there is a lack of generosity
the third point is that in my opinion the european union has no autonomy
we see this in the middle east visavis the usa and on a broader scale too
from lisbon in  to cannes in  and especially in barcelona that same year there have always been requests for a strong euromediterranean partnership to be established
the european union and twelve mediterranean countries were consequently pleased to adopt the famous barcelona declaration in 
this declaration had particularly great ambitions in economic and financial political and security social cultural and human terms
generally moreover the technical problems the political problems the limited direct investment the inordinate debt of our partners are plain for all to see and to deplore
as a socialist i therefore support the substance of the proposals included in our joint resolution
this visit has been an exceptional demonstration of the understanding that can be achieved between all parties
my feeling on the occasion of this debate is that it is worth paying tribute to the actions of this great man of peace this indefatigable pilgrim
this approach is supposed to be global and regional and treats the mediterranean basin as a regional entity
it is reasonable to think that cooperation between the mediterranean states should be much stronger
the second question concerns the role of the european parliament and it must be noted that at present it is too limited
so as i pointed out the union s mediterranean policy is supposed to be global
the european parliament is in fact only consulted on the occasion of bilateral agreements
it is essential that we strengthen political economic and social ties and continue to move forward
we now have an association agreement with morocco in force since  march which makes that country a privileged partner
i would like to mention the fisheries agreement between the european community and morocco which expired on  november last year
well four months later we are in a vacuum
we still have no date for a start to negotiations
the commission should fulfil its duty and ensure that these negotiations finally begin
as has been said a delegation from this parliament has just visited morocco and tunisia
as a result we have been asked to ensure that the union has a greater political involvement in the mediterranean
it would be good if the representatives of the commission and the council present here today could answer this question
this is not an easy task and only dialogue and not confrontation can achieve it
european union actions are still very diffuse and complex in this area
mr president i did not want to speak earlier in order not to interfere in the debate
the previous president has clearly discriminated in favour of other meps who have been allowed to speak longer than they should have done
once we take our places all meps are equal and all of us have to respect the rules
mr bautista ojeda your comments will be recorded in the minutes and will be passed on to the bureau
i think we should place greater emphasis on mediterranean policy based on the diptych of democracy and development
i have received  motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
high level working group on asylum and migration
furthermore i also wish to recognise the positive and cooperative attitude of the commission to whom commissioner i would like to express my personal thanks
that is why one of our proposals is to create a budget line for  to cover these needs
we cannot criminalise immigration whether it is for economic or political reasons
we cannot herald good intentions and then fail to put them into practice because of a lack of funding
i believe this is important and i would like an answer from the council
secondly i would like to say that we have mixed feelings with regard to these action plans
this may also be the case with the balkan countries where it is clear who our partners are
i would like to ask the council if it intends to go to afghanistan and say good afternoon
we have come to tell you to respect human rights because you are sending us too many refugees
this would be absolutely incredible or at least very naive
furthermore it seems to me that broaching this issue with these countries is difficult and dangerous
i believe that there are some people that we should not even speak to on principle
i have pointed out two problems who is going to take charge of these action plans and with whom
there is a third problem how are we going to pay for them
i believe this warrants some reflection
finally the development of action plans is on the scoreboard 
i would like too to pay tribute to the work that the commission has done in this area
it is important that we approach this debate with a very clear distinction between asylum and illegal immigration
it is important that we retain the commitment set out in the geneva convention and a humane approach
this report sets out a number of proposals for action which are in my view to be welcomed
in particular it looks at immigration and at the inadequacy of current data
it looks at the problems of the action plans that have been drawn up which fail to strike the right balance between security and immigration
it looks at the policing of illegal immigration and calls for focus on combating trafficking and combating illegal employment
these are the things our member states should be doing
so in conclusion mr president and on behalf of the liberal group i welcome this report which we will vote on tomorrow
mr president unfortunately the action plans of the high level working group on asylum and migration hardly do justice to the task in hand
this is not the only problem however
let us look at the situation in iraq
the same applies in afghanistan where one is uncertain as to whom one should even start discussions with
whom should we urge to respect human rights
the way in which the high level working group was set up and operates also gives cause for criticism
this modus operandi is unacceptable
mr hernandez mollar s report is highly critical of the work of the high level working group
mr president i hope that honourable members will forgive me if i stand back and ask a fundamental question
why does the european union need a common asylum policy
on the contrary the alternative to action at eu level is a negotiation of bilateral and multilateral accords among independent nations
such accords have two potential advantages it seems to me over community action
now how can this possibly be
well it was aristotle who first adumbrated the principle that which no one owns no one will look after
his precept surely holds true among nations as it does among individuals
according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees   people applied for sanctuary in the united kingdom last year
this makes britain the most common destination for asylum claimants in europe a position we hold jointly with germany
i say astonishing because the vast number of applicants in my constituency have passed through several safe countries prior to their arrival there
mr president ladies and gentlemen this report highlights the many errors and omissions which the action plans contain
first of all there is the question of partnership particularly the place given to ngos
their opinion has not been sought or has not been taken into consideration
another error is that questions relating to asylum and those relating to emigration have been dealt with in the same way
it is true that one cannot attack the causes of migratory flows without talking about human rights
i am going to talk about asylum
this clause is a violation of international law
it refutes the principle of not expelling people before considering whether they are being sent back to a safe country
just how can we agree to making development aid conditional upon the signature of such agreements
europe must cease to turn a blind eye
the best solution to reduce the flow of migration is to support development in these countries and support the welfare of these peoples
this means cancelling the debt of developing countries
cancelling the debt would make it possible to develop educational social and medical structures which would directly benefit the population
they must be adequately looked after and in particular given access to medical care social entitlements and education for children
mr president each of the countries referred to in this report is different and each of the plans varies accordingly
this money is spent fighting a war that the sri lankan government cannot win and it is a war that the tamils cannot win either
the only solution must be a brokered peace
it could be that the european union with its historical links could act as that intermediary
my colleague anna terron has said that this report is naive
the report says that there is no end to the ethnic conflict in sri lanka
that is the effect of the war and it says that we should work more closely with the sri lankan government
yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect
we all know about the wellpublicised cases of tamil action against government forces
we have heard less about the hospitals and schools being destroyed and of torture by sri lankan government troops
nothing else matters
nothing else will solve the problems or lessen the human rights abuses
nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country
the population of europe will fall by  percent in the next  years if current levels of migration are maintained
what conclusions can we draw from this report
basically that the positions of parliament and the council are poles apart
i appreciate that parliament can support the proposed integrated and crosspillar approach which  and i quote the report  may produce positive results
i understand that the parliament is taking a cautious approach to these action plans and the commission would like to follow the same line
on the other hand one must be aware that for the time being these plans only exist on paper
clearly this is not an easy task
please allow me to highlight and subscribe to a number of important elements of your draft resolution
the partnership with the third countries concerned will be always a key element for the success of such a policy with a view to promoting codevelopment
we have to recognise that this political dialogue will have to take into account the very different political situation in each of the five countries
we are all very well aware of the fact that migration problems will not be solved within the coming month
the commission stresses that it will play an active part in maintaining that balance
the presidency has called on the member states to turn their political commitments into real activities a request that the commission has supported
in order to play a similar role for other measures the commission currently lacks the financial means
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
 budgetary guidelines
mr president ladies and gentlemen we face an enormous challenge with the budget for the year 
the main priority for the budget  must still be to remain active in the fight against unemployment
this does not mean centralisation and standardisation by no means on the contrary it means promoting cultural diversity
supporting the regional cultural industry means that we shall be laying its economic foundations and securing its potential to develop
we want the next budget to meet the challenges of efficient administration and guarantee the necessary transparency in european finances
we support the commission s efforts to introduce activity based budgeting
parliament sets particular store by this
we shall monitor these objectives closely during the reform process
the european parliament also stands by these commitments
in other words the council recognises these demands and these commitments
however we expect the council to set itself these new challenges and to act accordingly
allow me to make myself quite clear
histrionics do not help they merely create unnecessary fronts
what we need in order to finance the measures referred to is flexibility
without flexibility we will get nowhere
i therefore call on the council to stop adding fuel to the fire
do not commit yourself to a blockade attitude towards the review
we want to support these aspects in the coming budget and concentrate our efforts on these areas
at the same time we here in parliament recognise the need for an economical and efficient budget
this means avoiding an escalation of the conflict surrounding the financing of external actions at all costs
what are the challenges which we must take into account in the small budgets for the coming year
first and this applies to all the budgets budgetary rigour
compared with a total budget of eur  million that does not represent too big a bite out of the cake at our disposal
what are the challenges of activity based budgeting
of course this is a question which we must also apply to the other institutions as and where it is sensible to do so
if i look around me here i might wonder what the costs are in relation to the number of members present
this is a huge challenge for us in parliament and for the translation services in the other institutions
this gives rise to a second thought which we must consider
how can we work together with other institutions in the area of personnel recruitment
this includes preliminary scientific work i should like to be quite clear on that
we are dealing with a commission which has a joint research centre
we suggest that we make provision for new posts in certain areas but only where absolutely necessary
we shall have to examine this very closely over coming weeks and months because we have some room for manoeuvre
as far as the other institutions are concerned i only have a few comments to make
there is potential for collaboration here
we shall have to monitor the court of justice very closely
so i treat this as a beginning and not an end
that is the view of this parliament
i must emphasise that the amenability of the rapporteur whom i congratulate has enabled a broader consensus to be reached
in this way we are sending out a clear political message
the substance of the treaty must be implemented
this for us is the crucial approach
it is vital for new jobs to be created and this depends on the initiative and the creativity of entrepreneurs
let there be investment then in a culture of initiative
the report insists on the need to reform the european union s administrative system which is essential if there is to be efficiency responsibility and transparency
mr president i would like to start off by congratulating mr ferber on excellent guidelines
i welcome the clear orientation of the report to planning for enlargement
the drive towards efficiency is especially vital in the context of enlargement
we need to be imaginative about how we address the issues of staffing and building requirements
the institutions cannot respond to enlargement by just adding an extra post here or an office there
we do not want a lego approach to enlargement
this is especially important in relation to linguistic support
however these guidelines are not just about enlargement they are about policy direction for all the institutions next year
any changes have to be clearly justified and transparent
mr president commissioner the rapporteurs mrs haug and mr ferber have drafted their first report on next year s eu budget
i wish them both luck in the task facing them
drafting the budget means spending taxpayers money for that reason the work is important and calls for stringent budgetary discipline
there are many areas that call for financing but there are only a few vital ones
only the vital areas can receive public funding
in addition to stringent budgetary discipline we wish to stress the following our group gives its full support to the package of reforms as proposed by mr kinnock
activitybased budgeting and management will be the cornerstones of these reforms
they will emphasise the importance of personal responsibility diminish the bureaucratic load and enhance efficiency
but the reforms will require cooperation with the staff
that is why we have to prepare carefully for the forthcoming talks regarding the reform of staff regulations
the current staffing structure has to be clarified and made more flexible so as to facilitate the reallocation of funds for example
mrs haug s report stresses the importance of culture as a means of creating jobs
culture as such falls within the competence of the member states
however culture as a means of livelihood is an area which is rapidly growing in importance
mrs haug is not to blame
taken in isolation a good number of her subparagraphs are acceptable and some are even excellent and my group will vote in favour of them
once again there are plans to rob peter to pay paul in accordance with the sacrosanct budgetary stability pact
if we do then we should provide ourselves in moderation but steadfastly with the financial resources to do so
why
and so i welcome the reinsertion of this item in the budget as a major step
we cannot go on like this
finally i would stress the need to restructure the budget  for example we could axe taos  and thus secure new resources
there is another important point in this budget
it concerns civil dialogue
healthy growth and low unemployment are what we all want
europe needs to set the framework which is one of the reasons it created the treaty of amsterdam
but the real responsibility for employment and this is not the first time that i have stressed this lies with the member states
a greencard alone such as that for which provision has been made in germany is not a practice which makes perfect
it is in practice that a member state demonstrates at home if it is being innovative or if it is hiding with an innocent expression behind the eu
that would be cheap and it would not be right
how can we stand up to the committee on budgets demand for rigour in these circumstances
the eu will have a new fisheries policy from  a huge fascinating venture with a global dimension
later we will need the commensurate funds
thank you very much mrs langenhagen
i congratulate you on being able to express yourself in less than the time allotted to you
unfortunately others do not tend to follow suit
in the first year in which the full budgetary procedure comes to fruition we are all bound to be highly enthusiastic
the union budget of eur  billion represents so many hopes the hopes of people looking for support
there are the hopes of the unemployed who want us to support them along the path back to work
it is becoming apparent that there are people on the one side who are making promises left right and centre and raising their estimates
we must not upset the farmers too much in this european union
this division of tasks is unacceptable
in future excavators will be rattling past not tanks
you must be able to reconstruct and we want to help you
that cannot be
we have stretched out our hand
mrs haug has stretched out her hand
she has said that we are prepared to work openly with the council and the commission
we can work together
you should know that
take the outstretched hand
it is the financial situation which dictates future development
the major topics are correctly positioned in the main report but the report lacks content
fighting unemployment through economic growth is the greatest challenge facing europe
the lisbon summit announced the direction to be taken up to the year 
we must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done
the berlin resolutions set out agricultural policy up to the year 
farmers and politicians fought hard for this position
this is a policy based on rough estimates and founded on pure observation
of course the balkans must be reconstructed but overall in a spirit of social solidarity
then and i am convinced of this the farmers and cooperatives will also make their contribution
well we are all aware that the midterm review planned by the berlin summit is due to take place in 
it therefore constitutes an extremely dangerous precedent as far as our farmers are concerned
so i repeat mr president there are no grounds for the call for the revision of the financial perspective
we therefore reject it
failure to take these into account in the union s budget is equivalent to going out on a rainy day without an umbrella
we have therefore introduced an amendment to cover this
however it is not enough simply to give them access to new communication and information technologies
the internet is a tool not a magic wand
in order to deal with this methodological inconsistency we have proposed an amendment which expands on this thoughtprovoking concept
we are working on assumptions when we present this report from mrs haug
i am just referring to the haug report not to mr ferber s
my gut feeling is that there will be no agreement with the council on getting a revision of the financial perspective
the trouble with the council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at berlin
we keep being told that berlin is set in concrete
the members of lutte ouvriere will therefore be voting against the haug report
mr president i congratulate both rapporteurs on their reports which have received a high degree of consensus
today the council parliament and the commission are bound by a signed commitment
this is a very serious commitment
if we have to finance new policies we have to find new funding
providing the quantities and quality needed therefore represents a real challenge
does dg iv have any scientific studies or papers on the subject
commissioner byrne quite rightly said that as far as he was concerned public health took priority
this morning we discussed environmental protection
then it was said that environmental protection took priority
i think we should find an objective procedure which safeguards new jobs
i think that also represents an opportunity in relation to the enlargement of the eu
we must endeavour above all to include small enterprises
that is an important function and social dialogue is needed here
i would be pleased to see new initiatives in this area
this proposal is more likely to create psychological problems throughout the european union in rural areas than real problems
nevertheless we do have a fall in incomes
we did have a statement by the commission for  and that set out certain perimeters within which agricultural spending would be provided for
we need a little bit more clarity and there is tension building up between the institutions on this question of the balkans
the sooner the commission can propose to us clear figures for yearbyyear spending the better
we are not yet at the stage of talking specific figures not yet at the input stage in fact what we are discussing now is the output
what do we want what objectives do we want to achieve or support with this budget
in my opinion setting the priorities like this is the best way of starting the debate on a budgetary year
i think that this paves the way for bringing the budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion
i should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the commission
the report suggests that the other institutions will also gradually follow this lead
above all the report expresses support for the commission s administrative reform and i should expressly like to thank the rapporteur for that
mr ferber you referred in your report to other problems which need to be resolved
i would like to single out the question of financing for political parties
i think that this is an issue on which we need to take joint action to find a speedy solution
now to mrs haug s report
you have concentrated instead on the real priorities and i think that is very valuable if we are to reach an understanding
you laid particular emphasis on external policy tasks which i shall come to in a moment
at this point you have already debated this i should like to comment on the results of the lisbon summit
of course the programme financed by the structural funds is one of the most important instruments for promoting employment
i should like to comment specifically now on the question of the expenditure needed for the stability pact in the western balkans
it was also the central theme of today s debate
it has been pointed out on several sides that demands are being made on the commission
you demanded this of the commission and the council in your resolution of  december
my colleague chris patten took on this task together with mr nielson
the commission proposal makes provision for a further increase of eur  billion for agricultural market expenditure
allow me to say a few words on the overall increase in the size of the budget
we have already had the opportunity to debate this twice in the committee on budgets
we shall doubtless need to engage in intensive debate with the council as to the rate by which expenditure needs to be increased
i should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 
the budgetary procedure last year was extremely exciting to put it diplomatically
i am also convinced that should we come to blows again the committee on budgets will demonstrate the same staying powers
i can assure you that the commission will again be at your constant disposal so that we can achieve a positive result
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
combating child sex tourism
the motion for a resolution which has been tabled takes account of this fact
it no longer has a selective national or european dimension
the motion for a resolution therefore contains two central demands
secondly account must be taken of the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction
europe must take responsibility for its citizens even beyond its borders
each of us knows of cases of child abuse in our own country
the european parliament flatly rejects this regulation on possible exceptions
the member states must be proactive in opposing anything which encourages or plays down child sex tourism
respect for the rights of the child must be anchored in the european treaties if we are to guarantee protection for children in principle
the role of ngos is particularly important in this context
the freedoms and rights of citizens include freedom from physical and mental harm
this applies not only to our children but to all children
it is our duty to implement this with all the means at our disposal
everyone involved agreed on this consensus
in my view this resolution sets an example for constructive and fruitful cooperation which goes beyond the party political divide
this is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group
they are already contained in the report even if some are formulated differently
i am convinced that this is a good sensible resolution which will allow us to protect children
child sex tourism does not take place only in europe but throughout the world
parliament s approach to the fight against this evil must therefore go beyond the borders of europe
it is important to clarify the legal situation and to dispense with the notion of dual criminality
the law of the offenders country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution
offenders should not imagine themselves to be safe in some lawfree zone
it must be possible to punish offenders even if abuse is not a punishable offence in the country in which it is committed
this problem cannot be solved through national measures
we need a common approach in the european union and in the member states in cooperation with the third countries in question
children as persons with their own inviolable rights deserve our special protection irrespective of the country in which they live
this protection must be guaranteed in both theory and practice
sufficient funds must be provided to support an effective victimorientated fight against this evil
mr president i wish to congratulate the rapporteur mrs klamt on a splendid and successful piece of work
all the major players in the swedish tourist industry have already promised to comply with a special code of conduct
once they have shown that they are fulfilling the requirements of the code they will be duly approved or certified
it is about touching people s consciences
allow me to conclude my speech by talking about children  our greatest gift the most precious thing we have
they are innocent and defenceless and they seek security
we must awaken citizens consciences where our children are concerned
i also want to talk about the sexual dimension to life
we must awaken citizens consciences regarding the place of love in our lives
mr president i should first of course like to congratulate mrs klamt on her report
it is not only excellent in quality but also extremely useful
we must tackle a dreadful scourge the sexual exploitation of children
there are clients  if one can use the word in such a horrifying situation who buy children in order to indulge their sexual fantasies
these clients from europe the united states or japan are the hard core of child abusers
this horrendous phenomenon occurs principally in third countries where there is great poverty
all these causes combine to form a melting pot where lives are shattered by the greed of some parties and the deviance of others
we might remember the old japanese proverb which says the traveller knows no shame 
some people have no qualms about doing in another country what they would not do at home
most child prostitutes are part of the general prostitution market run by mafias of procurers
it is very hard to locate these children and to extract them from a life of prostitution
the origins of the problem can be attacked by tackling poverty and ignorance
there must be criminal penalties for child abusers
i suggest that we adopt this age limit and say that all minors must absolutely be protected
it is our duty to this generation which represents our future a generation which expects us to protect and respect it
it is not acceptable that our citizens should behave abroad in a way that they would not behave at home
secondly this report makes a contribution to police and judicial cooperation in the european union
this is a strong example where those eurosceptics who resist cooperation in this field are wrong
there is an urgent need for a coherent policy for the protection of children to be implemented
the commission must undertake to actually establish this european database
i wish to point out that parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject
it must be noted that the proposals made have only been implemented in part
much more effective measures are required
finally i must alert the house to the latest developments
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i too would like to offer my sincere congratulations to mrs klamt
i also think that she has avoided the pitfalls of sexophobia which was not lacking in some contributions
it is an extremely serious problem
a separate vote means that some parts of the text may be removed
in particular the group of the party of european socialists is asking for the suggestion for the establishment of a committee of enquiry to be removed
i find that cause for extremely serious concern
there are some extremely serious situations within the european union as well
we should look towards the good example set by sweden
mr president in november  the european commission adopted its first communication on combating child sex tourism
in operational terms the raft of planned operations has been implemented steadily
as i am sure you are aware your support will give us further incentive to pursue this avenue with yet more determination
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
liability for defective products
it is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this report to parliament today
this legislation substitutes distributive justice in a sense for corrective justice in this very important area of the law of civil liability
this is a very good idea
it helps to spread the risks of injury widely and ensure compensation
of course it does not in itself ensure product safety
moreover it should not be thought that this is the only basis upon which people who are injured can be helped
it is generally and rightly thought that plaintiffs lawyers are the people who do best out of the deal
the green paper raised the question of whether this scheme should be extended and whether some changes should be made
it seems to me that the green paper although it has started the debate well will not finish it completely
that is a good way of finding out if there are alarming and urgent matters needing swift action
we need more and deeper study for that purpose
i would not myself like to leave it at that
i do not think it should be prejudged
a week ago the european council in lisbon spoke out in favour of a europe of innovation
under these circumstances the question which arises is do we need to review our european liability law
do we want to mimic the americans in our liability law
how can we formulate a liability law which promotes rather than hinders innovation
we would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially
companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault
at the same time liability is statute barred after ten years and capped at eur  million
we therefore take the view that a review should only be started if there is clear proof of the need to amend the directive
caution and levelheadedness are needed
millions of cases are affected day after day
we wish the commission every success in evaluating the results of the green paper
there is also the question of derogations from general manufacturer s liability especially the socalled development risk
we need to examine if these derogations are expedient and conducive to the balance between manufacturers and consumers
this applies in particular in the case of foodstuffs and medication
we do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress
in my view applying the directive solely to private use and consumption is a questionable move
the commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods
the material damage sustained by a company is in principle no different from the material damage sustained by a private individual
and the smaller the enterprise the heavier the burden of this unequal treatment
we also need to think about the way in which liability is statutebarred
it is clear from the case of bse that a standard tenyear limitation on liability may be insufficient under certain circumstances
we could perhaps consider gearing the limitation period to the type of product
if we supplement the maccormick report in this direction the european parliament will have done a good job in the eyes of the consumer
which is why we have been elected
professor maccormick will be acutely aware of this in scotland with its own legal heritage
we should be aware that uniformity can stifle innovation and prevent adaptation to local or national circumstances and problems
it would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity
research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly
mr president i would like to join my colleagues in giving a warm welcome to professor maccormick s very realistic report
there is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged
i would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests
consumers will be the ones to lose out if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled
this green paper represents a first step towards this review
i come from a country spain where consumer legislation dictates that the manufacturer bears responsibility for development risks
there have been no bankruptcies among insurance companies or manufacturers nor has technical progress been hampered as a result
for too long the consumer has had to bear the full cost of this risk in the cause of progress
the second principle consists of removing the burden of proof from the party that has suffered the damage
we are talking about an objective responsibility and therefore the burden of proof imposed on the victim must be made as light as possible
the third principle concerns setting levels of compensation
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
electricity
mr president what is the purpose of a directive on renewable forms of energy or an owninitiative report from parliament
the directive which is currently being prepared should in my opinion have two objectives
we have many reasons to move in this direction
firstly the protection of the environment but also the creation of jobs
we have studies backed up with figures to show that renewable energies create more jobs than conventional forms of energy
what must the cornerstones of this forthcoming directive be
as regards the instruments to be implemented my report advocates subsidiarity
i believe it is too early to pass judgement on the various instruments that can be classified
on the one hand there are the fixedprice systems which have launched the renewable energy industry in europe
mr president i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent piece of work
but on balance everyone is in favour
everyone says yes we need these new sources of energy
they are a fundamental component of the st century of the st century way of thinking
the second point is that we tend to polarise and that causes problems
all we are doing is fanning the flames of enmity
i think we should put this enmity behind us and acknowledge that these renewable sources of energy only have one enemy
that enemy is our ignorance of the fantastic opportunities which they offer us
first there are ecological advantages and secondly there are job opportunities
we must recognise that
mr president madam vicepresident ladies and gentlemen parliament has basically been in agreement on this question since 
it was parliament may i remind you which had to push the previous commission in the direction of this policy
we need a much higher proportion of primary energy used
we have already come a long way but not far enough by a long chalk
we need it for climatic reasons and for industrial policy reasons because there is a global market to fill here
we are represented in accordance with the subject matter
for example elevating the feedin system to a universal panacea is wrong
we must make a distinction between these causes
as a result we and the commission are of the opinion that the member states should now be allowed to experiment
it is too early to see one system as a universal panacea and dismiss another
secondly the report also contradicts the treaty at certain points
this applies in particular to the statements on aid policy
it is true that renewable energy needs aid now and probably will for some time to come in order to get started
that is quite right and it complies with the treaty
my third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the treaty
we here in the european union cannot impose mandatory obligations on the member states
more importantly i cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder
statements like this show disdain for the consumer and disregard the principle of supply and demand
that is why madam vicepresident i have three recommendations to make to the commission
the distinction is easy to make
they need permanent protection
mr president i too should like to thank mr turmes on behalf of my group for the excellent and detailed work contained in his report
we certainly have no lack of reports
so there is no shortage of reports and they have all been translated into every possible language
we have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from  to 
at present if i remember the figures correctly we are not yet even quite at  but at 
in any case i am merely repeating the commission s figures
how can we do this
biomass and hydroelectric power account for  of renewable energy sources in the european union
wind solar energy photovoltaic energy etc only account for 
i should like to ask you commissioner to build a bridge with agricultural policy to enter into an alliance
there is of course the question of how we can finance this but at least we have technical room for manoeuvre
as far as renewable sources of energy and financing them at national level is concerned i have just a few brief comments
secondly aid must be degressive
for example we undertook at kyoto to adhere to certain quotas
no one can be punished for failing to keep to the quotas
we cannot enter into commitments willynilly and then fail to honour them
it is perhaps an unpleasant thought but it will not function otherwise
three points  firstly the whole issue of a level playing field
on targets i very much side with mr linkohr
finally i would make a plea on behalf of my group let us not set up yet another agency
paragraph  of this report calls for the establishment of a european sustainable energy agency
this parliament and the european institutions have been spawning a blizzard of new agencies all over the european union
mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work and particularly the excellent definition of renewables
this directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable
it should also encourage fair and nondiscriminatory network access as its most important item
i hope that the commissioner will really take that point to heart
most importantly the directive should propose mechanisms for the internalisation of external costs of traditional energy production
i would like to make particular reference to the unsatisfactory rate of uptake in the uk ireland and france
parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the save programme
i am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations
the creation of an internal market in electricity should provide consumers of electricity with real choice
the introduction of an element of competition in any industry should lead to more favourable pricing for the consumer
i would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of say  to  jobs per project
apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits this can actually be justified on competition grounds
it would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction
peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to ireland s energy supply
in addition to that the report emphatically calls for the european imposition of an energy tax
i am totally opposed to this approach and i reject this taxation
therefore i regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected
since we are aware of this need there is a set of relevant facts that we should consider
its content provides the necessary balance for us to be able to rate it positively but our final position will depend on the outcome with regard to certain key points
i would not like to finish without congratulating the rapporteur on his willingness to enter into dialogue and for his vigorous and thorough work
in general terms there is a need to build up an awareness amongst architects and potential customers of the technologies that are available
support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive
larger developments often fail to get planning permission sometimes because of public opposition
access to the grid system at fair prices is crucial
i hope that the commission will take note of these points
i would urge support for the amendment to assist the promotion of renewables in the remote islands of the community
i am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text
this aim is clearly visible in the commission s preparatory act
in his report mr turmes does not in all respects advocate the same way of thinking however
the report does contain many good ideas
the recorded aim of the commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported
we really do have to invest in research into energy sources
all forms of electric power must have free access to the market
the harmonisation of taxation and aid schemes is a different matter
electricity producers must be able to determine the prices at which they wish to sell
renewables can be made more competitive by increasing consumer choice
in this respect the certification of electricity is an idea to be supported
if we wish to pay more for electricity produced from wind power than from other sources for example then we should be allowed to do so
to no good purpose the report tries to define renewable energy by raising the question of peat as a special area
the position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases for example
what can we do about it
my opinion is that we should start by differentiating between compensation and subsidies
first the sustainability of energy sources
i personally come from upper austria and at present upper austria has broken the energysaving and energyrenewing records
i also think that research and development in this area need greater support
i think that this management system is particularly significant for the future of energy supplies in europe
in this respect parliament s contribution is an extremely important element in this process
this house has always been forthright in its support for active policies designed to promote renewable energies
i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to mr turmes for his work
i must point out that mr turmes s report fully concurs with these views
i must however say to mr turmes that despite what i have just said we cannot consider peat to be a renewable energy
i agree with mr turmes on the need to protect the different national systems in force at the time that this directive is adopted
to conclude mr president other speakers have mentioned repayment
mr vidalquadras and mr valdivielso both mentioned this a while ago
support must be given to renewable energies
we can however support renewable energies precisely because they are obviously based on respect for the environment and on reducing emissions
in this respect we must be able to ensure that those who do commit themselves to renewables have a fair return on their investments
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
i want to stress two points
anyway mr vander taelen admitted he did not personally witness the incident
secondly i simply cannot understand how mr vander taelen could have got the impression i was against enlargement
i have never said that
on the contrary i have stated time and again in this house that enlargement is an historic necessity
of course i am in favour of the enlargement of the european union to the east
thank you mr berthu
are there any further comments
he did not say that
he simply said of greek citizens  in other words people who are resident in greece
i say this because mr katiforis is not here and so that the minutes can be corrected accordingly
absolutely
i remember that too
that will be corrected
the minutes were approved
madam president this is not about the minutes but about a point of order
the question on quite a few people s lips is what is to become of this report
will it be made public
i understand that the chairmen of the groups have been able to have a look at the report
i would like to ask you what you are intending to do with it
will you find a way of making it available to the press or to those who favour doing so appending a few comments yes or no
it is standard procedure mr staes
after that has been done the court of auditors will draw up its final report
i do not think it is up to the president of parliament to issue this report to the press
this is not a lack of transparency
it is not up to me to do it
i have done what i had to do which was to send it to each group chairman concerned
mr birdal had asked to be released on health grounds after being attacked
quite mr wurtz
we raised this matter yesterday and i am completely in agreement about approaching the turkish government along those lines
the echelon system
having said this the presidency considers that everything must be done to create an area of freedom security and justice at european level
our aim is to build a more open and secure europe founded on an attachment to our common fundamental values
in certain clearly specified and truly exceptional cases the interception of telecommunications may be justified under these conditions
the committee raised these matters and i have been asked to comment on them in the letter from your president
in the area of police cooperation the council adopted a resolution on  january  on the lawful interception of telecommunications
in november  a code of conduct containing this same list of specifications indicated in the resolution was established between the fifteen and norway
in  the council submitted an initiative on the lawful interception of telecommunications with regard to new technologies for assessment
the council is continuing the work on this issue but has not yet adopted a final position
over four years of negotiations on this draft convention are nearly complete
we therefore hope that the adoption of the act establishing the convention will take place during the justice and home affairs council in may
measures have also been specified on data protection in the europol convention
it must be stressed that europol does not have powers of investigation and does not carry out work of an operational nature
it cannot gather this data directly i will clarify this for you
it is the responsibility of each member state to send data to europol
in this way the general rules on the protection of data sent to europol by the member states are respected
each national supervisory authority has an essential role to play in this area
i must also speak briefly about the data protection rules within the schengen information system
this system provides for an authority responsible for protecting personal data
finally i must mention data protection within the third pillar
these ideas are still being developed
to conclude i must say that we fully understand the political concerns underlying this parliament initiative
mr president the commission has taken note of the recent debate with concern
we received a letter by madame fontaine to mr prodi yesterday asking the commission to focus its statement on certain questions
i will try to cover most of them
respect for human rights and the rule of law constitute the foundations of the european union
the european convention on human rights recognises the right to privacy as one of those rights
all member states of the european union are signatories of the convention
the specific competencies attributed to the community are defined in the treaty
the commission can only act within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the treaty
the community has a clear competence in the field of data protection and in research and technological development
national security questions belong to the exclusive competence of the member states
exploiting the full potential of information technology and the internet are key elements in achieving this goal
electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life of european citizens
a wellfunctioning electronic communications infrastructure has become crucial for our economies
a key tool to secure the confidentiality of electronic communications is encryption or cryptography
encryption means the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a decryption key
when the european parliament considered the issue of interception of telecommunications in  its resolution underlined the importance of encryption
the current rules for intracommunity trade are laid down in the socalled dualuse regulation
for external trade the wassenaar arrangement imposes export controls on strong encryption products
the commission hopes that the revision of dualuse regulation can be completed during the portuguese presidency
the commission considers that enhancing the security of communications over the internet by using encryption is a priority
the introduction of such products is not without complexities
software whose source code is not open leaves the user in uncertainty
the possibility of builtin circumvention of encryption cannot be excluded
secondly effective use of encryption requires a safe key management system
let me now turn to data protection
both these directives exclude from their scope activities that fall outside community competence
this wording of the directive reflects the wording of article  of the european convention on human rights
at the same time activities outside community competencies had to be excluded
the commission has not been entirely satisfied with the transposition of the data protection directives
as regards the general data protection directive the commission has launched infringement procedures against six member states
the commission has been asked whether it can confirm the existence of the activities described in the report of mr campbell
however it is clear that technological possibilities to intercept electronic communications exist
and there is no evidence to say that the available technologies are not used
due to the recent allegations presented in the public debate the commission has sought clarification from the member state that has been mentioned in this context
the uk legislation also foresees a special parliamentary oversight committee
the commission has also sought clarification from the united states government
the commission will not fail to fulfil its obligation under the treaty if community law is breached
in the past a great many parliamentary questions have been simply ignored
we must now calmly consider what measures are to be taken in order to protect the european economy effectively
less helpful in this regard are the hasty proposals tabled by the four smaller groups in this house
what we have here is not huxley s brave new world taking shape but merely industrial espionage
who i wonder would call for a committee of inquiry
the american president or the head of the british secret service who is not even known in britain
what is this committee supposed to find out
no the time for investigations and debate is past now we must act
we must put this subject on the agenda of the next session of the world trade conference
in contrast to a committee of inquiry which in this case would serve no purpose this would be a constructive initiative
just how difficult the situation is you can see from two remarks made in the last three minutes
mrs klamt says that we all know that the united states of america engages in industrial espionage
so what is to be done then
i should like to say that what i have heard this morning from both institutions gives rise to more questions than answers
do we want a committee of inquiry
do we want a nonpermanent committee
i was therefore of the opinion that it was too early for a committee of inquiry
that is something at least
having said that i was expecting the council to give us some details about the problem we are trying to deal with today
i have to say i am disappointed
to use a sporting metaphor the representatives of the council and the commission have been doing what i call the fencing sidestep
it is very effective in fencing but i dislike it in politics
i have no regrets whatsoever about having taken the initiative with my group in calling for a parliamentary committee of inquiry into this matter
i also want to point out that while speeches on the principle are of course interesting we have to have the courage to talk about the facts
we have since discovered that this system does exist but we do not know exactly how it works
i expected the council presidency to make a statement about that
is the british government being open about it
is it collaborating in the system or not
i think we have a right to know
the commission is responsible for ensuring that community law is observed
we have good reason to believe that community law is being flouted in this case
directives are obviously fine if they are applied but what use are they if there is clearly technology available for bypassing them
especially when we know that certain member states are probably collaborating in order to bypass them
i am really very worried
if this parliament seeks to represent the people of europe it really must clarify this situation
we will not be doing that if we routinely wait for initiatives from the council and the commission
in view of what i have just heard there is no genuinely open debate
secondly we said effective economic protection systems and encryption must be adopted
now we are told the same thing all over again eighteen months later
are we going to pass another resolution in strasbourg repeating the  resolution
i honestly believe that it is now too late for that
madam president i actually think the speeches from the council and the commission were most enlightening
the united states now acknowledges the existence of the echelon system
tongues are being loosened in certain union governments
the press is crammed full of details about this allpervasive electronic monitoring network
and yet how embarrassed the council and the commission sounded
what tangled comments they made to avoid answering our questions
where is this taking us
with friends like that who needs enemies
whether people like it or not the echelon file is now open and it will remain open
our fellow citizens have been alerted
in tabling the call for a committee of inquiry over a quarter of the members of this parliament have made that choice
i think parliament will increase its stature by taking up this case by a majority
madam president i shall be very brief as i only have one minute
we would rather not believe this affair is indicative of a general attitude towards the european union
under the circumstances we are stunned by the council s statement
that is obviously a shock not in terms of our technical knowledge of encryption but in terms of our political beliefs
we have believed in the great market as if it were god and competition and competitiveness all under the governance of the wto
and now we find out that people are cheating and spying on this market creating distortions of competition
we thought mr haider s austria was endangering our freedom
so madam president are you still prepared to go to london
will you ever go to sydney again
will you ever go to ottawa or wellington again
and we thought there was solidarity in europe
now we find that britain s solidarity extends across the atlantic and across the pacific ocean
we thought we were building europe making europe stronger
but stronger than whom
stronger in opposition to iraq
in opposition to the serbs
stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism
it is an ethnic group with a religious base the holy alliance of adam smith and calvin
so is the catholic europe of gasperi schuman and adenauer going to apologise
apologise to the people spied on for all that evangelism
echelon is the french word for rung and i am afraid this echelon is taking us down to the bottom rung and we will end up at dignity level zero
poor old european commission
poor old european council of ministers
poor old european union
we are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth
as a uk member of this parliament i understand other members concerns
this morning and in recent days in particular we have read and heard a lot of allegations
that is after all the nature of intelligence and military information work
as mr liikanen has said everything done in the united kingdom is in line with a proper legal framework
everything is subject to close parliamentary scrutiny in the house of commons
i therefore have three questions
finally how can we defend ourselves against this threat
the commissioner has spoken of work on cryptography which was also mentioned in parliament s last recommendation
this is a complex assembly of measures which have only been timidly belatedly and in part announced by the council and the commission
this then provided us with the notorious infopol documents
how great is the damage which has already been caused to the european economy
are there companies in addition to thomson and the airbus consortium which have sustained damage
i should like to quickly make the following points
mr wiebenga said that i did not clearly and specifically condemn echelon
i did do so and i do so again

i can only answer the member s second question in writing as i do not have precise information on this
i would also like to tell this house that the concerns voiced here are of course shared by the presidency
we will keep parliament constantly informed of developments in this respect
president can i first thank parliament for the discussion
here there have been programmes for eighteen months
mrs berger asked whether some companies have been losing contracts because of espionage
no companies have contacted the commission on that issue
i think this decision is very clear
thank you commissioner
i have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to article  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place during the next partsession
decision by the patent office on the cloning of human beings
on behalf of the commission i should like to say that the commission shares these concerns
it seems clear to everyone involved that this patent should not have been granted in the form it was
the european patent office has issued a press statement to that effect
you have a joint motion before you today which includes such charges
therefore the question is what does the commission intend to do about it
that is the reason why i am here today
some oppositions to this patent have already been filed
such a delay in correcting what is in effect an admitted error is clearly undesirable
now the european patent office said that such a preliminary opinion will be without prejudice to the final ruling of the opposition division in this case
but the office assures me that proceedings will speedily lead to conclusions subject to respecting the rights of the parties to be heard
this is a flagrant violation of human dignity
we now see how important these clarifications were
the european patent office has incorporated the european union s directive into its own directives
what has happened in this connection is therefore a flagrant breach of the european patent office s own rules
it must also meet with vigorous protest in the european parliament
it is not however a question of the directive we adopted in  being a bad one
it is a question of its needing to be applied better
we shall in any case vote in favour of this resolution because the european parliament must send out a clear signal in this regard
however the question disappeared without trace in the course of this house s business
instead of the required answers we have today received an explanation from the commission which cannot be the last word as far as the european parliament is concerned
why do i mention this
that would lead to a disastrous situation in which the principles of the inviolability of the human being and of human dignity would be completely lost
clearly everything must be done in order to completely do away with patent no ep    and any similar gaffes
clearly we must move as quickly as possible to close the legal loophole constituted by the flawed european patent
moreover everyone must adhere to this
mr president european patent no ep    has been a great shock to us
it amounts to deliberately awarding a patent for the breeding of human beings
the genetically modified human being would himself be degraded to the status of a product of genetic technology and that would be a flagrant affront to human dignity
this patent is no isolated case however
it is only the tip of the iceberg or a pandora s box which has been open for a long time
we must vehemently oppose this commercialisation of human genes and these flagrant violations of human dignity
in their defence the officers of the patent office refer to the language problem
it is a matter of defending the dignity of the human being from conception to natural death
each person is unique there is something sacred in each human being
it is a good thing that at least for the space of a short debate we have remembered everyone s fundamental right to their own unique identity
mr president the public alarm at the granting of this patent is i feel totally justified
thirdly and most importantly we are considering an issue which is at the very root of our civilisation
mr president i would thank the commission for its statement and would urge it to file an official objection to this patent
the council should give the commission the mandate to do this
it is debatable whether this directive for which i was the rapporteur is in fact a suitable tool for managing the problems involved
it would have been helpful if whoever was giving vent to his indignation had taken the trouble to read the patent
these are two clear infringements of the directive on biopatents
it is now therefore a question not of again bringing the directive into question but of enforcing it
it is after all one of my own country s most distinguished universities
of course i would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern
but until there is something more i think it appropriate that the wilder claims and suggestions should be ignored
i believe that the work which is being carried out in edinburgh is not permitted by national law in some other member states
perhaps you will allow me to pass a few comments on what the various members of this parliament have said
i have no objection whatsoever to making that letter public
so as far as that goes mr rothley may rest assured that the commission has reserved that right to itself
i agree with him
i think that the directive is a good one
it was also mentioned by frau gebhardt that the cloning of human beings should be forbidden
well president it is forbidden
may i draw the attention of mrs gebhardt to the fact that the directive specifically forbids that
it seems to me that that is all we need to do provided of course that the directive is properly applied
the last issue i should like to deal with is the matter of the community patent
several speakers this morning have spoken about the european patents
now a european patent is what the european patent office grants
the proper term to use is a community patent
we are working on that
it is not an easy thing principally because the european patent office is not a community institution
that presents us with certain legal problems and we are trying to solve them
it is indeed true that the language problems are considerable
mr president i just wanted some further clarification
not so
i would merely ask you to be aware of this
what i in fact said is that i should like absolute clarification that these are in fact the contents
that is a quite different statement from the one you attributed to me
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to article  of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place at  am
the sitting was suspended at  am and resumed at  am
vote
mr president i know that there are to be no votes on the opinions which have been submitted by the various committees
the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities has tabled a special opinion
i just want to point out that what is most important in this opinion is of course the view that proper resources should be set aside for mainstreaming
a mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion
i do not want there to be a mistake here even if we are not voting on it
the last part of section  of our opinion following the words community action programmes should cooperate  is to be deleted
the committee voted to remove this section but it has nonetheless been included by mistake
i want this part to be removed and i want to give notice of the fact now before we proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
joint motion for a resolution on mediterranean policy
concerning amendments nos  and 
mr president the oral amendment which i am about to read out replaces amendment no  and amendment no 
there was consensus among all the groups tabling the joint motion
parliament adopted the joint resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
joint motion for a resolution on the decision of the european patent office on the cloning of human beings
concerning amendment no 
mr president excuse me if i am a bit hoarse but i have a cold
the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has requested a split vote on this amendment
i think that the first part of the amendment is uncontroversial but there is a linguistic problem in the second part
i think it is a translationrelated problem
it is therefore important for us to adapt the german language version to the wording also chosen for the fifth framework programme on research
it is not therefore a question of tightening up parliament s position but of emphasising what we have already decided
the german must therefore read verbrauchende embryonenforschung 
we are therefore voting against the amendment even with this correction
parliament adopted the joint resolution
explanations of vote  haug report a
so it is with great pleasure that i have voted for paragraphs  and 
 sv we have voted against a number of points in mrs haug s report on the guidelines for the  budgetary procedure
enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways
in spite of this enlargement is not mentioned in mrs haug s report
instead the social and cultural dimension of europe is chosen as the most important point to be taken up in the guidelines for the  budget
aid for the reconstruction of kosovo is taken up in mrs haug s report as another priority area which is something we support wholeheartedly
as liberals we believe that agricultural policy should be adapted to the market and made less bureaucratic
all direct aid given to agricultural production ought to gradually be abolished
the eu plays an important role when it comes to employment especially through the single market
we would nonetheless emphasise that unemployment cannot be reduced only by means of political decisions at european level
the committee on fisheries does not want more money
this industry also generates numerous landbased jobs in the processing industry and in the dockyards
the cheapest jobs are those which do not have to be created because they have not already disappeared
in the process of reaching an agreement we will therefore see to it that the union s support for fishing is consolidated and increased
the haug report reveals that there is a serious risk that what happened before will be repeated in the  budgetary procedure
it is imperative that new priorities are given new financial resources
we do not agree with this approach and therefore cannot approve the report
ferber report a
there is too much staffrelated expenditure
haug and ferber reports a and 

we condemn the priority accorded by the rapporteur to the financing of policies newly introduced in the treaty of amsterdam
it should be remembered here that in  the midterm analysis planned at the berlin summit in the context of agenda  will be known
resolution on hushkits b
this is in spite of the fact that the engines in question would easily meet all noise and emissions standards
this regulation provides for the banning as from may  of certain noisy aircraft equipped with noise reduction devices known as hushkits 
the civil aviation industry is experiencing annual growth of some  and this is expected to double in  years
this has to be accompanied by a progressive reduction in noise ascribable to aircraft
the noise issue is equally topical in american airports
stricter rules on aircraft noise must be established at international level within the icao
that is stressed in the resolution
in  the regulation was suspended for a year it will be implemented in may with a large number of exemptions
the american industry exerts enormous pressure and the situation is distorted by the prospect of the elections
but how can anyone defend such exemptions on the pretext that there is disagreement
did we tell french and belgian chocolate manufacturers the directive would be suspended or there would be exemptions
is the european union really just there to serve the multinationals and big business
this is not a lot of fuss about nothing
the union should not be afraid of american threats and retaliatory measures
a strong message is needed so that the international community can get the measure of the strength of european convictions in the battle against noise
resolution on mediterranean policy
so why do we forget the material military and diplomatic support france has given those regimes
since the launch of the euromediterranean partnership on  and  november  in barcelona the political context has changed
the partnership has failed to meet the expectations raised by the countries participating in the conference
in fact the latter must take action to achieve a cultural social and human partnership
there are still many social challenges to be faced
the implementation of an economic partnership is especially vital for agriculture
the european union must provide compensation for the crucial difficulties in this sector notably as regards fruit and vegetables and winegrowing
we are hoping for synergy in the coordination of the interregional and transnational cooperation programmes and for coordination between the interreg and meda programmes
in fact member states are directly affected by this policy
hernandez mollar report a
so we are astonished at the severity of the european parliament s report and the general tone of yesterday s debate
the fact is to have any impact on migratory flows it is necessary to act on their indirect causes
so in our opinion it is an intelligent exercise and the kind of thing which should be done more often at european level
why then are so many members critical
but that is not a defect for us on the contrary it is a good idea
indeed it is an absolutely indispensable aspect of the plans
it makes no sense to want everything and its opposite at the same time
i abstained on the final vote on this report on the basis of my speech on wednesday evening
when it comes to the right of asylum statements of principle are one thing the reality of the situation is quite another
in france for example only  of  asylum applications have been accepted

in the last half century after several centuries pause massive migrations have started again on the planet
from south to north from east to west across europe these ceaseless waves of migrants destabilise the economic budgetary social urban religious and cultural balance
since the treaty of amsterdam europe has been in charge of the regulation of asylum refugees and migrants so what is europe doing
europe is drawing up plans and developing measures  to be precise with unspecified funding of course
faced with a planetary phenomenon of migration we counter it with plans budgets and information campaigns
in the end if there is a migration towards the european continent that is because this continent is emptying fast
klamt report a
the report is also a good text in that respect
of course our institution as such is not responsible for this evil
all the same the coincidence is distressing
that dignity must be defended and promoted for each and every one of us
if dignity does not belong to everyone then it ceases to exist
exploiting that economic and social misery as pimp or client is a criminal act and that is how we must approach it
the klamt report is perhaps not sufficiently ambitious but at least it has the merit of going in the right direction
we must not forget that there are many europeans who feed this scourge of the new millennium
the european commission has drawn up a report of the measures which have been taken in this field
i also think it is essential to incorporate the rights of the child into the charter of fundamental human rights
exemplary penalties must be imposed on the people guilty of such monstrous behaviour
that is intolerable
we must not be blind to the fact that the internet facilitates these practices 
i am voting with total conviction in favour of ewa klamt s report on combating child sex tourism
amendment no  which defines the child as any person under the age of  years seems to me essential to the consistency of this report
the report rightly places this form of slavery in the general context of crossborder organised crime
faced with the exponential development of the latter on the internet amendment no  is essential
but a fundamental boundary has been overstepped when sexually exploited children are also represented as workers 
amendment no  broadens the terms of this measure
let us try to look out for the future of these child victims not just for the psychological consequences but also for the medical effects
the sex industry destroys the prospects of children who pick up the aids virus and sexually transmissible diseases
these sick children cannot even return to their families which are just as crushed by poverty and social or ethnic discrimination
mrs klamt has presented a good report today
obviously this form of tourism is a crime
but should we be astonished at this phenomenon when at the same time the development of prostitution more generally does not cause offence
this is an area where double standards must apply least of all
belgian society is currently being rocked by paedophile trials and similar proceedings often go on in our own countries
 i wholeheartedly support ewa klamt s report on the fight against child exploitation
clearly with new technology and globalisation child pornography on the internet in particular is an evergrowing international problem
technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate
at present it seems that animals have more rights than children in europe
progress is of course being made
but whilst i welcome the positive noises coming from brussels it is not enough
that is too precious to become the plaything of wealthy western tourists
maccormick report a
however allow me to say that it does not go far enough for me or the pensioners party
how often do european pensioners receive their pensions on time
how often do widows and elderly people receive the correct allowance
the states are guilty of such offences and should be held liable
turmes report a
mr president ladies and gentlemen environmental protection is a prestigious field of politics and rightly so
however it is precisely the subject of renewable energy sources that must be freed from the burden of ideology and wishful thinking as well as from the material misuse of energy sources themselves
the present report on the subject of renewable energy sources does precisely the opposite and that is why i have rejected it
we are still talking about mere thousandths of the overall requirement
last year in germany two billion kilowatt hours were generated through wind power
mr president i read the turmes report on electricity very carefully and i voted for it
how could anybody fail to support any initiative which stresses the importance of electricity of which we are all aware
nowadays it is impossible to live without electricity
electricity is like the water we drink and the air we breathe
do we pay for the air we breathe
then we should not have to pay for electricity either if we do not have the means to do so
 sv regarding paragraphs  concerning supports to renewable energy sources we would provide the following clarification
in addition support ought to be given to research and development projects for the promotion of renewable energy sources
you ingenuously demand the uniform application of community guidelines on state aid with all member states and all energy subject to the same provisions
you have the merit of having shown your hand although in a rather peremptory way by affirming that the member states recognise that it is necessary to promote renewable sources of energy as a priority
that simple observation is all it takes to condemn a text where good intentions are not enough to mask federalist logic and a dangerous lack of realism
resolution on the cloning of human beings
however we were very divided when it came to the vote
i think it was the wish of the group of the european people s party to attempt to transform this motion for a resolution into an advert for the patenting directive
they did not succeed but they have nonetheless weakened the resolution
that is unfortunately not the case
contrary to what parliament believes this patent is no isolated case
this is an affront to human dignity and also signifies a commercialisation of the human body
it is also nonsense and selfdeluding to maintain that the directive on patenting would prohibit this
in its current form the adopted text further reduces the minimum level of protection provided under the  directive on biopatents
in order to counter this danger my group and i have voted in such a way as to reject any elements which have nothing to do with patent protection for biotechnological inventions
in the end we have voted as a unit against the resolution
it is human dignity which provides the decisive standard
 we have had a lengthy debate in this house on the patenting of biotechnology
i myself together with other green deputies warned of the consequences at the time
genetic information can only be discovered it cannot be invented
the human genome and its sequences should not be patentable
the granting of this patent by the european patent office is deeply shocking and must be revoked
this has been done for many years and is a major method of learning how genes and cells function
it bears no relation to genetic manipulation of people or embryos
it is misleading to suggest that the object of this patent is to genetically manipulate humans
the university of edinburgh have indicated their willingness to cooperate with any suitable modification of the patent
this is what the edinburgh research is about
unfortunately companies have already been developing and patenting cloning techniques
a patent for these techniques has been granted in the uk since august of 
indeed this experimentation under the guise of therapeutic cloning is already patented and the object of ongoing research
scientific research is now doing more than explore and analyse the world it is changing it
where will it end
why should we put our trust in science alone in this new context
as elected representatives and citizens we are outpaced by issues where the scientific component is too strong
there is plenty of money at stake
will the political authorities have the power to regulate this new market and ensure that the ethical dimension is respected in genetics
or will we soon find ourselves in the kind of world depicted in that excellent film gattaca 
it is not enough for the patent office to acknowledge a mistake and make its excuses
there are so many uncertainties at the legal and moral level about the future acceptability of patents applied for which are currently in the thousands
the debate about the moral boundaries of biotechnology and how to control them has begun
that concludes the vote
adjournment of the session
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament
the sitting was closed at  pm
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday  march 
the whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this house to act
mr andrews there is of course no need to start a debate on the subject
madam president as many of us know last friday saw the inauguration in vienna of the monitoring centre for racism xenophobia and antisemitism
i would like to thank you for your forceful intervention
thank you mr imbeni for your extremely kind words
i believe it was very important for this house
thank you mr imbeni for your comments
would it be possible for you to ask the council to make a statement on ethiopia in place of the statement on iraq
madam president i should like to draw your attention to an internal matter
in other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve
i would hope that happened in the european parliament
one can form one s own opinion and keep quiet
however there was one incident last week about which we cannot keep quiet any longer
mr berlusconi made the following joke do you know why an aids sufferer needs to take a bath filled with sand
the answer is in order to get used to lying in the soil
these words were spoken by a member of this house
i refuse to believe that anyone here would keep calm if this joke was aimed at jews or blacks
i think that a reaction from yourself madam president would be wholly appropriate
i can only say that these remarks have shocked me deeply
applause from the left
thank you
the member you have quoted is not here to answer you or to defend himself
mixed reactions
these are big issues and parliament must address them seriously
finland is the only country whose television picture cannot be picked up in parliament
i would have hoped that such a small matter as this would be sorted out the dutch often complained about the lack of dutch television during parliamentary part sessions
they now get two channels and i hope that we finns will now get at least one
i have already complained about this on various occasions in parliamentary sittings
what is the problem with you bureaucrats that you cannot sort these things out in this house
meanwhile you allow five million euros to be stolen
thank you mr seppanen
it is not just a little detail
mrs banotti who is dealing with the matter will be able to give you the latest details
i am really sorry that he has not been handed that card
i will attend to it this week
i can assure you that the quaestors are working on it
thank you mrs banotti
madam president ladies and gentlemen considerable changes have been made to the proposed agenda
reports have been shifted around and time slots have even been changed
tomorrow we will start at  am for the first time
we are now faced with a dilemma
as elected members of our national parliaments we represent our electorate and this must be reflected in all votes
i therefore wonder how we are to fulfil our obligations in the best way
you received an email last week about our intention to apply for the quorum on friday
the conference of presidents has also received a letter on this matter
however the agenda is not heavier as a result if anything as i have already stated this coming friday s agenda is lighter
our plans therefore remain unchanged and this means that if on friday the necessary  members are not present then the vote will not take place
in return i promise that i shall raise the matter at the conference of presidents
the group leaders have heard your points
in the dimitrakopoulosleinen report which is due to be debated on wednesday there is a paragraph which i shall read in the original french
les affaires du parlement europeen ne peuvent pas faire l objet d un recours juridictionnel no actions may be brought in connection with the interna corporis affairs of the european parliament
in my opinion the bureau should rule that a report which has these characteristics is inadmissible
thank you mr ribeiro we shall look into your statement very carefully
football is a sport which transcends the world
almost every country plays football
it is known as a beautiful game
in about three months belgium and holland will play host to euro 
there is every likelihood that incidents such as those that happened last week will be repeated again in belgium and holland
thank you mr miller
we shall do so
we have often voted on recommendations on sportsrelated violence and what you tell us is rather worrying
this is a very sensible suggestion in my view
we would also like to see iraq treated as an urgency because eventually parliament will need to pass its verdict
just because the council is not ready that does not mean that we in parliament cannot bring the matter up for discussion
we have a comprehensive package which will probably enable us to cover all the points which are important to this parliament
agenda
sittings in strasbourg from  to  april 
relating to tuesday
the council has informed us that it did not wish to make a statement on iraq at the present time
we of course regret this but the fact remains
we have no means to force the council to make a statement
their proposal was to enter these items on the agenda instead of the statement on iraq
let me turn now to mr hansch
is this what you propose
so tuesday turkey wednesday ethiopia
i would prefer it if we could hold the debate on ethiopia when the council is present
mr van velzen the council is indeed in attendance on wednesday i am assured
mr hansch has just spoken in support of this request
if there is no one who wishes to speak against it i shall put the matter to the vote
parliament gave its assent
relating to wednesday
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal
madam president i would suggest that this will give us the opportunity to adopt a short resolution on ethiopia
yes of course
parliament gave its assent
relating to thursday
regarding the topical and urgent subjects of major importance i have a number of proposed amendments
first of all a request from the liberal group to replace the first item nonproliferation treaty  with a new item entitled iraq 
we shall then be able to withdraw our proposal under item i
unless you want us to proceed directly to the vote on replacing item iv
madam president i should be glad if we could vote on item iv before i decide about that
for goodness sake let s vote on it
yes i think that is clearer
i would rather keep to the order in which the proposals were received
i shall now put to the vote the request from the liberal group to replace the item on the nonproliferation treaty with a new item entitled iraq 
parliament gave its assent
who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal
the originators of the proposal seem to be happy to agree to that
thank you for that
there is therefore no need to vote on this proposal since it has been withdrawn
i then received five proposals to add a fifth subitem to the human rights section
it is up to the house to decide
i think we are all in agreement
i shall however at least notify you of the other proposals if only out of consideration for the members and the groups which tabled them
so i have the proposal regarding zimbabwe
the proposal for an item on the ethiopian famine has been withdrawn
who is in favour of entering zimbabwe as the fifth subitem in the human rights section
parliament gave its assent relating to friday
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of or against this proposal
i therefore ask that a resolution be taken in connection with the oral question
do you mean after the oral question on the storms
i do not think that would be a problem
parliament gave its assent
sittings in brussels on  and  may no amendments
the order of business was adopted thus amended
child pornography on the internet
at that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children the most vulnerable section of our society
mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world
there are very few regulations which are concerned with what the internet is used for
my report for the first time puts forward a definition
we have been short of a definition until now
although there was an initial austrian initiative which this report supports it did not contain a definition
in our report we have entered a definition which we hope will be acceptable internationally
we can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion
if we are lucky we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices
we have required within our report that european nation states should have action plans for dealing with the abuses which take place
we are concerned with the production sale distribution and deliberate possession of pornographic images showing children
we want to stamp out this appalling abuse
in our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout europe take action to deal with these matters
we have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations
i believe that we have managed to do so
we have had nothing but positive contributions
in my own committee this report was adopted with  votes in favour and one abstention
that i regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future
madam president child pornography is a loathsome form of crime
measures at transnational level are required especially due to the denationalised nature of the internet
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur mr kirkhope for his most excellent report
in this regard it is perhaps particularly pleasing that it is from great britain that mr kirkhope comes
it is good that he has defined child pornography and i believe we have arrived at a satisfactory compromise
it is particularly good that mr kirkhope has also stated that everything that has the appearance of being child pornography shall also be included under this definition
contact points or special units shall be set up in the member states according to the draft
this will hopefully lead to better investigations
there is a need for more expertise in this area if it is to be possible to carry out professional investigations
europol will be involved as will the candidate countries
it is a good thing that crime in third countries will be punished in accordance with national legislation
our line of argument allows for flexibility in defining the agelimit that strikes the hardest blow to child pornography
all children should have the right to a childhood
that ought to be a basic human right
this obligation must have legal implications
the importance of the internet is obvious to us all
it has come to be indispensable as a modern communication tool
we need it for exchanging information for learning and for all sorts of operations
however increased use of the internet also means increased access to violence and pornography not least child pornography
children themselves have access to violence on the internet which must be objectionable to us all
parents are powerless in the face of this phenomenon because they cannot keep up with this technological progress
consequently an urgent need has arisen to combat child pornography on the internet effectively
this is the key to prevention
we must not therefore simply act in a preventative fashion we must offer longterm help to those children affected
the attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all member states
according to the estimates of the economic and social committee there are more than five million children working in europe
most of these children work in areas such as pornography drug trafficking child pornography and sexual tourism
these children are in particular need of society s protection
these events are occurring every day every hour and perhaps every minute
paedophiles are limited only by their own technical capability or the equipment which they can afford
the internet itself cannot commit crimes
what is criminal is the behaviour of some  to  of internet users who misuse the net for illegal purposes
 to  of the internet is legal
all the same the internet is not beyond the law
the problem of crime on the internet cannot be resolved by any state in isolation
the eu has already taken several measures towards this which i will not go into any further here
i would like to congratulate mr kirkhope on his report it is a highquality text
all the proposed measures are suitable and necessary to effectively combat child pornography
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to thank mr kirkhope for his excellent report
what exactly needs to be done in order to combat child pornography effectively especially on the internet
first of all we need to set up an easily accessible and recognisable contact point
secondly for the purposes of enforcement police forces and the judiciary need more expertise regarding the internet and ancillary digital technology
this is simply lacking
officials need to be trained well otherwise they will be unable to combat child pornography effectively
lastly the penalties must be harmonised in europe and must be increased
if not the internet will remain a threat and it will never be the challenge which it could be
mr president commissioner vitorino ladies and gentlemen firstly i would like to congratulate mr kirkhope
in fact his name fills us with hope
mr kirkhope s document has lifted the lid on a great deal  a great deal of child suffering and human suffering
we are delighted that there is now a definition at long last
after all there is quite obviously a correlation between child pornography on the internet and trafficking in children
this correlation is evident in the countries of origin the transit countries and the host countries in the european union
this correlation is also evident in the case of possibly kidnapped and missing children
recently mothers recognised their own children on a porn website which could be viewed at police stations in france
in order to conceal their own identity they use the bank details of others
in order to stamp out child pornography we need a multidisciplinary approach
the police and criminal investigation services must be able to do their jobs well
this means that the politicians need to ensure that the police can do its job effectively
politicians too should believe that child pornography exists on the internet
the ngos are doing a great job
to finish off i would like to point out that some pimps use the internet to distribute photographs of young people engaged in prostitution
mr president mr kirkhope s report has the virtue of drawing the council s attention to a dreadful criminal activity
communication technologies transform data
the internet thus has formative and demultiplying effects on the trade and traffic in child pornography
this trafficking is on a scale hitherto unknown in terms of its extent and the geographical areas covered
it is an urgent state of affairs and specific action must be proposed in order to deal with the networks that exist
what we have to deal with here are ephemeral evolving sites which adapt constantly and which are complicated to monitor
this state of affairs makes it essential to draw up a survey of paedophile networks within the countries of the european union
the existence of these networks confirms the need for a common judicial area
i share his opinion but given the crossborder nature of the problem the response must be at union level
the common judicial area does exist with europol schengen and eurodac
let it be noted that it is used primarily and indeed exclusively to control the flow of migration and to suppress illegal immigration
there is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography who are often repeat offenders
what is needed is prevention in order to counter their activities and to dismantle their networks
the european union must provide itself with a suitable structure a european instrument to enforce information exchange and action
the union should be in a position to apply penalties to any state which does not fulfil its criminal law obligations in the matter of combating paedophilia
the dutch police have drawn up a file of several hundred children from a cdrom containing   images or sequences of child pornography available on the internet
interpol has acknowledged having a file of  photos
why are these valuable documents not used
who are these children and what is being done to locate them
if there are records of offenders it must be possible to keep records of victims
it is our duty ethically as human beings to do everything we can to find them
for all these reasons i think the european union must make combating this form of crime a priority
mr kirkhope s report is filled with good intentions but further proposals must be made in order to deal with the present situation
to govern however means to make plans
and we have to investigate the deepseated reasons for this scourge in order to attempt to find an effective cure for the problem
this is an irresponsible attitude
is this though not also the inevitable continuation of a number of measures which have already been taken
for example in the area of trivialising homosexuality
i am well aware that not all child pornography necessarily
mixed reactions  you see you are proving the truth of what i am trying to say
this is necessarily the first step on the road which leads ultimately to the deviancies of child pornography
i know i am well aware of mr schulz s customary protests
that ladies and gentlemen is what i wanted to say
we therefore do not want a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees
the internet minitel the post are nothing more than the medium
it is the originators we must combat
it is not the internet itself which is to blame but the child pornographers and they must be punished severely
everyone knows perfectly well that that is not the case today
applause and mixed reactions
it was important for it to be subjected to as few rules as possible
it has since become apparent that the internet is merely a reflection of our society
in addition to a wealth of information and expertise it also reflects the criminal underbelly of society including child pornography
the nature of the internet is such that it has become easier to disseminate child pornography anonymously rapidly and across national borders
this is a good reason to take action against this as a union
our children should be protected against this disrespectful exploitation which reduces them to mere toys and leaves them damaged for the rest of their lives
i therefore welcome the council s current proposal and mr kirkhope s report with open arms
harmonising criminal law at european level is quite different from creating european criminal law
another difficult point is the age limit up to which pornography is considered child pornography
i myself am in favour of an age limit of  rather than  years
but the current compromise in which both ages are mentioned without opting for one or the other is confusing
this matter has preoccupied us for a long time too long in my opinion
its importance is demonstrated by the constantly increasing incidence of such delinquency
anyone who does not take action against children and minors being abused and lead astray is jeopardising the future
pornographic material can be distributed via the internet in unlimited amounts and by the most direct route
we welcome the debate on the age limit
actions must follow
mr gollnisch is a fascist delegate in this house who takes advantage of every opportunity not least in this chamber to slander others
this is the type of poison which he spouts here
then it all sounds so wonderful
the reality is that these fine people do not partake in  of the work they spout their poison and then push off
i share the opinion of mr hager that we should also place an obligation on providers
i think this is a worthy point which mr kirkhope should take into consideration in his report
i also expressly support the view that we should not move away from criminallaw liability
we cannot resolve it simply through interpol and more stringent criminal law
the internet as evidenced by child pornography presents totally new challenges to our subjective individual sense of responsibility
we should discuss this in at least as much detail as the tightening of criminal law
the distribution of child pornography on the net is also a criminal offence and so is making child pornography
the distribution of child pornography is facilitated by the internet
not only is the scale of distribution magnified but there is a risk of the offence being trivialised
these are all points underlined by mrs plooij
we pretend that we are all agreed on this but this is not so in practice
in actual fact there is a great deal of resistance
the internet has the aura of progress
and when it comes to harmonising our legislation at european level reference is made to all kinds of grand legal principles
i think that whoever wills the end must also will the means
mr president it is good that we are having this debate on child pornography on the internet
i would like to point out that in actual fact many paedophiles assault children that are close to them
it is not divorce alcoholism or anything else that encourages this behaviour
the internet makes exchanging pictures easier and it is this we should be discussing
however in relation to how the problem has increased there are not enough of them to be able to examine the whole situation
it is therefore a shame that we are immediately about to call in europol
this is a problem
for this is not only an issue within the eu
it is not exclusively in western europe that this issue is being dealt with
the problem with the internet is that the pictures are so clear
older children are at risk of being continuously pursued on the net and of being recognised for ever and a day
mr president commissioner as long as there is a demand for child pornography it will be produced
however as long as this demand exists there will also be abused children scarred for life
i therefore welcome this initiative which was finally put forward so comprehensively by the austrian presidency
above all i welcome the proposals for expanding the initiative which the rapporteur mr kirkhope has made
he has made a major contribution to the instrument which the member states can now take up being more efficient than ever before
i would like to pick up on five points which seem to me to be particularly important in the fight against child pornography
my second point is the age limit
it cannot be set high enough
 is just the first step the target must remain 
my third point is that we need experts in the fight against child pornography on the internet
mr president thank you for the wellreasoned proposal of the rapporteur
the second point concerns telephones because telephone calls can also be made anonymously
then all fax machines should be gotten rid of as quickly as possible  nothing else springs to mind
as the internet ignores national boundaries those tracking down internet crime must also be able to cross them
international cooperation therefore has to be encouraged as much as possible
it was jointly organised by the austrian and united states governments and the commission under the stop programme
the conference adopted conclusions and recommendations that are being actively followed up
we should bear in mind that the key role must be played by selfregulation and by the individual responsibility of those who use the internet
the commission has long been concerned about child pornography on the net
the council and parliament adopted it on  january 
we are convinced that agreements on common definitions common charges and common sanctions need to be established for certain forms of crime
a proposal for a framework decision on common definitions common charges and common sanctions will be put forward after the summer
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
european refugee fund
all refugees begin with a dream of returning home
for some this becomes a reality but for others the period in exile proves to be so long that returning home is unrealistic
it is also of significant help to those who subsequently return home
it may in fact prove to be a prerequisite of successful repatriation
i do not therefore understand why some people want to distinguish between displaced persons and refugees
it is not about relative numbers but actual numbers
but because the task is a considerable one and because it has been unfairly distributed it is naturally sad that the fund in question should be so small
we are talking about eur  million to cover the fixed expenses of the current work distributed among  member states
in addition there is of course some uncertainty about the fund s financial future
all in all however the european refugee fund is in fact to be regarded as a start
i was very excited when i read the commission s proposal
the commission is obviously on the right track
it is important that the financial responsibility for refugees be distributed among member states
however the committee on budgets is raising two objections
firstly no consideration is given to the financial regulation
indeed the programme is multiannual whilst the financial calculations have only been made for one year
the second objection is more extensive
the member states will however need to set up all kinds of structures and procedures in order to share out the money
the committee on budgets therefore suggests that the present proposal with the amounts quoted could be considered as an experiment a very commendable experiment at that
but a real european refugee fund will cost a great deal more than that
the commission is on the right track
we should not therefore get distracted by restrictions upon the financial perspective as long as the net result is to be positive
so the proposed review process becomes essential
asylumseekers are not a burden but a responsibility
the european union member states are the chosen destination of comparatively few compared with the world s poor countries such as those in africa
not to take such an approach would be shortsighted as others have already pointed out
we also want it to be a duty for the committee assisting the commission to consult with other organisations
how we deal with the dispossessed is an issue for society as a whole not just for governments
the asylum policy urgently needs a european approach
as europeans we do not want that sort of policy
we most certainly do not want one country to shift its responsibility to another
setting up this fund is therefore a step in the right direction
it provisionally brings the desired solidarity within the european union symbolically into focus
it is only right that the countries which do a great deal per capita of the population should be the first to receive financial support
this is also the thrust of the amendment tabled by my group
subsequently the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers
i suggest including these two values in an algebraic formula a task which i pass on to the officials with pleasure
the tasks supported by the fund are covered in the proposal and by the rapporteur
we are extremely pleased with the broad support for our concept of tailormade solutions
displaced persons on the other hand have been driven out en masse and against their will and want to return to their home country
for them it is important to optimise their chance of repatriation with dignity
in this respect amendment no  deals with refugees while amendment no  focuses on displaced persons
we should really spell this out a little more clearly
in my opinion  and this is my personal opinion  integration should also include the recognition of the religions of the new minorities
i have been informed that the european commission is carrying out a comparative study into the asylum policy of the member states
i am very curious to see whether this report will be published before long
it could in itself contribute towards the common policy based on best practices
this seems very bad policy on the part of the netherlands
i also want to congratulate the rapporteur mrs frahm on the handling of this important topic and i hope that she will accept my efforts in the field of tailormade solutions for what they mean as regards on the one hand refugees and on the other displaced persons
mr president my group welcomes this proposal
a precondition for this is that the various factors must be given due consideration in allocating the money
mass refugee situations require special measures and separate budgetary allocations
only in this way can routine longterm measures also be maintained
mr president in denmark pernille frahm and her party have led the way in the struggle against what they call more union 
to cap it all she wants more money transferred from the national refugee councils to their eu equivalent
i agree
we saw the need during the war in kosovo
just imagine if a great many more kosovars could have been helped in neighbouring macedonia and albania
they would have much preferred this than to have been sent thousands of kilometres away to distant countries
if there are any who stand united on this issue they are pernille frahm s and my own party
the report shows the extent to which parliamentary activity can be beneficial to europe
we therefore support these motions
we shall here mention only three points
firstly if there is one point on which the report is not satisfactory it is financial resources
these are huge tasks requiring amounts far greater than those initially planned
it would be a serious mistake to exclude the very women and men who often with their invaluable experience make good the omissions of the state from the process
it is only this advance which will make it possible to allow this european fund to make a proper impact
i nonetheless agree with mrs frahm about one thing namely that eur  million is far far too low a level
in denmark alone the level of aid is eur  billion per year so that the present little fund is of absolutely no effect

i also do not support your proposals for measures which are incompatible with the particular groups
when it comes to refugees the measures should be different to those for displaced persons
that contradicts the basic intention
please do so in implementing the measures which are necessary and positive
furthermore her report expresses this parliament s pleasure
for us the establishment of this fund is good news
since  we have been trying to carry out coherent work in this respect and we have had some successes
those are three different areas of work
the member states have a major role to play in this respect and must make considerable efforts
furthermore using the practices already developed for the management of those funds could promote interaction between them
we must develop policies which are coherent with both funds
lastly i would like to add my voice to those which have called for a greater financial contribution to the european refugee fund
mr president firstly i would also like to thank the rapporteur mrs frahm for this excellent and extensive report
however as she herself did i would like to point out a few problems which in our opinion are still important and which need to be remedied
in practice the countries which take in the greatest number of refugees will probably receive the most funds
we must also deal with the actual money to be allocated which must be in proportion to the stated objectives
financing must be ensured up to 
so far the balance sheet has not made any clear statement for the period after 
this proposal raises many questions
are member states themselves no longer capable of managing the refugees they receive in normal circumstances
how would their situation be improved by giving money to brussels only to have brussels immediately give it back to them
will some countries be net contributors and others net recipients and if so which
the answers to these questions cannot be found anywhere in the reports passed on to us
we cannot even find a statistical table of the numbers of refugees currently residing in the various countries of europe
once again we are being asked to take an important decision while being kept in the dark
this is a pernicious effect which insurers are familiar with
the two situations are quite different and require different responses
to confuse them would be to give way to populist rhetoric
you know better than i do that the proposed council decision on this fund was adopted by the commission on  december 
we are setting up a european refugee fund for an initial period of five years
the total appropriation for  is eur  million which includes eur  million for emergency aid
this is i feel an initial step in the right direction
i am perfectly willing to look into any practical solutions but it is not enough to simply state the principle
a practical solution must be found and i have to tell you that that is no easy matter
in this respect it provides an initial response to the request made by the european council in tampere
implementation monitoring followup and assessment arrangements are based on the existing conditions for structural funds
the commission cannot however go along with other sets of amendments particularly those on budgetary methods
this is an initial experiment with a decentralised asylumrelated programme
the competent national administrations are by no means familiar with these procedures
finally with regard to the amendments for cooperation with candidate countries i think we must be quite clear on this
the fund is intended to contribute to balancing member state efforts
these modest enough resources should not be watered down further by the inclusion of secondary objectives
in conclusion mr president the commission is delighted to see the european parliament support this initiative
thank you very much mr vitorino
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
electronic money institutions and credit institutions
the common position reflects a compromise that has been reached after long negotiations in the council
as rapporteur i have tried to avoid pushing the directive to the conciliation procedure
i made a compromise proposal which unfortunately was not accepted in my political group
that would mean that the situation would remain uncertain from the consumers point of view
they are all the amendments proposed by the ecb which were unanimously rejected by the council
we have to keep in mind that the ecb has no right of veto when it comes to european community legislation
amendments nos  and  add the words at par value to the report
these additional words are not absolutely necessary as article  sets out the terms for redeemability
in this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer
for example the waiver could be used for university campus payment cards or for local transport systems
all these cases are also subject to a maximum storage amount of no more than eur 
in addition the waived schemes will not benefit from the single market passport provisions
these limited schemes are not likely to have any spillover effects which could endanger financial market stability
waived institutions would therefore always be registered and monitored by the supervisory authorities
amendments nos   and  reduce the scope of the waiver
the commission took a similar view
the sooner the directive is adopted and implemented the sooner the improved regulation will take effect
if this still raises concerns in practice then the article  review clause is available in reserve
mr president at present there is no requirement for supervision of national emoney schemes
we therefore welcome the directive
we also welcome the fact that there are no exemptions to the changeback obligation
what are we talking about here
what effects will these comprehensive exemption provisions have on currency stability
under certain circumstances could the extensive nature of these exemption provisions not lead to circumventions thus making the exception the rule
we will monitor this
we must ensure of course that we in europe also increase our competitiveness in this area visavis the united states
it has to be said that electronic money in the european union today enjoys rarity value rather than common usage
this must change
i think that we should do something about this if we want to promote this means of payment in future
we must also do it in the interests of consumers because costs will be saved
i therefore think that article  which provides for an extension of the conditions for exemption creates excessive discretionary powers
this could result in many electronic money institutions not being affected by the regulations applicable to credit institutions
the council s amendments which extend the scope of money cannot be in the interest of the consumer
we need electronic money which is valid in a given environment
for this reason it must cover the entire european area and not just a national area
i also think that institutions issuing emoney should be treated as equal
it is of course also important to consider the role of the european central bank  controlling the amount of money in circulation for example
however i am thinking primarily of consumers
even if emoney can be used without limit on the internet and for mobile telephones this does not mean that it might not be counterproductive
for this reason i cannot support the new wording of article c
that is very regrettable
mr president as from january  the euro has been the new currency for most of the european union
it is important that consumers are reassured in relation to electronic payments by establishing a legal framework
this survey also showed that consumers are still charged a lot more for making crossborder transfers than they are for making national transfers
this does not make sense
euro currency has removed exchange rate risks and costs should have reduced substantially
i welcome the directive on crossborder credit transfers which is now in force within the union
in conclusion i strongly believe that the new directive on crossborder transfers is good news for the consumers of the union
it is also good news for financial institutions
mr president like some of the previous speakers this evening i am very pleased the council came forward with this proposal
i do not think that it will be helped by the amendments being proposed inside this parliament today and indeed in our committee
be in no doubt about that this legislation would fall
mr president may i begin by expressing the heartfelt thanks of the commission for the work that has been done by mrs kauppi
may i however express the commission s disappointment that mrs kauppi s initial report could not be accepted
it means that emoney must be redeemed for cash on request minus any deductions for legitimate costs in carrying out the transactions
it seems to me that is a perfectly reasonable position
the recognition of allowing the deduction of reasonable costs conflicts with an obligation to redeem at par value
on this basis and for this reason i cannot regrettably accept the first two amendments
these provisions are optional they are limited in their application to specific identifiable schemes and they are on a case by case basis
may i add that schemes which benefit from any waiver will not benefit from the european passport
therefore the justification for their deletion on the basis of monetary policy concerns is unfounded
they continue to report to the competent authorities on a periodic basis
in other words in the whole process not an iota of money is created
emoney does not mean that money is created
therefore i should like to lay these apprehensions to rest
there is no possibility that monetary instability will arise from the phenomenon of emoney
we want those rules
we want them to be harmonised not least because the citizens of the european union want that
the commission is committed to a review which will take place three years after the coming into force of the directives
regrettably therefore i cannot accept amendments nos  or 
as far as the commission is concerned we would like them to be rejected by parliament in the same way as amendments nos  and  will hopefully be rejected
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
animal nutrition inspections
this is most certainly the case for all legislation related to food safety either directly or indirectly
there are ample examples to prove this
scandals can have a cleansing effect
this is also evident today as we scrutinise the amendment to directive  at second reading
citrus pulp is used as a feed for dairy cows and this is how dioxin ended up in milk for public consumption
the scandal taught us that the commission did not have the means to act forcefully in emergencies
as a result the commission presented at the request of the member states a proposal to amend the present directive on  november 
as early as  december of that same year parliament assented to this proposal without tabling one single amendment
after the treaty of amsterdam came into effect the commission immediately changed the legal basis of  a to 
on  november last the council laid down the present common position
the council made a few editorial changes which were not a problem for us at the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy
this legislation offers us various procedures for transferring the powers of the council to the commission
the council would now like to do away with it in its common position and replace it by the regulatory procedure
after the citrus pulp scandal the member states themselves requested that the commission should act
i am of the opinion that we should give the commission the opportunity to act swiftly
the council will then have  days to change supplement or even reverse this decision
if the council fails to act during these  days the measures enacted by the commission will then lapse
we should all bear in mind that this dossier is only an intermediate step
it immediately drew lessons from the dioxin crisis
mr president i am in favour of adopting the four amendments tomorrow and thus giving the commission our full support
we should join forces with the commission against the council and move towards a conciliation procedure
the rapporteur mr staes has mentioned some here
who is protecting us and who is providing the safeguards
this report has been adopted unanimously in committee and will therefore be supported by all groups
the original commission proposal has thus been readopted by us
we consider that it is absolutely imperative that in urgent cases we can act rapidly
the commission must be given the necessary powers here as guardian of the treaties
i do not think we need a new committee we already have the permanent animal nutrition committee
in germany we have a saying which runs when i don t know what to do next i appoint a committee
too many committees cause delays and ultimately confusion
we must use the existing facilities and use them efficiently
europe and the internal market can only exist if they are also accepted by the citizens and the consumers
for this they need confidence and confidence only comes through openness and transparency
the scandals which we have all discussed show that transparency and openness are becoming more and more important
finally i must sincerely thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and balanced report
mr president the rapporteur said in his introduction that crises have a cleansing effect
i listened to him and hope that what he said is right
he is evidently more optimistic than i am i do not really think that crises have a purifying effect
such is life
it would be nice if he could be made aware of this but that is probably unlikely
this means that the institutions who are not always in agreement were on this occasion agreed
and what has the council learnt from this
it was not this parliament and only to a very minor extent the commission
it was the council of ministers who tried repeatedly to keep things under wraps
so what has it learnt from the bse crisis
has it learnt that it is better to be transparent
has it learnt that it is better to permit safeguard options and safeguard clauses
has it learnt that rapid action is needed
it has learnt none of these things
it has submitted to us a common position in which the option to have a safeguard clause will actually be taken away from the commission
it will not have the option to get involved quickly and unbureaucratically on the basis of safeguard clauses
it will also not have the option to make unannounced onthespot inspections
it is better to leave things in the hands of the agriculture ministers



mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i do not have time to philosophise in just one minute
animals are just the first link in the chain which leads ultimately to human beings
but our impression is that the council does not see this
i particularly appreciate the good collaboration with parliament in this case
already at first reading parliament fully supported the commission s proposal
the proposal aims at improving control measures in the field of animal nutrition
it intends to harmonise inspection procedures for all products imported from third countries
the proposal also extends the legal basis to carry out onthespot inspections both in member states and in third countries
the possibility for the commission situations to react quickly in emergency cases even before consulting member states is a landmark question
the discussion in the present case constitutes an important precedent for the future
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  noon
food additives other than colours and sweeteners
 fr mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we are now going to discuss a second aspect of the food safety issue
when i say more and more  you only have to look at the figures
a survey of the current situation shows that  additives are authorised within the european union
we are effectively working with a positive list
all the additives given on this list are authorised any not included are by the same token prohibited
i am thinking in particular of the problem of allergies
what is being proposed today
in principle there are three criteria governing the acceptance of a new additive technological need usefulness for the consumer and harmlessness
it must be acknowledged that in the course of time technological need has always been the predominant criterion
the situation must therefore be reviewed from a different perspective to the one we took a few years ago
of the commission s nine proposals we think that five are suspect for one reason or another
i shall mention them quickly
firstly an additive called sodium alginate is proposed for use on grated carrots
the usefulness for the consumer is that the grated carrots will appear to be fresh even though they are actually not
this is quite clear just from reading the relevant literature
it is not therefore necessarily to be recommended
there is another additive which presents a huge problem e
e is problematic in terms of assessing its harmlessness because it contains extremely dangerous impurities
we must consequently reject this one too
finally three other additives are proposed as propellants
these are inflammable gases  butane isobutane and propane
that is a brief overview of the problem
as we are not absolutist we consider that they may be accepted
the commission has announced a radical revision of the directive
i have counted around fifty of these myself
others should be used far less widely
i am thinking for example of nitrites nitrates and sulphites which are known to present proven health problems
mr president the way in which we feed ourselves is an expression of how we live
some people criticise what i would call the modern western lifestyle rightly or wrongly
the answer to this question is often determined by the choices we make
as far as additives are concerned the basic rules are enshrined in the  framework directive
to assess whether the use of additives is necessary the framework directive lists various accepted objectives
one of these is the supply of ingredients or components of foodstuffs to patients with dietary needs
the use of e   i will not attempt to pronounce the full word  as proposed by the commission seems to meet this requirement
finally the framework directive also stipulates that facilitating the manufacture and preparation of foodstuffs is an acceptable criterion of usefulness
i would like to add the following if you will allow me
secondly the effects on public health must obviously be assessed on a scientific basis
for this purpose we call on the scientific committee for food for scientific opinions
we cannot do a bit of both
fourthly and on a final note i would like to say a few words on the hierarchy of standards
we have asked for a hierarchy of standards in the igc report and we have also mentioned this elsewhere
to top it all we are in fact aware that a large number of them are harmful and yet we still allow them to be used
i think that community policy in relation to the use of additives has developed in a quite irresponsible way
i should therefore like to support mr lannoye s report i think a splendid piece of work has been carried out
new additives ought to be refused and any increase in the quantity of accepted and permitted substances should be rejected
instead i think the commission needs seriously to rationalise the number of additives
in my opinion the quantities of these compounds that are permitted are way too excessive
nitrosamine is a carcinogenic substance which is derived from and produced by nitrates and nitrites
i think we have a serious problem in this regard and i hope he will confirm that this will be done
finally i would say that in my view we need quite a thorough rationalisation of the quantity of additives in our foodstuffs
this means that the commission suggests supplementing the list with additives which have not yet been used
it does not however mean deleting any additives from the list
in terms of food and food safety the needs and wishes of the consumer need to be given more consideration than has been the case in the past
it does mean however that food safety must be at the top of the agenda
whilst many additives are harmless this does not mean that they all are
and if harmlessness has not been established  there is no doubt that the only correct way forward is to ban the use of the product
in addition it is useful to get manufacturers to spell out the benefit of adding substances for the consumer
what consumer interest is served by doing this
what is in the interests of the consumer differs from one consumer to another and from one consumer group to the next
but what is clear is that all consumers benefit from sound consumer information so that they are not misled
this report literally takes a refreshing look at the problem and not before time
the rapporteur is to be congratulated on this and the report can count on the support of the liberal group
mr president naturally we too wish to congratulate our colleagues
mr lannoye has done an excellent job indeed he has achieved what the commission failed to
i also fail to see what the commission promised ie transparency
i would also like to once again stress what mr lannoye has said
this report makes clear that we need a reform of additives
we cannot place hundreds of additives on the market simply because industry wants it
it has nothing to do with competition that we reject what the commission is proposing
industry will then have to decide the ones it wants
that would at least be an innovative viewpoint which makes competition the basis
mr lannoye is right that we must lay our cards on the table in this regard and do justice to the precautionary principle
as is well known there are three prior conditions which must be fulfilled if additives are to be included on the positive list
there should be a technological need the product should be useful to the consumer and there should be documentary proof of its being harmless
it is also very unfortunate that the synergy effect has not been investigated
the commission also states that it wishes to guide consumers as best it can so that they themselves can make a choice
current liberalisation of the quantity of permitted additives is worrying
let us therefore have the list shortened as soon as possible rather than extended
the answer was unfortunately no and in common with mr lund i should like to see that no justified here today
the additive i am thinking of in this regard is ethylhydroxyethylcellulose
this substance is no luxury and it is not addictive
ethylhydroxyethylcellulose is particularly suitable for the kind of bread traditionally made in the northern region of the eu
the substance is therefore not completely exchangeable for other already approved types of cellulose
however i maintain that in reality the opposite may be true
if children are careless about their diet there is an increased risk of malnutrition
these families cannot buy their bread but have to make it themselves and add the binding agent themselves
why should we make life even more difficult for these families
why should they not be allowed to continue to use the binding agent that they are used to using
in this case it is not possible to invoke the precautionary principle in order to ban the substance
on the contrary the precautionary principle favours the approval of ethylhydroxyethylcellulose
mr president like everyone else in this debate i should like to congratulate mr lannoye
he has done a service to the committee and also to this house by pointing out that this procedure appears to be almost always oneway
i am prepared to accept that some of these are harmless
indeed the committee and even mr lannoye were prepared to accept e and e
these are apparently needed by manufacturers because they produce an equal spray of fat on the utensil concerned
one of them is there only for professional use
the other two are regarded as safe for all
it does not seem to us to be the right place for it
we would prefer to strike out recital  and we shall so vote
this is the place to discuss the burden of proof rather than the overall principle of precaution
but its meaning remains crystal clear
at the end of the line it is for the consumer that this is being done
it is being done in the consumer s name
for that reason we commend amendment no 
in this respect the lannoye report provides one more classic example
the total of  additives authorised by the european union only  of which are completely harmless as paul lannoye has just pointed out
who stands to gain from the inclusion of additives of chemicals in our meals
certainly not the consumers who are now increasingly looking to find  healthy food for themselves and for their children
in this respect without going into the technical details i should like to go back over the three criteria highlighted in the report
on the one hand do the additives meet a technological need
the least that can be said is that consumer interests are not always in line with the interests of manufacturing firms
on the other hand are the additives useful to the consumer
the question answers itself
finally is it certain that the additive is harmless
that is the prime consideration
i promise mr president to be extremely brief
firstly i have an initial comment to make on the scientific committees
it is not sufficient commissioner simply to read the conclusions of the scientific committees you must read the report as i have done
occasionally reading the reports gives rise to more doubts than certainties
they have never been studied together they are studied in isolation and that is an aspect that you must take into consideration
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
the sitting closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
i rise therefore to question whether rule  of our rules of procedure is being applied correctly
as you know we spend an enormous amount of time voting on tuesday wednesday and thursday lunchtimes
we adopted a set of changes to the rules of procedure last year to try to rationalise our work
over  of these amendments are contradictory so they cannot possibly all be the position of the epp group
some are identical tabled by different members and there is even a case of two identical amendments being tabled by the same member
could the epp group please get its act together
i would ask the sessional services to verify in future that such amendments really are in the name of a group
applause from the left
he should be quite clear about that procedure within our group
secondly as he is aware there is a process going on at the moment for reforming parliament
if he has any suggestions to put to the bureau about the voting procedures that would be the correct way to go about it
mr president i was present yesterday and i signed the register but my name does not appear in the minutes
i should like that to be corrected
it shall be done mrs mcnally
mr president i have a request every member has a very precise timetable
we agree on a great number of deadlines in the citizens interest
today yet again the sitting has been brought forward this time to  am
thank you for your understanding
mr rubig look upon it as an exceptional decision taken in response to specific requests from the portuguese presidency
the minutes were approved
mr president on a point of order
it concerns a reference made yesterday by the president on the change of business which is taking place this week
applause from the right
i will pass on your comments to the president mr kirkhope
vote on request for urgent procedure
it is planned for our agenda in may
we can leave this until next month
parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure
 discharge budgetary control
these measures relate mainly to four areas which still require clarification or the oftquoted fresh start
fourthly reports must be filed on the relevant disciplinary hearings and fundamental reforms implemented
parliament takes the control function assigned to it in the european treaties seriously
all the measures called for must be carried out by the deadline set
all the cases are awaiting a decision
despite countless lofty announcements there is as yet no real evidence of a fresh start
decentralisation must not result in the total de facto abolition of internal financial control
you see good old goethe had the right words even in this situation
mr president ladies and gentlemen we have a number of difficult decisions to take this week
controlling the executive is one of parliament s main rights and that right centres on budgetary control
our yardstick must therefore be the central issue of what the new commission s attitude is towards responsibility
a good example of this in my view is the discharge for the development funds
our committee had confidential information on mismanagement and irregularities which amounted to suspicion of corruption
in response to our questions we received only inadequate information for which we had to wait a long time
the majority of the committee therefore decided to suspend discharge in order to obtain more information
in the meantime however we have good news to impart
i think that this development clearly demonstrates the direction that we need to take
unfortunately i was forced to include another postponement in my report this time in relation to the economic and social committee
there are again problems with the economic and social committee in relation to travel costs and mission expenses
it took the committee over  months to refer justified cases of suspicion of fraud to olaf
discharge therefore had to be suspended pending the results of the olaf investigation
there is another problem with the economic and social committee the problem of buildings
we are still paying rent for the ardenne and ravenstein buildings
however i should just like to say on the subject of buildings that better management is needed at european level
there are similar problems with the european court of justice
the court of auditors has drafted a special report on this subject which will be reflected in the  discharge procedure
as a new member allow me to point out that there are serious shortcomings in this area
as i have little time left i should like to give a very succinct and concentrated presentation of the rest of my report
we are able to propose that the european court of justice and the european court of auditors be granted discharge
we are also able to propose that the dublin agency and the thessaloniki agency be granted discharge
however we would like to see the contradictory procedure shortened for the agencies
we welcome the fact that the agencies have decided to carry out an evaluation and we expect this evaluation to be submitted by december 
i should like to report quite unequivocally that neither applies
there has been no whitewash
in addition contrary to the commission discharge procedure we have no cause to complain that we did not receive certain documents
some were perhaps a little late in arriving but they did all arrive
that is another difference in the discharge procedures
i am all in favour of the same yardstick but the same yardstick does not necessarily give the same results
i should like to come now to the question of where the shortcomings which we must clear up lie
we must for example reverse the trend whereby the number of direct contracts has increased dramatically in comparison with the number of open competitions
this refers mainly to the fixtures and fittings in this building
it is not a procedure which is illegal per se and it would be wrong to assume that it were
however we must insist that this trend be reversed in order to reinstate a sound administrative culture
this direct contract procedure must not catch on and become the predominant procedure
another important point addressed relates to the question of buildings
we have already discussed them at length
we have received every document written on the subject
the inventory has been addressed
mr seppanen addressed it yesterday
the report itself lists the difficulties which have arisen the huge number of items which have disappeared or to put it bluntly been stolen
in the meantime thank god we have introduced an electronic inventory system in parliament
we are now waiting for an explanation as to how this electronic system functions
i should like to come back to the question of yardsticks and results
i hope i do not have to sit in such a parliament
we are pleased to note that this has meanwhile been rectified
so what exactly were parliament s requirements
this has since been done and we are grateful for this
this is moving in the right direction
this may also partly be due to the fact that agricultural policy has changed over the years
i believe it is easier to keep income policy in check than it is price policy
there has since been an increase in expenditure for development within rural areas but i will come back to this
special attention should also be paid to the european revenue
what does the committee on budgets mainly want
in my opinion we should be able to have a  error rate within a number of years
one way of achieving this is to establish an estimated reliability level for each sector
this is something which the commission could undertake itself
in this way the various offices will benefit from a healthy rivalry
everyone wants to outstrip the others and agriculture would be able to take the wind out of the sails of the other budget components
i think it is about time this stopped
we think the commission should come up with proposals to actually apply the financial corrections system to structural expenditure for agriculture
the committee on budgets therefore recommends discharge
there are however a few problems remaining one of which i have already mentioned namely export refunds
we are expecting a report on this
finally and i may come back to this at a later stage we are waiting for a report from the court of auditors on the flechard affair
we can grant discharge to the commission without these three elements
there is something else
since  there has been a conciliation committee for agricultural expenditure
we have as yet to be convinced of the usefulness of this conciliation body
the commission has promised to assess this
we have decided to give the discharge on three conditions and the conditions are clearly spelt out
we hope that by  august those concerned will give us the information that is requested
such investments can and should be made by professional banks rather than the little outfit that we have at the moment
the number of people employed for the amount of money being invested is again quite disproportionate
far too often in the past we have found that promises have been made and not kept
so i hope that the answers will be given to parliament and to the committee on budgetary control
i think that is about all i need to say
on that basis i recommend to this house a discharge
i have what is more received no complaints from any officials at all
i should however like to make two observations
in this context it is essential to prevent a climate of political vendetta arising between the main institutions of the union
my personal preference would be for adopting a more selfcritical attitude
mr president ladies and gentlemen expenditure for research accounts for nearly two thirds of the budget for internal policy
the committee on industry external trade research and energy regrets the inaccuracies in one third of payments
what does the commissioner intend to do about this
has the commission ever taken legal action
or does it intend to
i would like to have these questions answered
the success and usefulness of the research programmes are beyond dispute
but effective implementation requires better management and coordination as well as inspections carried out by various directoratesgeneral
we are prepared to grant discharge under these conditions
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen alas i sit here between a rock and a hard place
it is not enough for the present commission to acknowledge the errors of the old commission without finding a solution
however this is not the place for such personal experiences
allow me rather to highlight the causes for criticism as the representative and draftsman of the rett committee
firstly certain measures dating back to before  have still not been completed
secondly the irregularities identified by the court of auditors refer mainly to errors in relation to proof of expenditure which are signed by member states and for which they are responsible
the conditional postponement of the discharge suggested by mrs stauner is to be welcomed
to our great delight we are also at the dawn of a drastic reform of development policy
in terms of inspection this is all undoubtedly neatly justified in accounts but is incorrect in terms of content
this poverty focus is essential in order to actually get value for money
then there is still the staffing problem
in the light of this there is a great need for reform on this score
i would like to underline the confidence we have in the commission and all its commissioners
today we are debating the discharge for the  financial year
the court of auditors did not grant the commission an auditor s certificate establishing that payments had been implemented in a lawful and proper manner
the error rate was considered to be too high by the court of auditors
nearly  of all errors identified or highlighted by the court of auditors concern the member states
overall there was a clear drop in the error rate for the funds in comparison with previous years
however this gives the commission no cause whatsoever for complacency
you addressed this point mr van den berg
it is therefore essential that we act in unity if european policy is to work
the chairman of the committee on budgetary control mrs theato also has a very responsible role in this respect
the commission has made a commitment to transparency and openness
that must also apply to the commission staff just as it applies to people who belong to the other european institutions and to all our citizens
i should like to thank the committee on budgetary control for this resolution and also for the deadline attached to it
this commission has no fear of any findings
my colleague franz fischler will shortly be going into the question of the agricultural budget in connection with discharge in greater detail
i shall fight for clear rules within the framework of the financial regulation
i am not in a position at this point to go into the individual points of the resolution in detail
this is why the european antifraud office is being reinforced
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to restrict my comments to the socalled mulder and casaca reports
this can also be seen from the financial corrections quoted under number 
i consider this to represent a certain degree of acknowledgement and at the same time to be an order to do even more in the future
i expressly state that i agree with number 
it is also a prerequisite to our being able to reduce the error rate still further
these agencies have all the data on the final beneficiaries and the commission services naturally have unrestricted access to them
the recruitment procedure for the remaining six posts has already been completed or will be shortly
however this is only a consultation process and it is the commission itself which takes the decision in all cases
i can also assure you that refunds and the aid regime for flax and hemp will be examined very conscientiously
corrections totalling eur  million were made to refunds for the financial years from  to 
allow me to conclude with a few comments on the declaration of assurance
it is proposed in the resolution that there should be a separate declaration of assurance for the eaggf and the individual sectors
this question is of course addressed first and foremost to the court of auditors
the commission notes this proposal with interest
and finally my thanks in this respect to the committee on budgetary control for their excellent cooperation in drafting the report
a few words now on mr casaca s report
i should also like to thank you mr casaca for your report
the purpose of the proposed amendment tabled here is to improve controls
i should like to make the following comments on the proposed amendments
and that is what we have done in the committee on budgetary control over recent weeks
we are working on that
mrs schreyer also mentioned it
however i am warning you that the commission is heading straight for the same fate as its predecessor
this includes reappraising old cases
the rapporteur quotes four cases by way of example
here too the commission misunderstands our basic cause for concern
the rapporteur and the committee on budgetary control are not holding the present commission per se responsible for the deplorable state of affairs in previous years
the resignation of the previous commission did not put an end to it
i take this to mean that it must clear up all the old cases without exception and  where necessary  must pass them to the courts
coverups or even sweeping issues under the carpet are not the answer
this approach also informs the white paper on the reform of the commission tabled by mr kinnock
the committee debated them at several meetings and finally adopted them with one vote against
i know mrs schreyer that you have tabled an action plan
nonetheless the error rate has remained at the same high level for the last five years
we shall have to debate this
nonetheless we take the view and the treaty states that the commission is responsible for implementing the overall budget
excuses and promises are no use
we need clear proof of improvement
mr president the committee on budgetary control has considered several reports recently mostly relating to the  discharge procedure
we check their accounts
we ensure that policies have been well managed
the report as it stands at the moment is very different from the initial report that was submitted by mrs stauner on behalf of the epp group
that was clearly used as a political battering ram
mrs stauner quoted goethe
i will quote shakespeare
the report was full of sound and fury signifying nothing
that is why the explanatory statement attached to this report has not been agreed by the budgetary control committee
it makes no sense in the context of the postponement report and it is totally nonsensical and hysterical in tone
we are delighted that there was an almost unanimous consensus however on the new practical approach to the general discharge
we would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation on that
we expect and hope that the commission will deliver and the rapporteur will perhaps take a more considered approach in her final report
this discharge procedure should be an opportunity to study systems failures within the commission
there is a massive amount of expertise in the court of auditors expertise that parliament should draw on in order to reach its own political conclusions
in postponing the discharge we have set out clear points that we expect the commission to act upon
never again will we accept the situation where we cannot get to the bottom of a case because documents have gone missing
clear lines of responsibility must be established so that if problems occur disciplinary action will follow
never again will we accept a situation where misconduct or a bad administrator will be judged by his or her peers
we expect an external element to be included as advised by the committee of independent experts
let us not forget that here we are considering the discharge for 
we do not want witchhunts
we want answers as to how best we spend european taxpayers money
i would like to turn very briefly to the other reports that we have considered in committee and first of all to the kuhne report on the european parliament
mr kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the parliament discharge
there is no doubt that there have been vast improvements in parliament s performance
our financial control system does not have the quantity of payments that the commission has and therefore things are more manageable
if the council had any concern about budget control we certainly would not be sitting in this building right now
there has been a great deal of talk about a report on political group expenditure
the fact is that our committee has not seen this report
it has still not been published officially and therefore it is difficult for us to comment on it
but transparency is a principle that we must hold dear in this context
i am delighted that mrs ruhle has done such a great job on the edf report
mr mulder has done a great job as well displaying his usual wizardry with the eaggf accounts
we certainly do not expect the council to support our position on the casaca report
we are voting for postponement on many accounts
the important reports of course will come next
we hope that we will be able to develop a better approach in the next part of this discharge procedure
it is important that we find a new way of doing it
thank you mr president for all your kind support over the years for the budgetary control committee
it is always greatly appreciated
as far as the stauner report is concerned the liberal group is able to support the compromise resolution
in common with mrs theato we hope that everything will be signed sealed and delivered before the summer
i should add that we as a group have less appreciation for the explanatory note which the rapporteur has added to her own resolution
this was already mentioned last night
in our opinion an explanation should reflect the resolution itself and should not include any new elements
i would like to make a brief comment on the report by mr kuhne
we too have a great deal of appreciation and admiration for the way in which mr kuhne has drafted his report
if we are to criticise the commission we should perhaps make sure that we have put our own house in order first
i would now like to come back to the stauner report and a number of points made in it
the court of auditors will shortly be publishing a report on the socalled flechard affair
a few things are already clear however irrespective of the fraud affair itself
the documents disappeared everywhere simultaneously
the big question to the commission is what has it since done on this score
secondly we would like proportionality explained
should large businesses pay larger fines than small businesses
thirdly where does the commissioners responsibility lie
to what extent can officials decide some things for themselves
this is an extremely political issue
the following general rule will need to apply to this commission the error rate is too high
it is not enough to say that it should come down
then parliament would know where it stood
the commission would then have a goal to work towards and we could market ourselves better to the general public
this is what it is all about at the end of the day
europe s ideal needs to be preserved
we must restore the public s lost confidence in the european institutions
we must reestablish confidence and that means that as a committee we must make a critical examination of the  budget
our yardstick was how responsibility and transparency were dealt with and requires an open approach to shortcomings and an open approach to mistakes
we hope that the action plan will help the administration to achieve better management
the questions of the award of contracts buildings and staff are at issue
we know all about the pressure of time up to the point of discharge
the report by the financial controller for example was submitted relatively late
obviously it was not possible to submit this action plan in time for today s decision
i must also highlight something else since mr kuhne appeared to be hinting that a hushup would be in the groups interest
we need clearcut criteria and clearcut guidelines
mr president it says budg  discharge on the notice board but it should say cont
perhaps this could be corrected because budgets and budgetary control are always getting confused
it is the question of control which is at issue here
it would be difficult to confuse them mrs theato but in any event we will try to correct it on the screen
they tell me that it has to be written with a limited number of digits
we will try to find a formula which will make it clear that we are talking about the cocobu
perhaps ccb would be useful since this is the formula used in other bodies
mr president the european union lacks moral authority
that is particularly problematic in matters of finances
to maintain its own selfrespect parliament must accept the rules and regulations for the members forthwith
parliament must investigate the misappropriation of funds by its political groups
our group will not agree that the practice of party aid should be introduced at the taxpayer s expense to cover up such malpractice
parliament must investigate why it was so lax in its vigilance when it came to millions of euros worth of parliament property disappearing
i would remind you how difficult it was in parliament to raise the issue of malpractice on the basis of the accounts of the commission for 
those parliamentary members that compiled the list were obviously right
they are the home guard for the officials that have behaved dishonourably
most of the officials in the eu are diligent and decent people
in this case there is a need for increased vigilance and that is something mr santer s commission was unable to achieve
however postponing the discharge is justified and is the correct course of action in this situation
postponement of the granting of discharge is in itself the result of a quite incredible situation
we have seen an express reluctance to hold those officials to account who are responsible for the circumstances open to criticism
we shall therefore vote against the discharge for parliament s  accounts
if there are no dramatic improvements in the financial administration european taxpayers will know how to react against this irresponsible misuse of their money
the commission must understand that they are not europe s overlords but the servants of european citizens
mrs theato should know that we value her desire to call a spade a spade
this may sound harsh or even simplistic but that is how it is
i have not even mentioned the overlap which exists in a large number of these european credits
national states provide development aid so does europe
national states combat racism so does europe
national states support the women s movement so does europe
national states support the trade unions and parties so does europe
national states support all kinds of third way movements so does europe
and so on and so forth
returning to today s topic i would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs stauner on her report
there is no need to keep on about what is stated quite clearly in black and white in this report
i should also like to complement mrs stauner on a good report
how is it different from the commission which was overturned
are our rapporteurs now getting complete information and full answers in response to their questions
no
have administrative procedures been instigated against those who had their hands in the till or covered up for those who had their hands in the till
no
has mr paul van buitenen been rewarded for his courageous efforts to turn the commission into a responsible organisation no
it is you  who are responsible for the fact that we as members of parliament are still not receiving the information we request
you operate on the principles of absolute monarchy
come out into the open and acknowledge that it is no longer possible to govern with oldfashioned secrecy
admit that you will be replaced if you continue to sweep the dirt under the carpet
and we must apply the same critical standard against ourselves
article  of the treaty requires the commission to take all appropriate steps to act on parliament s observations concerning execution of expenditure
i congratulate all the rapporteurs on the discharges before the house this morning
i have a few comments on mr kuhne s and mrs stauner s reports
firstly on the question of the parliament discharge
if we take the context of this report we will see that it has to stand on its own merits
it is not a question of parallelism it is a question of substance
secondly i turn to mrs stauner s excellent report and the explanatory statement
the explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing
i come to two points here
the first is access to information
why
because parliament and the commission cannot agree about what access we have to information
parliament is not getting the answers it requires
secondly the question of the disciplinary procedure
it is an arbitrary procedure
i am thinking of the case of mr zavvos in particular
therefore we as a parliament should look at each of these cases as it stands
as far as the information policy is concerned i am in full agreement with mr elles
firstly you must ensure that monies paid in error or as in the flechard case sums waived in error are recovered
in other words you must repair the damage to the taxpayer insofar as it can still be repaired
the provisions of the financial regulation on this point do not need to be revised
we need no reforms for the purpose we merely need to apply these provisions otherwise they will remain dead letter
it is obvious that some people have been living in glass houses in brussels for a very long time
our most powerful weapon in this regard is the discharge
in this way we can keep the pressure on and bring about real reform
it is now high time that the council followed our example and searched its own heart
there is no doubt that our discharge resolutions are effective this is borne out by the farreaching reforms which the commission has now undertaken
i would like to illustrate this with a recent example
our pressure has prompted the european commission to undertake drastic reform in foreign policy
i am keen therefore to share with you my initial reaction
but the real political prioritising we need for the purpose of employing our very limited resources is still lacking
unfortunately it has proved impossible so far to take the same drastic steps in this house
the kuhne report is parliament s first report which takes discharge seriously
some claim that the european parliament should be judged by the same stringent measures as the european commission
i do not share this view
in my opinion we should raise the standard for ourselves
we are the controlling body
we have the direct link with the citizen
we are primarily responsible for restoring their confidence in the european project
this is why it is not enough to measure up against the nonelected officials within the commission
we should outstrip them by far unfortunately nothing is further from the truth
i would like to emphatically lay the blame for parliament s bad image with those who have always had a majority
the two large parties are responsible for the ethos of nepotism and underhand dealing which permeates this house
but the small parties too which have mismanaged the party funding have once again put our name in a bad light
the kuhne report will be an important weapon which can be used by those in favour of reform in this house
but whether it will be adopted at this stage remains to be seen
we must think very hard about this so that we can actually restore the citizen s confidence
mr president commissioners ladies and gentlemen do not try to argue that what is wrong is right
that is the attitude we must adopt in this difficult exercise constituted by the annual discharge
mrs theato was right in stating that granting discharge is a serious matter
to grant discharge is when all is said and done to grant a certificate of good management
i am in favour of this approach and as such would like to ask you to adopt mrs stauner s report without any further ado
secondly i would like to comment on the kuhne report
i am not trying to argue that what is wrong is right
i wish to make it absolutely clear here that the kuhne report does not follow this theme
mr kuhne has completed an excellent piece of work
his report incisively denounces what is going wrong in our institutions
mrs morgan told us a moment ago that we do not want witchhunts
but mrs morgan this is not happening
what we denounce is stated quite clearly in the courageous report of our financial controller mr o hannrachain
the complaints are staggering and include a faulty inventory and many thefts
i was a victim of this myself in a previous life when my computer and printer were stolen
secondly there are far too many restricted and private allocations
these should be the exception but we have noticed that in   of the cases were awarded privately
this is no longer the exception


thirdly i would like to mention buildings policy a policy in which decisions are taken stepbystep rather like slicing a salami and which is made up of faits accomplis
the price tag is ffr  million
this is ludicrous
he is blaming us for playing a partypolitical game
well mr kuhne i can assure you that this is not the case
what we are doing is being consistent in our approach however
surely asking for our offices to be treated in the same way as the commission is not a political game
i am delighted to state that mr deprez has adopted the same stance a moment ago
i am delighted to state that mr elles has tabled a similar amendment on behalf of the group of the european people s party and european democrats
i therefore hope to receive more support for our amendment which was completely voted down in the committee on budgetary control
i am now counting on a majority in the plenary meeting
mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs stauner s report which we are discussing today is important in more than one respect
for us to grant discharge without asking the european commission for further details would of course be evidence of weakness on the part of the european parliament
this house would lose face and would discredit itself in the eyes of public opinion in our countries and that is something we do not want
the treaties clearly establish the exclusive competence of parliament in matters of budgetary control
the stauner report deserves every support on this score
we in parliament set high standards for the commission but do we set them for ourselves too
these shady tricks must stop at once
we also need to search our own hearts regarding public tenders
it is unacceptable that the number of privately awarded contracts in  increased to half of all contracts
why such a steep rise
the secretarygeneral has mentioned a few procedural reasons but is this the full story
a clarification regarding this drastic rise is urgently required
rapporteur kuhne also puts his finger on the problems regarding the financing of the spinelli building
this is the umpteenth affair involving new buildings
is it not about time we commissioned an independent inquiry into the decisionmaking process for building projects
we can no longer afford to cover the above issues with the cloak of charity
we need to exert parliamentary pressure to bring about the necessary reforms
furthermore i would like you to look at mrs stauner s report from the most positive point of view possible
all the groups have reached an agreement to raise  questions in relation to certain cases they are not the only ones
we could have mentioned other problems arising from the tacis or phare programmes
i can assure you that you will be able to reply in the affirmative to each of the cases which we are putting to you
therefore between now and the summer we could hold a sitting for the purposes of discharging the accounts
not only are we as interested as you in the discharge of the accounts but in fact we are more so
this is a political debate and you must understand that we need you to act
documents must not disappear
i will give you an additional piece of information
this debate must not concentrate excessively on the accounting issues
it is a general debate
you know that an unknown amount of money is lost through fraud or misappropriation
more resources are lost through lack of motivation than through misappropriation
this is a quality issue which will also have to be increasingly discussed in the context of this debate
of course we must
however we must not compare separate issues
for example the auditor has not detected any irregularity in parliament s budget
we must therefore be prudent and fair and try to treat everyone as they deserve
i will end by saying that you can reply to the  questions we have raised
so far it has not shown much desire to do so
the commission has put the lid on the issue and it has been impossible to obtain the necessary information
the commission maintains that the matters in question do not fall under the  discharge that is not the case
i should like to give an example
it was sent to the commission in november
only in march did i receive an answer in which moreover i was told to take a running jump
excuse me but either the man has been out in the sun too long or he must have some incredibly bad advisers
the commission is obliged to answer our questions irrespective of whether or not it likes the content of these
until they understand this i think we should postpone granting discharge
i hope the commission will take our demands seriously
if they do not we shall be ready to send them on a very long holiday in may
i should like to explain what the echo case is about
what signal is being sent out to present and future leaders of the commission when the people responsible escape indictment
the echo scandal has still not led to any repercussions
the problem is that the echo case is not about property crime
it is about gross negligence and about an official who has taken decisions without regard to the finance regulation
the decision to exonerate the previous director was taken by the previous commission and this was a political decision pure and simple
now the commission has until  may to solve the problem
i also think it is a good idea to look a little more closely at the discharge for the development fund
there are still unresolved demands but if we postpone granting the discharge this will be accompanied by clear demands upon the commission
the commission s delegations have failed
there are several examples of cases where they could have prevented fraud if they had been just a little observant
unfortunately there are too many delegations which are just there for the ride
i have therefore asked permission to prepare an owninitiative report so that we can have these issues clarified
the final thing i want to say is that the commission should undertake to refer the fraud cases to olaf
i obtained  reports under pentagonlike conditions but olaf still does not know anything about these
i look forward to seeing the results
mr president the issue of discharge is an immense one for the institutions of the eu
its importance is evident in the fact that in many cases it is now being proposed that the discharge should be postponed
as the member states that is to say the council has advocated discharge this is almost a matter of structural conflict
apparently the court of auditors should specify the shortcomings and incidences of malpractice in more detail and place less trust in mathematics
although i say this in no way does this diminish the commission s responsibility which is a great one
the reports concerning discharge show just how badly administrative reforms are needed
commissioner kinnock s package of reforms must be pushed through without delay
the main focus is the reform of internal auditing in each of the institutions
administration and auditing must go hand in hand to preserve a sense of personal responsibility and help it grow
the present system in which it takes various signatures to authorise payments does away with the notion of personal responsibility
it is totally impossible to find anyone who will take responsibility
improving the quality of administration is a basic requirement for a greater sense of responsibility and better efficiency
increased control is only a reflection of the fact that the organisation has failed
the main financial difficulties focus on the largest budgetary category agriculture
mr president over the last few days we have read in the press that the european parliament is a haven for thieves
this is both embarrassing and distasteful
we must act in such a way that eu property is treated with the same respect as other property
in this connection we must check up on the matter of parliamentary administration
in the eu budget this year there is an appropriation of eur   set aside for an investigation into parliamentary administration
according to the budget this investigation will be given to an independent expert
what has happened to this investigation why has it not got under way and what is going to be done about it
i was perfectly aware of its importance
the court of auditors highlighted a series of shortcomings in the research area in 
there is the old case of visiting scientist b and how his contract came into being
at the same time there was the socalled european nuclear affair
we might be satisfied with some of the explanations that the commission offers for these incidents
as are we
i call on the commission to immediately give us satisfactory answers which stand up in public
then everyone will have a true picture
questions can hurt
we asked them because mistrust and criticism have been spreading since the refusal of the  discharge
but what matter are the results which will be presented on  may
mr president representatives of the commission ladies and gentlemen the discharge procedure is a complicated exercise
i am thinking of the structural funds for the things already achieved and the financial regulation for the things already achieved
the content and the arguments presented in other more specific reports provide no more justification for postponement of discharge
in this specific situation it would seem that the current discharge procedure would be a perilous exercise
should this not require giving a more precise framework to the work of members of parliament within the committee on budgetary control
i shall conclude by mentioning the internal reform of the commission
mr president this is a useful and very necessary procedure
it is necessary to acknowledge that  was properly spent
there is fraud at every level of government at which i have served  local national and european and regional
i thank mrs stauner for her report
some people have criticised it for being a bit too severe
i do not agree with all of it of course but nevertheless it was agreed by a majority
i would not entirely accept the explanatory statement
it is mrs stauner s own explanation but it is the motion for resolution that we the parliament have to decide on
we ought avoid particularly vendettas between an institution and individual commissioners
we also have an obligation to ensure that when we make regulations they are regulations which can be put into effect
we never sought to ensure that our regulations were enforceable
parliament employed its powers in a sound manner under special circumstances
a college of commissioners which has since been appointed has presented an ambitious reform programme
needless to say parliament needs to keep a critical eye on the commission
her motion for a resolution contained damning accusations regarding the commission which as it happens did not even relate to the  budget year
meanwhile the motion for a resolution has been amended drastically and the suggestion was made to postpone the discharge decision
the commission is being given the opportunity of responding to a number of urgent questions raised and requests made by parliament before  may
i would like to single out one point from among these questions and requests
over the past year it has become clear that the commission s disciplinary procedure does not function properly
in countless cases no action was taken or if it was it did not lead to any result
the procedure needs to be completely overhauled
the commission has made suggestions to this effect in its white paper
however these suggestions do not go far enough
parliament supported this proposal in january and does so once again by means of this motion for a resolution
i would ask the commission to reconsider its position
the european parliament s financial situation has been the subject of extensive media coverage over the past few weeks
mr kuhne has drawn up a report on this subject on which i would like to warmly congratulate him
he did not let himself be talked into adjusting his wellbalanced approach in the face of sometimes heated publications
the kuhne report proposes granting parliament discharge provided a number of welldefined requirements are met
for example the offices of parliament are expected from now on to offer in the majority of cases contracts for tender which are public in nature
in addition parliament needs to indicate when the reform process which is being launched within the commission will start taking effect in parliament
one of the key proposals is to separate the audit and financial control functions
the commission has already indicated that it will submit proposals to this effect before the summer
i am of the opinion that such separation should also take place within parliament
this compromise has three distinct advantages over the rapporteur s initial draft
in this respect the report has been improved
these are the three positive features
there are however three forms of sidelong shift which give me pause
the first is that we are forgetting what the discharge procedure consists of
it is paradoxical and even unfair that the report in question makes so little mention of the financial year 
the second shift in emphasis involves the failure to make it clear that the explanatory statement is distinct from the report
how many journalists are aware that the resolution represents the opinion of the house but that the explanatory statement represents only the opinion of the rapporteur
this gives us grounds for concern
we brought the commission down a year ago and we had better not give in to our homicidal impulses again
mr president i shall focus on only one point access to information
many of my colleagues have raised this issue this morning
we need better access in order to move forward
we have asked members of parliament to volunteer to follow budget lines
some services cooperate very well some are setting up briefing meetings for members of parliament  but others are not
what we need from the commission is a new system
a start would be a list of who is responsible for what in which budget lines of each committee
we need to know that money is being spent properly
if we have that confidence we can pass that message on to the public in europe
my colleague mrs morgan spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure
that is right
for too long discharge was seen as something bureaucratic and rather unnecessary  something to get out of the way very quickly
mr president i am speaking here especially in the capacity of rapporteur of the committee on employment and social affairs
first of all i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her report
i would also like to comment on a few points which are included in the report of the committee on employment and social affairs
i would ask the commission to pay more attention to this aspect
secondly i would like to mention the issue of financing
there have been problems recently regarding the payment credits of the social fund in particular
unfortunately these problems have not been solved
this merits further attention too
finally i would like to mention the problem surrounding the leonardo programme
these are the key points which i would like to highlight here
the committee on budgetary control has naturally been unable to adopt all these points in their entirety
secondly we passed punishable offences to the courts in a oneoff show of strength during the last parliamentary term
demanding a new audit without submitting any proof or evidence is hardly going to enhance the credibility of our parliament
mr president i welcome all the reports on the discharge procedures especially mrs stauner s report
it would be very useful if the commission were to release more information to us and give us the reports we ask for
i welcome mrs stauner s report for a number of reasons
these are all relevant nowadays because we must learn the lessons from them
any new proof that arises from these cases must be investigated
these investigations must be very rigorous and must be reported back to us
olaf must use its teeth
the three cases i have mentioned are also quite important because they reflect remarkably on four current commissioners
all four of them must look carefully at their past come clean and show this new commission where reform is needed
i hope that commissioner kinnock listens to this debate and will reflect upon
i also wish to make a couple of points on the kuhne report on parliament s own budget discharge
i welcome the fact that the kuhne report has called for a report on the new inventory system for parliament
i hope the commission takes the time to look at this debate seriously
this parliament is very serious in the way it discharges various budgets
however for now the commission has a number of questions to answer and i hope it will start right now
i should also like to comment on mr blak s question on the questionnaires
there has been a specific procedure for questionnaires in the past
the committee has now changed this albeit informally
the commission then said that it would of course reply to the questionnaire despite the fact that this point was not clarified
that again shows that it really does make sense here to lay down clear procedural rules
i can only say in this context that the procedure changed with the legal basis for olaf
we have to discuss this with the director of olaf
another important point is the question of disciplinary procedure and i should like to comment on this
the commission explained to mr van hulten in its white paper that it would reform this disciplinary procedure as it now stands
nonetheless our reform must remain within the bounds of the european treaty
a multitude of points were made but i should like to comment on the question of the discharge procedure
in fact it was the netherlands which failed to carry the decision on the grounds that the commission should draw up a clear timetable
mr mulder you also returned to this point
it is not a question of reducing control but of making it more efficient
no one must be able to hide behind centralised financial control
it has been clearly stated that the objective must be to reduce the error rate and i can only agree with this
but obviously i cannot reduce the error rates for the  or  budgets in retrospect
on the contrary the objective is to take clear steps to achieve a better result in the future
that is the purpose of the action plan submitted by the commission
i would be glad to comply with this request because i think it too helps clarify matters
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  am
the sitting was suspended at  am and resumed at  noon
vote
i need not add anything further since parliament i am sure will welcome this
the president declared the common position approved as amended
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
before the final vote
ladies and gentlemen the commission supports all the proposed amendments adopted
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
before the vote on the amendments
i am sorry but it is too late
the request was not submitted in time
it has to be made the evening before the votes
the rules are very clear
if we start breaking that rule then it just creates chaos during the votes
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
explanations of votes
staes report a
following the dioxin crisis in may  it was apparent that it was necessary to adapt this legislation
at that time the commission announced a legislative programme with a view to improving food safety regulations
the programme was adopted by the council and by the european parliament and included a revision of directive ec
at the time several problems had been identified
obviously this is extremely reprehensible and even irresponsible
lannoye report a
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on the proposal for the directive amending directive ec
the report clearly expresses consumer concerns in the face of the flood of additives of chemicals into our daily diet
indeed our diet has changed radically under the influence of lifestyle changes and the contributions of new technologies
the time devoted to preparing meals has been reduced considerably
the technological need for the additive to be approved for example is obviously determined by the industry itself which argues primarily in terms of reducing production costs and winning markets
at the moment this criterion is the weightiest consideration
usefulness for the consumer is a particularly vague concept
finally there is the criterion of harmlessness
before any substance may be authorised for use as a food additive it must in principle be subjected to toxicological assessment
there are still loopholes
on the other hand these experiments assess the effect of each substance taken in isolation
our diet however often contains a cocktail of different substances whose combined effect is rarely identified
the precautionary principle must be used with the utmost rigour in matters of foodstuffs
the commission s proposal has not taken adequate account of this principle
kirkhope report a
the danish social democratic members of the european parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the report and fully and wholeheartedly support the initiatives being taken where this is concerned
the internet has created an entirely new situation where the duplication sale and distribution of child pornography is concerned

i must in addition congratulate the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs on its work which produced some very interesting proposals
in addition the report sets the cutoff age at  for the definition of what must be considered to be child pornography
in the same way the idea of the offence of child pornography must be seen as quite comprehensive
without this qualification users surfing the internet and inadvertently accessing a site displaying child pornography would also be punishable
users of child pornography must be punished severely to serve as examples
in addition it is very important to organise better cooperation between member states police forces through europol
the european parliament must make bold proposals and must remain very vigilant
we must utilise all the preventative and restrictive means possible to combat such phenomena
this proposal is a step in this direction and i can therefore only give it my support

the twentyfirst century is the century of communications
within the vast internet market there are some people who have found ways to make easy money from exploiting human poverty
and yet this house is indignant today at child pornography as if it were not all part of the continuum
some people will retort as they often do that it has always existed and will always exist
what a fatalistic comment and what resignation what contempt for the human condition
frahm report a
but what additional contribution is this fund going to make exactly in comparison with the present situation
this money is not really heavensent of course it is taken away from those selfsame citizens without their being aware of it
europe is thus creating a good reputation for itself on the cheap
at the end of  the commission proposed a community action programme with a view to promoting the integration of refugees within the union
this represents a clear improvement on prevalent practice to date
as is often the case this allocation is inadequate to handle the actual requirements
in order to obtain real results the budget for this fund must be increased
the fund which is merely the product of a combination of three budgetary lines will not do this
an approach whereby immigrants entering the eu in search of protection are seen as a burden which has to be distributed is fundamentally flawed
the fund will not in this form cause any country to switch to a policy of greater openness towards the immigration of refugees
nor will it improve the legal security of persons fleeing persecution and in search of protection
but it is precisely the legal security and the right of participation of refugees which must be considered
the european union calls throughout the world for freedom of movement for capital
every year many refugees die killed on the external borders of the eu
that concludes the vote
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
outcome of the european council in lisbon   march 
this objective also involves modernising the european social model investing in people and combating social exclusion
it also involves implementing sound macroeconomic policies encouraging economic growth and employment
strengthening the european council s coordinating and guiding role will be vital to developing the lisbon strategy
the european council will annually monitor the progress that has been made by holding a european council meeting each spring
this is an open method of coordination which we hope will produce optimal results
these guidelines will also be transposed into national policies and will be periodically monitored and assessed as part of a process of mutual learning between member states
the goals set at the lisbon european council are extremely ambitious and give specific mandates to the commission
just yesterday president prodi presented the commission s programme in this area to the council and also to the various council formations and it is therefore crucial that we bear in mind the diversity of platforms on which the strategy laid down in lisbon was developed with its implications for the fields of scientific research education the single market industry and so forth
the research council will assume responsibility for the eeurope action plan and for promoting the establishment of a european research area
it was certainly a turning point
even at this early stage the revised forecasts for both economic growth and employment are cause for optimism
our success in lisbon was largely due to the excellent preparatory work of the portuguese presidency
the lisbon debate generated substantial agreement on most issues
these issues are major but they are limited in number
this high level of consensus allowed the presidency to set an extremely ambitious agenda
i will not go into the conclusions in too great a detail but stick to the main points
in addition measures will be taken to accelerate the liberalisation of transport energy and postal services
research education and lifelong learning all received a boost
until recently such an agreement would have been unthinkable and this could be an extremely important development
the commission is therefore going to play a central role in the followup to this summit


the commission must act as the driving force in this process
tomorrow i am going to meet my fellow commissioners to ensure that work starts immediately and that the various different objectives set are achieved
i am determined to see that this commission makes good its promises
i would like to thank parliament before this house for its encouragement but also for the new ideas that it has given us during these debates
i repeat before this house that the need for this coordination is urgent spectacularly urgent
following my lead the heads of state and government agreed upon the need to clean up the danube
we have accumulated the necessary resources and i now expect appropriate measures to be taken
we also agreed to speed up the procedures for supplying aid to the balkans
i am counting on your full support and your cooperation to help us to achieve this
the eyes of the citizens of europe whom you represent are on us and they expect a great deal of the followup to lisbon
it is our duty not to let them down
i will borrow the words of the presidency
that will be dependent on the mobilisation of market forces available and action on the part of the member states themselves
the union will act as a catalyst in the process
in the decisions taken at the lisbon council those tools took the form of a social market economy which was a good thing
it will not be
greed will bring its own revenge in that the system will be made expensive and will be slow to establish itself
let me issue a second word of warning we are on the threshold of enlargement
the answer cannot be not to speed up developments in the direction of an eeurope
the ppede group and to the best of my knowledge the whole of parliament support the commission s work while voicing constructive criticism
madam president the lisbon summit will mark a milestone
the novelty of this summit is that it dealt with the entirety of economic and social policy
this is a quotation from belgium s liberal prime minister
some political forces within this parliament nonetheless appear to wish to turn the lisbon summit into some sort of socialist international happening 
how else is one to interpret the refusal of the ppe and eldr groups to negotiate a joint resolution common to the main political forces within parliament
some conservative and liberal ayatollahs seem not to want to hear anything about a macroeconomic and monetary policy of benefit to the european social model
the untrammelled free market seems to be their only god
yet the market economy must necessarily have a social dimension
here is a riddle in lisbon who was it that said that the citizens of europe are looking to the european council to give shape to a social europe
that the acrosstheboard return to economic growth means that we can do things today which were impossible yesterday 
these are the words of mrs nicole fontaine the president of this parliament
in short the group of the party of european socialists endorses the conclusions of our president whom we congratulate on her fair and courageous statements
we wish to combine economic efficiency quality of life and social protection
we want sustainable development in all these aspects
applause from the left
however we were very pleased about the farsighted messages which were to be found in the conclusions from the summit
finally i would offer an important and perhaps less complimentary remark
i hope that we are not to read too much into this apparent emphasis upon the intergovernmental character of eu cooperation
the conclusions of the portuguese presidency contain many positive commitments and objectives
the first point is the strategic goal
there is not one line on the reports which the commission nonetheless submitted at the european council in helsinki
not one line on the practical implementation of article  of the treaty on european union
the connection must be made between the dissemination of modern communication techniques and the implementation of sustainable development
the second point relates to employment
avoiding these questions is to invite serious social crises despite the spirit of optimism currently characterising the economy
the same applies to the matter of taxation which you mentioned
this is also true of the monti package
i cannot however be delighted by it
in my opinion this is indeed a huge challenge which must be accepted
an annual upturn in investment in people and adopting a proactive policy to promote full employment is something i am firmly in favour of
i could go on as there are countless conclusions completely identical to those in the  white paper
there is nevertheless one aspect that deserves a particular mention in the area of policies for full employment
in  the objective was to halve the number of unemployed in the european union from  million to  million
as one wellknown analyst said europe s leaders have decided on something that they cannot possibly achieve
this applies to both positive and negative aspects
the second problem is that the social problems entailed and which for better and particularly for worse are a very significant part of actual life in the european union have been ignored
the presidency s conclusions talk of the european social model 
i am not aware of any european social model i am familiar with a number of different models for social welfare tied to specific national traditions
in my own country there is a tradition which differs markedly from the dominant tradition in the european union
the real problem is being completely ignored
i must issue a strong warning against doing any such thing
there is to be a commitment to majority decisionmaking in this area
my own country s government opposes this and so do we who are sceptical about this selffulfilling development within the european union
the most significant legacy of the european council s summit in lisbon is all the unresolved problems
but lisbon is not the first summit to discuss the topic of employment 
since essen we have had numerous declarations of intent and wellmeant action programmes
paper is cheap
unfortunately there is a total lack of concrete results
we are all familiar with these requirements
everyone says yes that is quite right 
but implementation is where it falls down
as an austrian member i must also address the sanctions of the  in connection with lisbon
the ability to be democratic goes hand in hand with the ability to discuss
the efforts of the presidency to ban the subject of austria from the agenda gave me even more food for thought
it is in the interests of the union to clarify relations between austria and the eu
refusing all discussion was never a recipe for resolving a conflict
these symbolic gestures are the right way to open up old wounds between people
a democratically elected government cannot be separated from the people who elected it
judge the austrian government by its deeds
you will not find any violation of the spirit of the union
applause from the right
to call it the employment summit however would be to depart from its real purpose
it is like putting a fake label on a product which does not match the content
in this case it was done out of political expediency
the truth is that the objective of employment goes far beyond these issues
these strategies certainly have a harmful effect on economic growth on the distribution of wealth and consequently on employment
a farreaching debate on the problem of employment in the european union would inevitably therefore have to address these issues properly
madam president i wish to add my warm welcome and congratulations to the presidency on the successful achievement of the lisbon summit
i shall not dwell too much on the specifics of the lisbon summit
a lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions
i want to look at the challenges that are inherent in the lisbon process for parliament the commission and indeed all three institutions
in particular for parliament there is a huge challenge in realising the full legislative implications of completing a single market
there is a challenge in realising the full potential of the eeconomy
if we do not nobody will understand or forgive us for not realising our aim
we have to turn lisbon into something that means something to them something to the people in my home town of wolverhampton
to me lisbon is all about creating a europe of highlypaid highlyskilled highvalueadded jobs
that is our challenge
in conclusion i thank the portuguese presidency very much
i wish to discuss this problem which affects fundamental european policies
the council ought to think about this and work towards a real europe
this is the way we may finally achieve more balanced and more democratic european institutions
the lisbon conclusions mr president may however in other respects give rise to a number of reservations
since there is not much time let me cite just one the proactive goal of increasing the proportion of women in employment from  to  by 
this really is the type of authoritarian attitude which should be a thing of the past
it is not up to the authorities to say how many women must go out to work
this is a matter for the interested parties and civil society
the authorities must simply ensure that housewives receive fair treatment and that personal choices may be made freely
so the city of henry the navigator may become the city of netscape the navigator a new approach which i thoroughly welcome
the reality is that the european social model is now living in london and she is called laetitia casta
there is tension around europe but at the same time i detect a seachange
i rarely speak in debates after summits but this is an important one
i therefore look forward to some genuine action from the european commission
it is action not words that is needed
when i talk about words i am thinking about words like benchmarking and peer review 
do not worry it is meaningless
what actually matters is a light touch on the ecommerce directive a light touch on telecommunications
we do not need the heavy regulatory touch of the past
please mr prodi ignore your friends on the left and stick with the new world not the old world
it is a question of strategy really
so what is the strategy for making a success of this incredible economic transformation lisbon is promising us
it is a strategy which is radically innovative
the most basic example is employment
europe currently has  million unemployed whom it cannot absorb
some say these figures are set to reach  million next year
and even if we do fill these   jobs there will still be a further  million unemployed
we do not appear to have solved any problems whatsoever
this is the simple yet great idea of lisbon
we need to build information highways on which private enterprises can of course then create and run their own vehicles
however these highways can only be built by the member states by the public sector and by the european union
such cynicism borders on candour
as for the promise to create twenty million jobs in the years to come this is just as deceitful as it is ridiculous
lisbon aroused expectations as far as rectifying these shortcomings is concerned
mr president i welcome the lisbon conclusions
i stress the word potential because as others have said we now need to look at the followup
partly that followup is institutional
we wonder who will agree those structural indicators and just how strong the synthesis report to be produced by the commission will be
what will the role of the commission and this institution be
will it in fact be largely intergovernmental
if so i think we will be disappointed
but we are not just concerned about the institutional followup
we are also concerned about the substance
so we are concerned with the substantive followup as well
one point disappoints me  that is the stance of the epp in all this
it should be honest and say that like us it has always supported a social market economy
we welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets
but as always we want that to be balanced by solidarity and social inclusion
i hope the group has the political honesty to accept that it continues to support that point of view
i am talking about the request to the commission that it contemplate for  a coordinated strategy in the legislative field
clearly this will all have to be coordinated and we will even have to go further in laying down the new regulations or restructuring the existing legislation
improving quality must not only be directed at community legislation but also at the legislation of the member states
we must review the best business impact initiative
throughout the whole of this exercise we must take account of the interests of the consumers and the interests of the environment and these are complicated tasks
returning to simplification the slim initiative requires a complete revision
we need expiry clauses and we need to improve codification
codification is currently too cumbersome an instrument too ineffective and therefore we perhaps have to reform the treaty
we have to tackle that reform of the treaty
lastly we have to regulate more quickly and be more effective
therefore we need to make improvements in that respect as well
this is a domain of severe underachievement in the european union
we need deeper knowledge in science and technology
the sixth framework programme will be another tool
as well as deeper knowledge we need wider knowledge
we need to use the knowledge in better ways
we also need new sustainable technologies
the european socialists are fully behind the leap forward which is possible given the cogent analysis that took place at the lisbon summit
mr president many commentators have drawn adverse comparisons between the european union and the old soviet union
both have been profoundly antidemocratic both have seemed opposed to enterprise and wealth creation
at the lisbon summit it appeared that the eu had rediscovered a commitment to enterprise
although i have some reservations about references to the social market in the epp resolution i am happy to support it
let us hope that it is carried into effect and is more than mere soundbites and press releases
i have no doubt that she was prompted by the best humanitarian intentions
this goes beyond socialism this is pure marxism
it may have been appropriate for the kremlin in the s but it is totally out of place in st century europe
it is typical of this parliament that we call for an end to unemployment yet we promote actions that have the opposite effect
her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly
however mr gama all such conclusions have one drawback in common they cannot change the world overnight
we know how difficult the real world is and how difficult it is to get the european union to agree on a strategic objective
congratulations mr president
it appears that the socialist group only wants to hear onesided applause and praise about everything which took place in portugal
we too would like to congratulate you mr gama
there is a certain likeness between you and your distant predecessor vasco da gama at cape of good hope
the employment situation in europe seems to be slightly improving
as far as this is concerned congratulations are in order also for the fact that many fine promises have been made
it remains to be seen whether they will materialise or not
finally there is mr schroder who does nothing at all so we can be very brief about him
we are satisfied with what the portuguese presidency has said and brought about but we really need to wait and see whether action will follow
we have listed a few problems
it has taken socialists a very long time to get this far and we are pleased that they are nearly there
we also hope that they will implement it efficiently
unfortunately we have not yet seen any evidence of this
mr president ladies and gentlemen the report to the european parliament on the results of summits is always an experience
can the council really back out of its responsibility in the individual member states so easily
as the european parliament we should not accept this
even the desire to connect all schools to the internet is not a question which should be dealt with at european level
it needs to be done locally
lisbon missed its big chance to really improve things substantially for the citizens of europe
in the end people will take their leave of such a europe
we must not allow that to happen
mr president i believe in a common strategy which must be monitored from within europe
i think that the lisbon summit has given us a new impulse in this respect
this is important and these are aspects which one would expect from a summit
the ecommerce document springs to mind for example
this is an existing document
another example is the intention to draft a legislative frame for pension funds
this intention was formulated a long time ago
this is very serious
i would like to list three elements which are lacking in my opinion
firstly fiscal integration which has been talked about for so long
in order to take action in the economic field fiscal integration is required
secondly social security
there should be a convergence programme a kind of guideline for social security
finally i do not share the view of the british conservatives and i would like to make this quite clear
it is important to point out that within the group of the european people s party and european democrats there are also voices other than these
mr president few words are needed to conclude this debate for the debate itself has been extremely clear and detailed
to return to lisbon the debate was intense and passionate because it touched on tangible subjects of major concern
this is its strength
when the means of distributing the most basic simple wealth changes the entire economy changes as well
this is the boost we were waiting for we are now in a position to take the leap forwards thanks to the extensive coordination achieved in lisbon
this begs another comment on lisbon
i have observed some differences of opinion over the role of europe and the roles of the individual states
you must understand that this is a network
that is clear
this is the importance of these summits if we unite in our action we multiply its efficiency
this is the potential significance of lisbon
my final point is once again the development of human resources
this applies to both new and old economies as well
european investment in human resources is still low and this is a huge area in which we must make up lost ground
this is clear evidence of a development block which is due precisely to the failure to exploit our human potential
this gives me great pleasure for few people remember it
well for this to occur at european level is revolutionary although our task now is to set regulations in place to make teachers and researchers effectively mobile
in my opinion these are the genuinely important horizontal decisions adopted in lisbon
if we take into account the macroeconomic stabilisation referred to by president gama we have the genuine possibility of a sustained period of growth
in lisbon we laid the foundations for exploiting this period of growth now it is up to us to make sure we build upon them
thank you very much mr president of the commission
i have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to article  of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place on wednesday at  noon
the debate is closed
eu  africa summit cairo  and  april 
the next item is the council statement on the euafrica summit held in cairo on  and  april 

i would like to highlight some significant measures adopted by the summit
the commitment to reduce world poverty to half its present levels by  was reiterated
this report will then be studied at ministerial level under the summit s monitoring mechanism
concern was also expressed about the harmful effect on development of military expenditure which is constantly increasing
one fundamental area of dispute between europe and africa is returning stolen or illegally exported cultural goods
some progress was made on this issue too
the last part of the action plan concerns the monitoring mechanisms
mr president the holding of the summit was in itself a success achieved after considerable difficulties
these difficulties  mostly of a political character  remain and need to be tackled by africa and europe both separately and jointly
the summit was the first encounter at the highest political level between africa and the countries of the eu
we are spending development assistance money at the level of eur  bn per year
here the eu is still waiting for a number of g countries to play their part
we want to see the african countries as equal partners in the st century  the first century they are entering as independent states
the summit provided an opportunity for useful discussions on debt and other bilateral problems
other difficult questions such as the question of the return of cultural goods were also discussed
the declaration and plan of action adopted at the summit take account of the sensitivities on both sides
internationally recognised principles in particular human rights are respected and clearly reflected in the declaration
the text adopted in lisbon by the forum was widely distributed by the algerian and portuguese presidencies
our view is that the followup to the summit should wherever possible be pursued through existing mechanisms
the background is that we already have a credible working relationship
at the very least the two copresidents of the acpeu joint assembly could have made statements and this would have given an euafrican balance
the final cairo plan of action is an excellent document if we can now turn words and good intentions into concrete actions
for these ideas to come to fruition african countries themselves have to make the effort towards good governance
we have already seen some good election results
let us hope that we can see the same happening in zimbabwe ivory coast and togo in the forthcoming elections
the top priority of regional cooperation and integration should have strong political benefits as well as trade ones
the oau must be given international support to continue its work and the peace initiatives must come from the african countries themselves
ethnic cleansing has been the horror of the last  years and religious wars destroy the very fabric of a country
peace can bring prosperity
the main thrust of our aim therefore must be better education leading to better health care
through aids and malaria africa is losing the very generation it needs to build its future
mr president i appreciate that wideranging coverage of the issues by mr corrie
the cairo summit will be followed up by another forum in dakar on basic education
the need for basic education is the single most important cause of global poverty
therefore we need to ensure that girls in particular have equal access at least to educational advantage
we can see that education will deliver it will stimulate the economy it will offer opportunities to control population and increase health awareness
dakar is an opportunity to deliver on internationally agreed targets
the eu should put its political will behind universal primary education by the year 
clearly commitments made a decade ago have not materialised
in subsaharan africa more children are out of school now than a decade ago
 million african children today are not attending school
one third of the classrooms in africa do not even have a blackboard
they have no toilets
 of their schools do not have any clean water
some of you may be aware that julius nyrere spent his spare time translating shakespeare into swahili
but that man s wonderful dreams were lost
he lived to see one third of african men illiterate and two thirds of african women
i urge the commission and the council to make the link between poverty eradication and basic education
we have the blueprints and i urge all of those with the political will to take action to deliver for the children of africa
will anything come out of a meeting of this kind
well that probably depends upon how you look at it
that was not of course the purpose of the summit
whether or not concrete results will be achieved in this way will depend of course upon the political will we show in the future
on the contrary we affirm the political need to restore balance in the relations between african and the european union
this would enable us to pursue relations on a sounder basis
and the members of the european union must stop lying
need i remind you that some european union countries have less than  of women members in their national parliaments
we expect the african countries to observe ceasefires but we are fanning the flames of conflict with our arms exports to belligerents
but none of this is the key issue
once again as we have already said the european union and the member states must make their actions consistent with their statements
for while we are hesitating while we are shillyshallying while we are discussing africa is dying
mr president first of all i would like to emphasise that i consider the fact that this summit has been held to be extremely positive
but we also feel that the results of the summit fell considerably short of what was possible and indeed desirable
indeed the conclusions do not strike me as being adequate to address current needs and opportunities
this is occurring because the european union which has been consistently and mistakenly withdrawing its cooperation is being affected or guided in its cooperation with africa by two fundamental ideas
this is the route we must follow in the future
and why not
because no destination was established
where do you expect to get if you do not know where exactly you are heading
the next objective was socialism the fairhaired comrades
black africa was supposed to turn red
the result was famine in ethiopia algeria s agriculture destroyed not to mention guinea under sekou toure
the white man mitterand then offered africa parliamentary democracy parties instead of tribes
the result was a permanent situation of coup d etat even in the ivory coast
the present objective appears to be liberalism the market the imf the world trade organisation
they even set a figure  million africans were to be unloaded on europe by 
there is one word for this solution  protectionism and there is one instrument for this solution  customs barriers
this solution has been worked out in theoretical terms and called selfcentred development 
this is moreover what we have seen ladies and gentlemen with the privatisation of specific key sectors in africa
for the africans it was a negative outcome
in this respect the mediterranean could serve as a test bench for a euroafrican policy which respects identities
we have proposed an international organisation with an intergovernmental highsecretariat of the mediterranean
this would have its headquarters in cairo tangiers or tunis
an interparliamentary assembly like that of the acp
i feel that athens would be the ideal site or perhaps even a university in valencia montpellier nice or barcelona
and there perhaps the words of raymond loulle would hold sway
it could then be extended to relations between europe and subsaharan africa
this is a great project mr president on the scale of humanity as a whole and humanity needs both africans and europeans
all the more reason not to flood africa with the unregulated world economy and not to flood europe with an influx of people
i disagree with him on this
commissioner nielson also said something to that effect
i think that the atmosphere is important but as a basis for reaching sound agreements
if the agreements are not forthcoming then a good atmosphere is neither here nor there
nonetheless an euafrica summit is to be welcomed
i also feel positive about the portuguese presidency s initiative
mr president the european union has over the past  years invested a great deal of time and effort in development and cooperation
it is disappointing to have to state that this aid has not always had the required effect
excessive spending on defence or futile projects should be avoided
mr president the african countries have asked us to clear their debts
this is vital for the poorest countries especially if these enjoy good leadership and a balanced budget
but more than anything  as underlined by commissioner nielson we need to treat africa in an adult manner
we need to support what works but we also need to dare to speak up if certain things are unsuitable
mr president the recent euroafrican summit has given rise to concern even vexation but at the same time it has also given rise to satisfaction and hope
there was concern and vexation as a result of the way in which the european parliament remained in the margins of the summit process partly due to our indifference
this marginalisation and that of the african parliaments demonstrated a considerable incoherence on the part of the organisers
we must go much further much further than mere cooperation with development which by definition is an unfair form of cooperation
mr president taking this approach we will vote in favour of the good resolution with which this debate will conclude
mr president except for photographs and fine words the africa summit has yielded very little
so it is a pity that a number of things prevented that potential from being fully realised
firstly neither the european parliament nor the euacp joint assembly was invited to participate in the summit
secondly it is very sad that civil society was not able to have a greater input into the meeting
civil society has a key role to play in africa s development process
finally this meeting could have resulted in a farreaching action plan of concrete actions
finally  sadly  commodity prices were conspicuous by their absence from this agenda
a majority of african countries are overwhelmingly dependent on just one or two commodities for the bulk of their foreign exchange earnings
the continent of africa is ravaged by epidemics such as the aids epidemic and by wars that are conspicuous or sometimes forgotten
antipersonnel mines continue to kill innocent people arms of all kinds proliferate and fall into the hands of childsoldiers
the number of undernourished people in black africa rose from  million in  to  million in  the figures speak for themselves
illiteracy and unemployment affect the vast majority of young people on the african continent
the result is there is never enough fish and there are increasing numbers of people fighting over the leftovers
moreover the imf ordered ultraliberal policies supposedly for structural adjustment
these are policies that have never worked anywhere
quite the opposite
i do not know of a single example of a country which made any progress by applying their directives
we agree that we cannot carry on supporting dictators in the name of realpolitik
there is an imperative need for a new policy based on codevelopment conflict prevention and the rejection of the dictates of the financial markets
obviously this necessitates cancelling the  billion dollars of debt which is strangling any development in these states
finally mr president europe too made its wealth from colonialism and slavery
europe thus has a moral debt towards africa
part of our wealth came from the colonial plundering inflicted on africa
acknowledging that slavery was a crime against humanity would be an important gesture
there is no doubt that the many informal contacts which the summit created have been useful
the european council gave in to the demand of african dictators not to admit any parliaments to the summit
but how much more credible would words such as democracy and the interest of the people have been if those people had actually been represented
in that sense cairo was not a euroafrican summit but more like a summit of elites
it is evident that our political models cannot simply be transplanted
africa has to find meaning for the notion of democracy itself
the european union s reaction to violations of these principles is sometimes feeble and often divided
what other messages does the commission need in order to suspend development aid
the international community should not be tricked into feelings of guilt by the african leaders who do not carry any democratic legitimacy
it is high time that the european union told the african dictators where their responsibility lies
this event must not be used as an alibi it must mark the beginning of a real partnership
but who notices that here in europe
africa is the continent most seriously affected by the injustices of the international economic and financial system and the consequences of globalisation
governments which have not yet decided to join this move should copy those who have already done so
still less can there be any question of allowing financial aid and food aid from the european union to be misused in order to buy weapons
that is immoral and an important chance to make a move towards reconciliation may have been wasted
banning the ngo meeting from cairo was a most unpleasant side effect
mr president the cairo summit has been genuinely significant an historic milestone
it has been significant in terms of its meaning but also in terms of its lack of achievement
it is also significant insofar as its conclusions could not have been more feeble
obviously no one was particularly interested in apprising the african states of this fact
so it was certainly not a mobilisation summit as the press described it
then some and it is a great deal of the money would again be available to repay debts
it does not help matters if instead of attending working meetings one prefers to talk to gadaffi for  minutes
what the topic of conversation was one may only speculate
this seems to be the pattern for the summit in cairo too
some think it is a missed opportunity
they are extremely disappointed and can think of all sorts of reasons to support this view while others deem it a unique and historic event
this is as much our fault as it is africa s
i would like to praise the portuguese presidency because they could have quite easily opted out or it could have quite easily dragged on for a while longer but they took the bull by the horns
no i am certainly not expecting tangible huge successes but what matters is what happened at a deeper level
such a step is significant
you cannot develop the african people from within europe
the african people have their own plans and want to develop themselves but want help in order to achieve this
a new framework such as this really creates opportunities
within this framework room must be made for conflict prevention
ordinary regular contacts cannot work miracles
they will not bring about marvellous new results but they are necessary
they should become the norm
i would like to add one more point
apart from in this final note i made my contribution on behalf of the entire group of the party of european socialists
poverty therefore is a disease inflicted upon innocent populations by evil dictators greedy and corrupt politicians
natural disasters including climate change have aggravated the problem
they are poor insecure and exposed to the elements
they have no water sanitation energy medicine education or reliable shelter
they have no stake in their village regional or national economies
we here in this assembly offer these people open and free access to our eu markets
they cannot even market it in their own countries let alone sell it abroad
let us give them the technology transfer that makes sense before we say our markets are open to them
i would like to clarify a few points
firstly the question of linking parliamentary bodies such as the acpeu joint assembly and the european parliament as you will be aware this summit was negotiated with another party it was not imposed on them nor could it be
well let it be said that there were even problems in including references to the acp group in the final conclusions
why was this the case
secondly the acp group is not a purely african group it also covers the caribbean and asia
my only regret is that attendance is low but it is nevertheless of an extremely high calibre
and the oau for its part does not have a parliament
another important point is debt
we must not forget that there is a qualitative difference
this is unprecedented and has never been done by any other group of countries
it is extremely innovative and is greatly welcomed by these countries
the problem of reducing or cancelling debt could not be solved at the summit
the african countries considered this to be one of the most important milestones of this summit
it was time to put right this delay
it had never been done before
it was the first time
it was an excellent piece of work which furthermore was reflected and rightly so in the results of the summit
it was necessary to hold a summit with this scope on this scale and which would target these goals
we took that step
it is also essential for the european union to have an african agenda
we that is parliament the commission and the council are all working towards this
let me refer to some of the specific points made in the debate
mrs kinnock mentioned the forthcoming meeting in dakar on basic education
i have discussed aids in africa with president mugabe
i am not claiming to portray the whole situation in zimbabwe but this is an important point
in relative terms this is the case but we have been able to shield africa from direct reductions in the volume of what we are doing
i appreciate the support from parliament to that effect
mrs maijweggen mentioned that development aid has progressed over the years
i wish that were true
if we look at total official development assistance globally it has in fact decreased
we are now down to  and many governments should and could do more
in total numerical terms it is foreseeable that we will be increasing what we do in the coming years
this parliament our budget and our activities stand out as a sort of corrective measure to the global trend
we should be proud of that and we should make the most of it in political relations also
mr van den bos and others talked about debt relief and these problems certainly need a lot of attention
we welcome the cancellation of bilateral debt which is relatively easy to decide politically the difficult part is multilateral debt
this is something that should not be forgotten in the ongoing discussions
it may not be enough but it is certainly more than any other group of donors has done so far
mr zimmerling mentioned the problem of nigeria and getting money back
this should be part of international economic governance
money should not be able to disappear as has been the case
it was of real importance that the heads of state and governments spent two days together
they got along quite well
they certainly developed quite well in those two days
it was very successful and it has been a pleasure working with the presidency
that concludes the debate
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule   of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
external relations package
the next item is the commission communication on the external relations package
but i would like to focus on two issues touching on external relations and one of those issues in particular
we have spent eur  million on this important activity
as members of parliament will recognise the communication invites both parliament and the council to work with us on a more coordinated approach
it invites everyone to try to learn the lessons of the past
it is a very practical document
let me turn to a subject on which i would like to address the parliament at rather greater length
it is a subject which is very close to my own heart  imperfect a specimen though that may be
it is the rapid reaction facility which we have been discussing for some time and on which we have come to some conclusions
the people making those complaints were very often justified in doing so  not always  but very often
it is not a new problem as members of parliament will know  particularly members who have been on delegation visits to other countries
i have been frustrated at our slow and cumbersome procedures ever since i have arrived at the commission last autumn
the problems of slow decisionmaking and delivery are both structural and cultural
our procedures are old fashioned they are as i said cumbersome 
but the traditional legislative approach to community business is also sometime illsuited to the fast changing realities in external relations
this is particularly true for conflict prevention and it is particularly true for crisis management efforts
we have to do better and we can do better
we will present our proposals in the next few weeks
some things we can do relatively quickly others will take longer if for example complex legal changes are required
the rapid reaction facility is something that in our judgement we can do fairly quickly if we have the support of parliament and if we have the support of the council
i hope that support will be forthcoming because we have time to lose
inertia is only part of our problem today
the rapid reaction facility responds to these needs
i am suggesting a mechanism with the following broad characteristics
first there are the urgent timelimited operations in situations of crisis or emerging crisis
action should not normally last for more than nine months
third as with echo the procedures must be streamlined
i do not want to build up large structures where people create work while waiting for a crisis to happen
it builds on existing community instruments putting them to concerted use in a new framework
there is an inevitable indeed necessary area of overlap with existing instruments
i repeat the facility does not create a new instrument
the facility is a kind of quickstart package
it will allow us to react in time and if necessary to take the initiative in urgent circumstances
but rapid reaction facility action is not meant to last longer than absolutely necessary
similarly we do not want to create a large new bureaucracy which would hang around waiting for the next crisis to happen
i have dealt with that point earlier in my remarks
it is not an ideal solution
my own favourite economist and guru jane jacobs points out that everything is disappointing in practice
mr president i would first of all like to extend warm thanks to commissioner patten for his extensive clarification
i have a question pertaining to his first point
my question is will this be a structure similar to that employed in the united states
the european union which may be present on a massive scale is really lacking such an image
the honourable member has as ever made an extremely shrewd observation
there is an image problem it is one we address in the communication
image is important and we have addressed it in this document
i hope that if the honourable member thinks we have not done so adequately she will let us know
mr president commissioner i concur with mrs maijweggen s question
what sort of timetable should we be working towards
thirdly commissioner not all but many crises to which we must react can be prevented
firstly on visibility there is an early paragraph in this pretty lengthy communication which in my judgement sums up the problem rather well
the first is the lack of a clear eu policy and the necessary instruments to implement it
another factor is the participation of the european union under the umbrella of other international actors
that has often been a problem in the balkans and one with which the honourable member will be familiar
in other cases like palestine the lack of visibility was due to insufficient effort with the media
we have politicians who are actually still in the kitchen feeling the heat
at which point discretion is the better part of valour
secondly as far as the rapid reaction facility is concerned i want to see this up and running as quickly as possible
i have enough anecdotes to justify my impatience
i have no doubt at all that our energy for democracy programme which i mentioned in my remarks has been an extraordinary success
of course if you can act more rapidly you make a contribution to crisis prevention
it is one of the oldest saws in the book that it is incomparably more expensive to fight a war than to keep the peace
very often what is required to keep the peace or to prevent a crisis is not just doing things generously but doing them quickly and generously
there are a number of things we will be doing
i look forward to coming to parliament with some further ideas over the coming months
the idea is that the late payment directive could also be applied in these areas
that is an interesting and important point which i shall follow up
it is an extremely valuable contribution
i am also concerned about an even larger issue which is the amount of time between our commitments and our contracting
mr president i wish to congratulate the commissioner on the progress he has made on the rapid reaction unit
i should like to ask the commissioner a couple of questions
secondly concerning coordination what will the relationship be between this unit and the european union special envoys
what relationship will you be able to have with member states in order to ensure coordination of their independent activities
for a start it would be nice always to know what member states are doing
the high representative and his colleagues in the secretariat are bending their best efforts to try to achieve that at the moment
they are trying to explain for example to the united states the full scale of what europe is doing in the balkans
so we need to work more closely and in a more coordinated way
that is an issue which the high representative and i are attempting to take on more positively
we will keep in touch with them
i do not think that the sums of money that we are talking about are going to give us budgetary problems
we can manage eur  or  million
i should like to begin by thanking the commissioner for an excellent exposition of the rapid reaction facility
it is much needed
would he also consider whether he would extend the call for help  if the need arises  to beyond the european union countries
there are different sorts of crises and different sorts of disaster
the appalling floods in mozambique were a classic case for intervention by echo as a humanitarian intervention
it is very difficult to compartmentalise these crises
very often you need to use a number of instruments
what we have to ensure is that there are not any chinese walls between these various operations
there need to be chinese walls only in the budgetary sense
commissioner thank you very much for your statement
i strongly welcome this rapid reaction facility
it responds to longheld concerns which many of us have had
you are to be congratulated on the work that you have done
i should like to elaborate on the point which my colleague nirj deva mentioned
we are not just talking about urgency we are not just talking about effectiveness of action
the question of coherence is very important
you have the overall responsibility for external relations from the commission s point of view
i am thinking again of the role of echo
i recognise the case for coherence
it would be challenging politically to get up and make a speech in favour of incoherence
the honourable member is entirely right about that
but one has to bear in mind two important facts about echo
echo is justifiably jealous of its reputation for delivering humanitarian assistance without political strings being attached and without any political infusion
secondly it is very often the case that what marketing managers would call the deliverables are different
very often with echo one is talking about food medicine and blankets
with our rapid reaction facility one is very often talking about advisors mediators observers customs officials police officers and so on
there are differences
but i totally accept that there is a need for more cohesion
it is a considerable advantage that in this commission the external relations commissioners work together as a team
we are about to start sharing all the programming decisions together
it has not always been the case in the past
mr president i am sure the commissioner would agree that writing the report is the easy bit
the practical implementation is the difficult bit
there are situations such as that in the horn of africa which cover more than one state
the problems in the great lakes region cover a number of countries
it would be useful if you could link these problems on a regional basis and act from that point
would the commissioner agree with that
i agree with the honourable member on that point
i just wish to congratulate the commissioner on his replies
quite honestly echo needs more than a political infusion it needs somebody to see what is going on there
that is unacceptable
we have a situation in ethiopia where we knew for the past three years that there was a famine coming
the stores down there are empty
where was echo
absolutely nothing has been done
i shall be setting out the figures for our actual disbursements of food aid in ethiopia and eritrea
i just wish to add two points
firstly i do not share the honourable member s views on echo it does a very good job in difficult circumstances
we have managed to increase our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance
what we have not done is to increase our ability to make that humanitarian assistance unnecessary in the first place
there is a food crisis in the horn of africa
so i hope i catch your eye tomorrow in the debate and make some of these points
i have great sympathy for the problems being faced by ethiopia and eritrea
mr president on a point of order
could you let us know exactly how question time is going to be organised now
will questions to the commission  ostensibly due between  pm and  pm be taken
i can inform you that question time will last an hour
therefore we will be working from seven until eight
the first part questions to the commission will last  minutes
we will dedicate  minutes to each commissioner instead of the usual  minutes
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
at the request of the commission we will begin with the third question so that mr patten can answer it
first part
question no  by h
can the commission comment on rumours to the effect that it is not participating in the work of the new military committee
can the commission explain the reasons for this nonparticipation
will the commission insist on its right to participate
only in exceptional circumstances and on a casebycase basis can the commission be excluded from these meetings
in helsinki it was confirmed that the development of esdp should take place within the existing institutional framework
we are still discussing arrangements for the interim military body
mr president may i thank the commissioner for that excellent and comprehensive answer which goes a long way to reassuring me
i realise that the honourable member is a greater expert on these institutional issues than i am
it is not therefore surprising that he is holed in one
i very much hope that it can be resolved satisfactorily over the coming weeks
secondly has the commission drawn any conclusions as to the security implications of its participation in the military committee
i certainly do not think that is an issue
there is a general issue about security which i know the high representative is addressing and rightly so
i hope that we do not have to resort to the sort of measures suggested by the honourable gentleman
i hope that we can solve this in a civilised and sensible way
i repeat we do not have  to borrow a phrase  ideas above our station
thank you very much mr patten
i believe we have asked you all the questions we were going to ask you today
we therefore wish you a good afternoon
question no  by h
one group of people that cannot make use of that right are those who require regular haemodialysis because of malfunctioning kidneys
this severely restricts the ability of families with dialysisdependent members to travel
according to these rules dialysis qualifies as emergency treatment provided that the purpose of the visit is nonmedical
children parents or young people in families where someone is dialysisdependent are often very keen to travel
they work and are given holidaytime but they are unable to go on ordinary tours
it has nothing to do with whether someone is chronically ill or an acute case
the decisive question is whether or not this is emergency treatment and the answer to this question is yes
the commission departments have made such information available
question no  by h

if i am not mistaken the commission is not considering this option
no applications have been filed
that is the drawback with this variation
it would only be possible to register the name chocolate and issue a certificate of special character under the first procedure referred to
the commissioner actually answered my question in the second part of his answer
i am very glad that we finally put this directive to bed in the last session
we take note of your statement in favour of good chocolate mrs banotti
question no  by h
mr president i should like to start by saying that i share the concern behind the honourable member s question
this is not a problem specific to the candidate countries of the european union
unfortunately as you well know i am sure the problem encompasses many perhaps even the majority of countries in the world
allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations
that includes the legally binding regulations for the protection of children
the most important of these is the joint action to fight the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children on which a decision was reached on  february 
if this proposal is accepted it will become part of the community acquis which applies in candidate countries
the following programmes are relevant to child protection first the daphne programme approved on  january 
the countries seeking to join the union can also join this programme
then there is the stop programme for the period from  to 
this programme helps to develop coordinated initiatives to fight the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children
the commissioner showed us where his heart was in the opening remarks
it was a totally horrendous programme although i agree social exclusion is a major factor in these dreadful occurrences
there is also the question of internet pornography
poland is one of the significant countries from which much of this is being broadcast
it is not enough that we have these small underfunded programmes
i should like to explain to the honourable member what my feelings are in this matter not just the legal aspects
the entire problem has only arisen because there are people in our societies who will pay money for it
in romania there are no people paying for it
now let me come to romania
i cannot confirm the accuracy of the bbc television report
the fact that something has been broadcast on the bbc does not automatically mean that it is true
not that i am saying that it is untrue
simply that we cannot confirm it
it is a problem that should be a cause for concern to everyone in europe
the commission intends in the course of  to present the european parliament with a new legal basis for the stop programme for the period 
however commissioner we must also admit that the intervention of the eu s institutions has been both inadequate and ineffective
are you aware commissioner that concentration camps still exist where women are raped before being forced into prostitution
i am going to ask you to be brief and i am going to be brief
this is the rule in this house
question no  by h
are eur m to be deducted from the items earmarked for agriculture funding to cover the costs of kosovo
the funds required for this task need to be anchored in the budget accordingly
the resolution on agenda  was taken i would remind you on the same day that the war in kosovo broke out
it is precisely this call that the commission is addressing
i hope that when faced with these realities parliament will support the commission proposal
the commissioner confirms our suspicions that commissioner fischler is hiding things from us and hiding himself as well i am not surprised that he left the chamber hardly ten minutes ago because this proposal is shameful
all of this demonstrates that agenda  has been nothing but a great firework display
this is a disgrace for european agriculture
it does not surprise me that given this outrage the commissioner responsible
this is a disgrace
a disgrace
it would be unacceptable to find money for kosovo  which i support  at the expense of the very poor in the world
does the commissioner agree with that
i should like to thank the honourable member for his remarks
i should also like to clarify that it is really not in the nature of my colleague mr fischler to run off and hide
we have examined this carefully
i should like to state clearly at this point that this redeployment will not of course have any effect on income support for farmers
question no  by h
payments as a proportion of total commitments have fallen over many years and barely  per cent of commitments reportedly are paid out
one of the reasons for this situation is the delays in implementing the union s projects
the absurdity of this system is becoming increasingly apparent
in the commission s view what structural measures are required to overcome the delays in payments
questions to mr kinnock
mr president the commission is doing its utmost to settle proper payment applications within  days
the large majority of invoices can be paid within this period and the number of overdue payments is falling satisfactorily
the commission is currently updating this analysis
the second factor relates to the takeup of these budgetary funds ie both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations
this applied to a sum of around eur  billion in 
i hope that we can count on your support
thank you for your answer
perhaps both these matters are problems which the commission ought in that case to do something about
i should like to offer my warmest thanks for your suggestion
do you intend to use benchmarking or best practice methods
of course the aim is to have few if any exceptions
thank you very much mrs schreyer
since the time allotted to mrs schreyer has elapsed question no  will be replied to in writing
question no  by h
what is the excact definition of this external legal expert  and what legal expertise will this person be required to have
the action plan does not however specify that an external legal expert should sit on the board
the document will include recommendations for improving administrative procedures and for making relevant amendments to the staff regulations
i thank the commissioner for his reply
 i am grateful to the honourable member for his question
question no  by h
point  of your action plan makes reference to this situation but offers no remedy for it
how do you plan to address this
questions to mr byrne
in neither case would disciplinary action result from making such reports
the commission will present detailed proposals in a document scheduled for october of this year
as the law requires consultations on those proposals will be undertaken with staff and with the other european union institutions
preparatory work on the proposals is progressing under the directorgeneral for administration
will this be framed for example along the lines of the swedish government s or the british government s rules on whistleblowing
could the commissioner inform parliament as to the exact circumstances in which paul van buitenen now finds himself
i am grateful to the honourable member for his question
firstly the development of the proposals relating to whistleblowing will take full account of best practice in several of the member states
he made a couple of applications one of which was for a job in the commission
he was successful in that application and i am pleased to say that he was duly appointed
we thank vicepresident kinnock for his replies
since the time allotted to mr kinnock has elapsed questions nos  and  will be replied to in writing
question no  by h
however the commission has not yet established whether the swedish authorities are now complying with current eu rules
is the commission of the opinion that the swedish authorities are complying with common rules
if not how will the commission ensure that the swedish authorities comply with eu legislation in this respect
the commission following its inquiries was officially assured that the swedish stud book rules had been aligned with ec legislation
i should like to thank you for your answer
i should like to point out that what we are concerned with here is an individual citizen whose livelihood has been affected
it is a matter costing an incredible amount of money
it has cost an ordinary citizen who has made a business out of horses an incredible amount of money because swedish associations have not been willing to approve his stallion
i thank the member for her supplementary question
as i indicated earlier this is essentially a matter between two member states
the danish breeding association in my opinion should have taken up this issue with the swedish association
the way question time is run is not acceptable
firstly it does not start on time
we had group meetings i was watching the screen and you jumped from question  to 
that makes it impossible for members to be here
in addition question time did not start at the time stated on the agenda
how are we meant to function in this way
it makes it virtually impossible for us and is not a fair procedure
mrs mckenna today s question time has been ratified by the plenary in this house
it was explained this morning at the beginning of the sitting we have accepted certain rules and we have skipped questions when the authors have not been present
i am therefore very sorry that we now have to conclude question time
we especially thank mr byrne who has been here all afternoon so that he could answer questions
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the commission
the siting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
situation in turkey
the next item is the council and commission statements on turkey

today s meeting will be followed up at the forthcoming meeting of an association committee which will study these issues in greater detail
the helsinki resolution brought about a net and lasting improvement in relations between the eu and turkey
at last it is again possible to discuss all issues openly and critically
stronger political dialogue is again taking place at all levels
above all helsinki confirmed that compliance with the political accession criteria was the sine qua non to starting negotiations
the copenhagen political criteria concern democracy the rule of law human rights and the protection of minorities
turkey does not yet meet these criteria which is why negotiations will not start until they do
in the meantime however turkey and the other candidate countries will start to benefit from a strategy of rapprochement and stronger political dialogue
we plan to submit the first accession partnership in the autumn of this year
the presidentinoffice has already spoken about screening and i need say no more on that subject
i should however like to say a few more words about the political situation in turkey
i am sorry that the opportunity was not taken to suspend imprisonment on humanitarian grounds
from an economic point of view turkey is in a position to make rapid progress
of course i shall continue to keep you informed of all aspects of these new endeavours
the public and private sector spokesmen we recently met in turkey all readily agreed on this
the ball is in turkey s court
it is up to turkey to decide whether the first obstacles encountered on this new road are to prove insurmountable or not
commissioner verheugen has just recapitulated these expectations
it is difficult to discern any further democratic developments during these first four months
even progress with the protection of minorities leaves much to be desired and we are somewhat sceptical about the question of the rule of law
mr birdal advocates peace mr birdal advocates solving the problem of minorities without violence
mr birdal s reputation as a human rights activist extends well beyond the borders of turkey
mr president when turkey joins the european union the impact and the benefits will be considerable
the eu will then have to adjust and in a welcoming way
i am glad the commissioner stressed these
to say this is not to be antiturkish
will not other turkish citizens benefit also
however we were then forced to acknowledge a number of incidents which we were and are unable to accept
the mayors belonging to hadep were arrested and we rightly criticised this move
unfortunately he must serve another six months of a oneyear sentence
turkey must at last abolish the death penalty the only country in europe yet to do so
and we should not have to wait for a reform policy on the kurdish question
we are prepared to be patient as far as the speed of democratisation is concerned
but we will not accept a standstill on this issue
in this sense we shall continue to support the helsinki process
mr president ladies and gentlemen whoever wants to join the eu must meet the copenhagen criteria and abolish the death penalty
including turkey
despite frequent promises by the turkish government human rights violations continue there
i should like to list a few examples the kurdistan democratic party has been exposed to attack since  february
akin birdal has started serving the rest of his sentence
thousands of turkish troops marched into northern iraq at the beginning of april
more than   soldiers are stationed on the border in order to fight the pkk despite its call for peace
why are arms being delivered to turkey
more than   people gathered for the navruz festival in diyarbakir under the banner peace brotherliness and democracy 
having been there my personal impression is that the people are longing for peace and democracy
it will be the task of the european commission and the council to strengthen their commitment here
mr president all of us who have visited turkey recently realise that the picture is very complex
the first impression is that there is a sort of eu euphoria in turkey when it comes to the media
there is a very lively debate in the country
that is very important
secondly the trade unions popular movements etc all say the same thing
they think it is positive that turkey is a candidate country
we even heard akin birdal on the eve of his imprisonment say that a new turkey has been emerging in the last five months
we must realise that we will have a lot of ups and downs in our relationship and that we will have both progress and setbacks
perhaps we are seeing something new being born
but the old legal system is still there
that is what is working against democratic fighters such as akin birdal
but we also see the reformists who know very well what has to be done according to the copenhagen criteria
one party leader said to us that at least  articles of the constitution and penal code had to be changed
first you have the antireformists the fundamentalists and so on who do not want membership
then you have a third group who say that they want turkey to become a member but on turkish terms
almost automatically they will have to deliver if turkey is to become a member one day
the first was that nothing will prevail without a strong civil society in turkey
we know that and we would like the commission to look into that
the other and last message is that yes we have the roadmap but we need more precision from the roadmap
help us to be more precise with the roadmap because we want to follow it
mr president the question of whether or not turkey belongs to europe is not primarily a geographical issue nor is it primarily an economic one
this will not require any sacrifices probably unlike turkey s other issues but it will be for the good of all inhabitants of turkey itself
as a matter of fact i am of the opinion that we should not aggravate the situation by supplying arms
this is why we want to give turkey the benefit of the doubt
i should like to point out that in helsinki greece withdrew its reservations and turkey became a candidate country
greece has made a great many gestures of good will and good neighbourliness a great many
turkey has made none
i just wonder who have they been trying to liberate for the last  years and from whom
have they still not managed to do so
i would point out that when we visited turkey as parliament s representatives we asked to see leyla zana
we were not allowed to see her because she was in prison
akin birdal who held talks with mr baron crespo was taken into prison while he was standing outside
i just wonder if the commission s regrets will help to get akin birdal out of prison tomorrow
is that such a drastic step
commissioner you mentioned the interministerial committee
it is true that numerous structures are being set up
i have been aware of this in turkey since 
if they are obliged to comply with something they start by setting up committees and commissions interministerial extraministerial every sort of committee under the sun
the structures are superb we can all agree on that
except that they do nothing
that is how easy it is to take the first steps
i warned you about that
a number of factors which have been listed here several times already make this sort of prognosis appear premature
the fact that all this has been accompanied by a recent offensive against the pkk in northern iraq only adds to this impression
i experienced surprise after surprise and also disappointment after disappointment
the situation is in fact as a number of fellow members have described it
and it must take it because paper alone is cheap
changes need to be made here
i would like to add two or three minor points
turkey has its internal problems but it has its external problems too
but no this is not the case
in this sense if we try to paint a skewed picture of reality then of course it will be a false one
and in politics false realities produce false results
as you know historically such a thing is just not possible

no
nobody said that
and this is something upon which we agree
i considered the speeches to be demanding ones calling for the whole process to be scrutinised thoroughly
the european parliament obviously has an important role to play in this
turkey will not be admitted to the european union without the european parliament s approval
turkey has merely been recognised as a candidate
the copenhagen criteria are clear and turkey must not be discriminated against either positively or negatively
i can tell you that the commission is not carrying out an assessment even now
this has not yet started but the commission has been instructed to prepare it
the commission is involved in bilateral discussions with turkey in order to provide it with information on the acquis communautaire
we are therefore at an exploratory stage
it is obvious that the turkish political process is a complex one
i should like to expressly stress here that there can be no discounts for anyone including turkey when it comes to accession conditions
i do not know what is easy and what is difficult to do in turkey
it is in our interests that the reformorientated democratic proeurope forces carry the motion in this debate
i should like to close by saying that we are still just right at the beginning
we are in fact at the beginning of the beginning
we are only just preparing the preaccession strategy
by definition strategies only deserve to be called such when they can go the whole course
i therefore advise on a little patience here
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at the next voting session
deliberate release into the environment of gmos
it seems to me that this vote could be a watershed
there are a number of critical issues which need to be addressed
the first and the most important is the issue of producer liability
i feel that the compromise we have found with the christian democrats is one that is viable and workable and i hope it will find support here
i want to see that european commission proposals have real teeth when it comes to this parliament in the not too distant future
in addition to that critical issue there are also a number of other important questions
tomorrow we may take a softer line but nevertheless we want to see action in this area
we want to ensure that serious consideration is given to the dangers of using these crops
here we need to go to at least as far and perhaps beyond the measures agreed in the biosafety protocol in montreal in january
many people fear the possible consequences of genetic pollution and it is our job to respond to those fears
we have been lobbied by very many groups during the process of developing this legislation
not just the industry but also friends of the earth and greenpeace have given their backing to various aspects of parliament s report
the lobbying has become quite intense in the last few weeks
the outcome of the vote in parliament tomorrow is likely to bring a few shocks and surprises
that can be only good for the future development of this new technology within the european union
for the biotechnology industry that can only be to the good
those who know me know that i am not a blind advocate of genetic engineering
many aspects worry me
however today we are debating the release of genetically modified organisms especially plants
and in my view and in the view of the ppe this is a different kettle of fish
it makes provision for a great many rules to govern monitoring labelling and informing the public
take the example of genetic transfer
all we hear about are frankenstein plants and superweeds
i have a key witness here
we are also opposed to discrimination against biotechnology when it comes to liability
we do not want specific genetic engineering liability we want general environmental liability
it has frequently been said that the commission must be forced to do something at long last
the common position is not too weak in our view it is too strong on certain points
i think that the common position gives us good control of the risks
i think it is a very competent piece of work and i think some important improvements have been made to the common position
i shall single out the points i think are most important
i think it is important for health reasons
i think that is a major flaw in current practice in this area
in that way we can be properly sure that the necessary monitoring is carried out
finally i would call attention to the question of objective liability
if insurance cannot be taken out to cover such circumstances then the risk in granting a licence is too great
i hope we shall see the adoption of these amendments designed to tighten up on the common position
in my opinion the present legal basis is far too weak
the following points are key issues for the liberal group and these will also influence our voting behaviour
first and foremost there is the issue of the freedom of choice for consumers
secondly we would like to see the public have plenty of opportunity to have its say during the approval procedure of gmos
one controversial issue is producer liability
we are in favour of the selfregulating effect this has
ideally we would like to see this liability included in the longawaited horizontal regulation of environmental liability
the present proposal is important to both producers and consumers and is welcomed by the liberal group
we too would like to congratulate the diligent rapporteur on this report
mr president where the release of genetically modified crops into the environment is concerned the precautionary principle must be the decisive factor
at present it ought to entail a moratorium on the release of new genetically modified crops into the environment
the proposals to be adopted tomorrow will not go anything like so far as we would have wished
we shall therefore vote in favour of as satisfactory a solution as possible to the issue as a whole
this means that we shall be voting in favour of most but not all of the proposals in the bowe report
we shall be voting in favour of a situation in which those who release genetically modified crops into the environment are held fully liable under civil law
furthermore we were critical of the authorisation procedures stipulated in the proposal which seemed to us too lenient and inordinately centralised
a year on studies have been conducted that even more clearly highlight the dangers of releasing gmos
in these circumstances we find the text which has been presented to the house for second reading increasingly outmoded
how is it possible in this day and age that we have to demand a right as selfevident as this
mr president in february  we discussed the revision of directive  at first reading
i would remind you that in his contribution mr blokland talked about the importance of the precautionary principle
we are thus delighted that the council has underlined this principle in the common position
i mainly have the restriction of the simplified procedure and the attention to gmo traceability in mind
on the whole we should therefore be satisfied with the present proposals
we are particularly delighted with the stricter wording related to reducing the risks for consumers
compared to amendment no  the original amendment to article   was more forceful in our opinion
it very explicitly spelled out the possibility of consulting ethical committees in the case of ethical issues
the present amendment no  on the other hand only underlines the importance of being open with the public
we regret this toning down
plants and animals are not production factors which can simply be manipulated
the biotechnology debate requires an integral ethical approach
we believe that god created the world
based on this awareness we need to treat the natural world around us responsibly
mr president this is a debate about plant research and plant protection from research
it is a debate about the potential of gmos for good and their potential for risk and how you manage that risk
you cannot abolish risk because it is part of our natural environment
we cannot prevent all manmade risk because that would end scientific progress
i believe there are four areas where we must act to reassure the public
i believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology
firstly antibioticresistant genes must be phased out
the amendment sets a realistic but urgent date of  for that
secondly we must be open with the public about where experimental crops are being grown
that is only right
it is fair
in return we must ask environmental action groups to show restraint and responsibility with regard to that knowledge
i suspect we do not so long as we already have criminal civil product and environmental liability in law
we can gain real benefits from gmos if we get it right
fewer crop sprays for example would benefit the environment if we grew gmo crops that did not need so many crop sprays
but we have to take the public with us with the science
i believe these measures will help to do just that
that is why i cannot understand why the industry and the lobbyists are so concerned about the issue of liability
if they are so sure that their products are safe then why are they afraid to take responsibility both as regards liability and compensation
the other issue i should like to address is the contamination of gene transfer
we have a situation where for example conventional farms can be contaminated with gmos
if you have contamination of conventional farms or organic farms there is basically no free option for the consumer
this is not acceptable
firstly the protection of public health
it seems to us that we should strictly forbid the use of antibioticresistant genes
secondly the commitment to international agreements
finally mr president the prevention of genetic contamination
mr president i should like to start by complimenting mr bowe on his objective and balanced presentation
in previous debates in parliament i have put on record my own views in relation to biotechnology
of course there are concerns on the part of consumers
they are entitled to an indepth and independent evaluation of what is a rapidly changing technology
the longer we allow the confusion to exist the greater the delay in enabling society to benefit from its full potential
but there are now welcome indications that the industry has taken on board parliament s concern in this regard
in short the consumer must at all times be given a choice
mr president ladies and gentlemen european consumers are justifiably concerned about genetically modified organisms and their release
it is europe s duty to pass stringent legislation that will make these alchemists accountable and to guarantee product quality whilst also providing citizens with clear information
we totally agree with the line of thinking adopted in this report
we must also require the prior approval of the recipient country before any trade can take place
europe must not be left behind the usa and japan
we should therefore win consumer confidence and the way to do so is by improving safety standards
we are awaiting a more general proposal from the commission on product liability and safety
we must not overreact if we want this directive to promote and support such a promising sector
according to the gene tech industry the risks of such unwanted contamination are low
if these risks are so low why is it then that the gene tech industry refuses to accept any legal liability
the christian democratic position will rebound perfectly off the gene industry
mr president genetic engineering and biotechnology are the key technologies of the future
we are already lagging far behind other countries
but it is precisely these obstruction tactics which several groups within the european union are applying
they of course appear to be rather ideological in nature because generally there are no material grounds for them
this attempt at obstruction can be found in a series of proposed amendments in the bowe report
the call for special liability means that farmers dare not use gmos
no one wants to play down genetic engineering including me
but nor can we demonise it
farmers have always endeavoured to use targeted breeding and cultivation techniques in order to develop efficient plant and animal material
it is our task to ensure that this technology is used responsibly not to prevent it
mr president i would urge colleagues to strengthen this report by insisting on environmental liability
the commission promised the introduction of horizontal legislation over ten years ago
but even though we now have a white paper the actual legislation is some years away
we must address those very real issues
consumers are demanding the strictest controls and will be satisfied by nothing less
it is vital that all the necessary safeguards are now included in this directive
we must be careful however that we do not now just sit back in the belief that we have finished our work
the time limits we adopt for processing applications should not therefore be applied as the rule but instead constitute an absolute maximum
we must reject the proposal that the entire liability for any damage should be shifted onto whoever has released the gmos into the environment
genetically modified products and biotechnology give rise to a number of questions and concerns
the most important are perhaps what are the benefits
what are the risks
how do we best avoid possible negative effects
how do we ensure that we have access to all the relevant information
here the european institutions the member states industry and science all have to take their responsibilities
the basis for meeting these new challenges has to be an efficient and transparent legislative framework
our role as european policymakers should be to provide for a balanced response to these new challenges
at the same time it has to allow society to benefit from the development of modern biotechnology
we are here today to strengthen and improve the existing framework
the sensitivity and complexity of the matter might explain why we are confronted with a total number of  amendments at second reading
the commission can accept in their entirety amendments nos     and  which improve the quality and the clarity of the texts
the commission can also accept in principle amendments nos  to      to     and 
they further strengthen the intention of the commission to establish an efficient transparent and balanced regulatory framework for gmos
the european community was one of the driving forces in the successful adoption of the cartagena protocol on biosafety in january
the commission therefore welcomes the spirit of amendment no 
however the commission cannot accept the inclusion of provisions on import and export obligations in the text of the directive
we believe that the implications of the protocol on the overall european union legislative framework have yet to be fully assessed
amendments nos   and  are therefore not acceptable in the present revision
let me now turn to the issue of liability and i know that this is an important political subject for all of you
the commission did exactly that when adopting the white paper this year
this will provide clarity for complainants and prevent loopholes
this is also the best way to complement the existing horizontal system for product liability already covering gmos
i can assure you that i will do my utmost to be able to present a proposal for legislation on liability before the end of 
i can therefore accept amendments nos   and  in principle as far as they refer to the commission white paper
let us be clear if this is put in this directive rules will have to be made to ensure legal clarity and how long will that take
it must be seen in that context
however i cannot accept amendments nos   and 
i am also fully aware of the political importance of certain other aspects raised by the proposed amendments
it is clear that antibiotic resistance marker genes need to be phased out and be replaced with alternatives as soon as practically possible
a phaseout is already foreseen in the common position
the commission agrees to strengthen this political message
the commission cannot agree to a general ban of gmos containing antibiotic resistance marker genes
instead we should continue to carry out a comprehensive casebycase risk analysis
within these limits amendments nos    and  are therefore acceptable in principle
the commission can therefore agree to a recital concerning socioeconomic aspects which refers to the reporting obligation of the commission
this will be done every three years under article 
the commission welcomes amendments nos  and  concerning gene transfer
they constitute a balanced approach between a total prevention and a permissive approach
however the wording should be aligned with the text of the directive
however the commission cannot accept amendment no  concerning the prevention of gene transfer
gene transfer between organisms is as we know a common phenomenon in nature
this is both for administrative and legal reasons
this concerns in particular the plant breeding industry
the commission will therefore consider how due account can be taken of these concerns while ensuring political legal and administrative consistency
in this context amendment no  is also not acceptable since this would limit the flexibility of the optional time limitation of consent for the renewal
amendment no  seeks to introduce a provision which allows for the introduction of differentiated procedures under part c of the directive
this builds on the original proposal as presented at first reading in parliament
however this amendment goes beyond the commission proposal and is therefore not acceptable to the commission as it stands
the commission is however willing to reconsider this amendment in the light of its original proposal and within the framework of an overall compromise
finally i should like to deal as a package with the amendments i have not yet addressed
amendment no  concerning a centralised community procedure is not acceptable
access to the work of the european group on ethics and their opinions is an important of the general evaluation
the commission is however of the opinion that this is already appropriately covered in the rules of procedure of the committee
amendment no  is therefore not acceptable
to conclude we urgently need a revised directive 
we all have to take our responsibilities in achieving this and this is the only way in which we will win the trust and confidence of our citizens
i just want a yes or no
can you give parliament a guarantee  and i should like a yes or no  that compulsory insurance is contained in a horizontal directive
my second point is this unfortunately you did not go into proposed amendment no 
can you confirm that there is no eu legislation for gmos in contained use
there is a gap in the legislation here and i think that this is very important for tomorrow vote
i should like a clear answer on this
i am not reopening the debate
commissioner do you wish to reply
 mr president i shall start with the second part of mrs breyer s question
it is true that there is no specific community legislation for the contained use of genetically modified plants and animals
that is why we cannot accept amendment no 
as you know we have now issued a white paper on environmental liability
your views are also welcome
i intend to ensure that this paper covers gmos
it already covers product liability
the white paper is a first step as you know
that has to be discussed in depth and i will come back with a proposal
i believe it will be possible to put an insurance system in place
the debate is closed
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  am
identification registration and labelling of beef
we also fought a battle to push through the implementation of the measures laid down in this regulation as swiftly as possible
in short we all know what we are talking about
meat from bovine animals will carry a label indicating the origin and history of the animals from which the meat is derived
so we are talking about an extremely complex operation
i believe that we have managed to achieve this
i would just like to look at two amendments two categories of amendments
the provisions recommended by the commission are to my mind extremely minimal
the interested party submits an application and after a period of time the system which he wishes to apply is applied
i propose that we change this system
anyone labelling meat must have explicit approval from the competent public authorities
we want labels which are practicable simple safe cheap and easy to control
labels must be easy for consumers to understand which is why the information needs to be kept to a minimum
consumers want information not a novel
this applies in particular to information on the region of origin of the meat
we shall have problems explaining this to consumers
now the committee on the environment has opted for  september  and i think that we can agree to this date
it is only a matter of four months
mr president beef labelling has two distinct functions
the two should not be confused
the need for information sprang from the bse crisis
although the united kingdom has the highest incidence of bse it also has the most comprehensive control measures
therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from
reference to regions should not be an alternative to country of origin but a voluntary addition
the well established description of scotch beef should continue to be used
many consumers would be confused if given information about hanging or maturation which could be mixed up with sellby dates in their minds
we should not go down this road
animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically
similarly reference to fattening methods should not be introduced
mr president my group welcomed the report by mr papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence
he has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the council
however we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead
this is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay
we do that on the basis that the key proposal plainly has to be the issue of timing
some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave
we are now talking about implementation of the first stage in september  and the second stage in september 
we believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole european union on the move
that is why we want the second stage as set out in article  to be distinct and a commensurate advance
why do we want that
they would be able to say to others look  you cannot do it you are at fault
we say to those who are resistant to this please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board
one day eu origin may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment
we need to know from which state a product has arrived
i know that there are people in the netherlands who disagree with that and i would be interested to know why
minced beef is as much if not more at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources
we need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else
we agree with the rapporteur s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in amendments nos  and 
my last point is to end where i began
we know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it
it was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result
mr president rapporteur ladies and gentlemen it is important to reinstate market confidence
the crucial factor is that it should be possible to trace with certainty the origins of what we eat
this amendment would entitle producers to provide information on the label in addition to the name of the nation where the goods concerned originate
i am very pleased about mr whitehead s remark about minced meat
i fully and wholeheartedly support amendment no  from the rapporteur
they have approached the issue with the same consistency demonstrated by the european parliament
the postponement adopted is not lawful
the european parliament has filed charges against the council because the postponement was not within the council s discretion
nor did the commission come up smelling of roses here
it was the commission which proposed this seemingly elegant but legally dubious procedure
if nothing is done compulsory labelling will enter into force on  september 
the basis for this was and still is the passport for each individual animal which provides information on place origin and birth
mr president the people who will be most shocked to learn of this evening s debate must surely be european consumers
fortunately the appropriate initiatives by the most enterprising member states have compensated for the extraordinarily slow reactions of the community apparatus
it is therefore all the more deplorable that they should have been deprived of this possibility by the treaty of amsterdam
i am thinking in particular of the compulsory labelling system which was drawn up in france together with livestock farmers and distributors which has been in force since 
this system has proved very effective
it has made it possible to restore consumer confidence
france had simply forgotten that it no longer had the right to do this
consumers want to be certain of the operators ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately
the member state of origin must therefore be indicated
this protection is undoubtedly belated in principle but above all illusory in practice
firstly in the draft regulation  of european meat is effectively exempt from compulsory labelling if it is minced or cut
and after  the designation of origin may be limited to a simple indication of ec origin with no mention of the country
this is a good move
the amendments will be adopted
the unwillingness of the commission is however with apologies to the commissioner apparent to everyone
as a solution labelling is a good idea only at first sight
the only effective protection would be checks and this requires states and frontiers
i just hope ladies and gentlemen that no one will have to be punished in future
previously one could be punished at the stake now punishment would mean a steak a british beefsteak
mr president this debate on the labelling of beef is closely akin to our previous concerns on the subject of food safety
finally it is essential that these measures should be implemented as quickly as possible since it is a matter of consumer rights
let us not delay especially as this is no recent matter
it is high time we took action
consumer confidence cannot be decreed it must be earned
that is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass
any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers
farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that and so should the consumers
we will then be where we need to be
one of these measures is most definitely the use of a label indicating the member state
we simply need this
another positive step is if it could also be pointed out that there can be a time when confidence will be restored
but the most important consideration is that it does not just get us talking but that we should also do something about it
the work of mr papayannakis has already been praised here
we have plenty of examples of consumers not having always been given priority when it comes to food production
the single market and the free movement of goods provide more freedom of choice for the public and better markets for producers
in this case it is especially important that meat and processed meat products are among those products whose origin the consumer knows
many have mentioned here that the ec label is not enough and that more precise information is needed
i agree with this
it is absolutely essential to know what country the products are from
in addition the origin not only of meat products but of the ingredients used in processed meat must be shown as clearly as possible
labels must also be made compulsory as quickly as possible
the timetable that the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy is proposing is not too pressing
the member states should have already prepared themselves for it
the issue is also one of credibility when it comes to implementing joint resolutions in all member states
it is also about citizens confidence and belief that food quality is everything it should be
a bit of drive needs to be shown and no exceptions should be made in the case of cattle which graze in the mountains
until this is a reality consumers need to know precisely which country their meat comes from
i have tabled an amendment to the effect that the slaughterhouse s authorisation number should not be shown on the label
in this way i wished to ensure that small and mediumsized slaughterhouses could continue to supply meat to butchers
the authorisation number does not provide the consumer with any useful information and has no bearing upon traceability
as a farmer i am concerned that every consumer should be able to trace where his schnitzel has come from
such a system must be practicable if it is to achieve its objective
we must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice
because of the varying topography of europe its farmers must apply different working and production methods
take the example of summer pasturing in the alps
as we have said traceability must be guaranteed in all cases
i therefore hope that proposed amendment no  to article  second indent will be adopted by the entire house
it has already been adopted by the committee on the environment and in the committee on agriculture
mr president the discussion on labelling beef is quite loaded
an important question is whether the origin eu label should be permitted as an added option
the commission thinks it should
many in parliament believe that it is the country of origin that should be on the label
the background to this is the food crises
but i do not advocate scrapping the option of including origin eu on the label either
in my opinion we should choose another approach
there are of course other means of enforcing compliance but this method is far more direct
parliament has to keep an eye on compliance with the directives it produces
this approach has the added advantage that the origin eu label has a positive ring to it
if the producer prefers to indicate the country of origin nonetheless this is possible too
there are a number of additional arguments as to why origin eu labelling should be possible
i will not spend any time on this argument as it is not of key importance in my opinion
however i would like to ask your attention for a question of principle
the internal market is a large entity
the principle of mutual recognition is fundamental
mutual recognition requires trust and trust requires common standards especially in the case of food safety
if we prohibit the use of the origin eu label we would be resigning ourselves to a kind of renationalisation of the internal market
this is unacceptable in my view
all eu member states need to guarantee safe meat
origin eu is then a symbol for quality and i therefore advocate backing amendments nos  and 
we must put our own house our own part of the world in order
if we are not ready how can we expect others to be
today this transparency is applicable within the beef industry to two different but indissociable areas bse and labelling
tomorrow the european union is preparing to outline a test programme for all member states
in this context consumers would not understand the delays in the matter of labelling
let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here
i am convinced that the subject of beef labelling is no mere technical issue
finally what our fellow citizens are demanding is the right to information
this right to be informed is the natural counterpart to the development of trade and the proper exercise of competition
fortunately integral chain control icc is already wellknown in many countries
in my opinion this is not related to national borders
mentioning the relevant country region town village and so on and so forth is fine but let the consumer decide where he wants to buy the product
but it should not be an eu stipulation
i hope this will restore consumer confidence in beef especially after the bse crisis
i would like to see not only the country but also the region of origin on the label
i represent the west midlands which has some of the best beef in the world  herefordshire beef and shropshire beef
i should like to see that go on the label
i would oppose very strongly the idea that eu should be on the label and not the country and region of origin
i am also concerned about some of the words that might go on the label
one of those words is slaughtered
i wish we could find a new word for it
mr president i wish to begin by saying that i welcome the report
a european unionwide identification system for cattle is long overdue
i want to sound a note of caution
i come from an area in northern ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be
no system is a hundred per cent perfect so do not think you can bring that about
there will always be people out to abuse the system
that has been the case for centuries  and will continue
you can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability
i have a number of concerns
the first is who pays
it has not been borne by the retailer
the consumer will perhaps ultimately pay  but he or she may not
from that point of view it is expensive for those people
i have one further question of the commission
is it wise to renationalise the beef market or even to regionalise it within countries
i seriously question that point
we have fought for years within the european union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market
i challenge the commission tonight to answer that question
is this a wise move
what is going to be the situation on the beef market
as i said in northern ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations
the proposal as mr goodwill has said has two important aims
first to ensure the traceability of beef second to allow consumers to make a fully informed choice
unfortunately although the two aims are compatible there is some tension between them where the details of the regulation are concerned
for this reason whatever the final form of article  i regard amendments nos  and  as being of the first importance
a further  proposed amendments were subsequently submitted for this plenary sitting
i should like to start with the commission s views on the first  proposals
the commission is able to accept  of them
in another  proposed amendments i can see what your concerns are but the commission is unable to accept these amendments
however i shall ensure that the council is informed of your point of view
this applies for example to proposed amendment no 
the same applies to the information to be included on the label and to the interpretation of the concept of origin
finally proposed amendment no  under which the regulation would enter into force on  september  heads in exactly the same direction
the question of when compulsory indications of origin need to be introduced is an important point
i would point out in this respect that the committee on agriculture has recommended that they be introduced on  january 
i would therefore suggest that you reconsider the simplified labelling system
let us gain some experience with the system being proposed now and then we can consider this idea at a later date
if proposed amendment no  is accepted the regulation automatically enters into force on this date
proposed amendments nos  and  are therefore superfluous for technical reasons
in the end we would have  different national systems which runs completely counter to the internal market
proposed amendment no  refers to information on the use of antibiotics or stimulants and to fattening methods
this idea may look simple on paper but it is in fact extremely complicated to administer and more importantly to control
the commission would therefore prefer not to adopt this proposal
these amendments seek to reintroduce a formal approval procedure for voluntary information on labels
let me assure you that such amendments do not cause any particular problem because their purpose is to reinforce the administrative procedure
for the rest recent discussions in the council have gone in the same direction
i am therefore convinced that these proposed amendments will be taken on board by the council
from now on the commission will be acting as gobetween between the two decisionmaking institutions on this matter
with just over three months we do not have much time left for a final decision
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken on wednesday at  am
the sitting was closed at  am
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
mrs ludford are you sure your point of order is related to the minutes
madam president i signalled i wanted to raise a point of order although it is not actually on the minutes
this judgement is important not just for europe s past but also for its present
thank you mrs ludford
i am happy to take note of your point of order
but for the time being i would like comments to relate to the minutes so that we can adopt them
after that members are free to move any other points of order
that does not respect our own rules of procedure which allow only  members or a group to table amendments in plenary
first of all question time was put back to  pm then it was announced on the screen that it would begin at  pm
in the end it was after  pm before question time started
the first part was supposed to last  minutes according to the agenda but it lasted much longer
basically my problem is that i had questions down  as some other people did  to commissioner byrne
we had group meetings at the time and saw on the screen question  
but by the time i reached the plenary you had moved on automatically within a few minutes to question 
so five or six people had questions down to commissioner byrne but none of us were here to ask the questions
commissioner byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub
thank you mrs mckenna
i take note of your comment and will ensure this does not happen again
i would therefore ask the president to send our condolences to both the romanian and hungarian parliaments
at the same time we must be alert to the kind of environmental risks these natural catastrophes may entail for our common european environment
thank you mrs thors i am quite prepared to do so
madam president with rather more levity
could we find out why this has happened
it is so embarrassing
i know we campaigned for more school milk but on this occasion we did not want it here
thank you mr wynn i cannot answer you right now but i will have the matter investigated
thank you mrs laguiller
i will give the letter my utmost attention
even the position of my head affects audibility and i cannot really sit here listening with my head tilted to one side
the other request i have is for a technician to adjust the sound volume here
thank you mr paasilinna we will look into all that and check the sound system in general
the minutes were approved
igc
mr ribeiro e castro will present the motion
madam president ladies and gentlemen this report should not have been admitted
paragraph  of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards europe
we are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law starting here in this house
so how can we agree when the fundamental right of recourse to the courts is being threatened
this is not a question of internal affairs but external affairs of great importance
we are members of this house and we represent our electors
these are the elements particularly under threat in this report which wants to interfere with and discriminate between the statutes of the political parties
the very essence of europe is under threat
paragraph  ruins the whole text by defiling a very serious issue
is there any better proof that this report is totally inappropriate
we therefore propose in order to defend europe and the rule of law the immediate rejection of this report
thank you mr ribeiro e castro
does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral back to committee
that statement clearly infringes the fundamental right of every citizen and thus also of members to bring an action
thank you mr berthu
mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen the two rapporteurs wish to speak against this motion
other colleagues have tabled amendments with a view to voting against that paragraph and members may agree with those amendments
but i do not think it is right to move that a report is inadmissible because of one paragraph
i call on members to vote against this motion
i am pleased about that it is a major step forward
however i also believe that the strong language my fellow delegates are using is completely uncalled for
the eu countries have completely different cultures
in some countries parliament can draw up its own rules of procedure and one does not have the option of going to the court of justice
some countries have a different system
we have recital 
mr dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments
the uen group are welcome to vote against them and then we will see if it is left in or taken out
all in all i believe that there is no call for excessively strong language and i am also in favour of us rejecting this amendment
laughter and applause
if you feel dutybound to reject it you will have an opportunity to do so
i shall now put the motion presented by the union for europe of the nations group to the vote by roll call
parliament rejected the procedural motion
the intergovernmental conference attempts to answer just that question
the report you have before you today is significant in that it covers the following points
the first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the european union
we repeat and insist that the european union is both a union of states and a union of peoples
for some perhaps that may be a risky proposal
the fourth point concerns a number of new proposals despite the fact that the issues to which they relate had always been debated
i refer very specifically to closer cooperation
closer cooperation at least as we view it must comprise two main elements
i would also like to see closer cooperation in foreign policy issues and others as well
none of them is currently operative
our first demand is therefore that qualified majority be established with the assent of the european parliament
the court must be able to focus on the real legal issues and legal protection of eu subjects
sound and timely administration of justice is a vital component of the constitutional state
in the light of this the role of the european parliament should be upgraded to that of a fullyfledged legislative body and that of a fullyfledged european institution
these are in a nutshell the motives underlying the opinion issued by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
as rapporteur i am also delighted to note that the committee on constitutional affairs is on the same wavelength for the greater part of its principal report
unfortunately time constraints prevent me from going into any detail
 draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budgets
es madam president the conditions of my intervention in this plenary session are illustrative of the budgetary problem
i have just hurried from a meeting which according to the treaty does not exist
i am participating on behalf of parliament in the tripartite dialogue on the budget to set the budgetary guidelines
this is precisely the point we have raised on behalf of the committee on budgets
it is the adaptation of the treaty article  in particular to the real situation
we have spent twelve years practising with a timetable set by the interinstitutional agreements
specifically we must simplify the procedure in order to prevent the blocking of the budgetary procedure
when there are  members the current procedure will not work
we should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power
i would like to raise two points
so too however must be the role of parliament
my second point concerns energy
the commission has concluded that a coherent european energy policy has been lacking in the past
in addition the european parliament powers must be adequately enhanced
this means that the codecision procedure needs to apply to the euratom treaty too
so far the member states have had their own technical standards and regulations
unfortunately my proposal to this effect has not been included in the current report
we owe this to our citizens

it is very important to mention the social market economy as already indicated by mr von wogau
it provides a kind of framework for internal policy which we need and renders a whole raft of discussions redundant
i believe that this results in satisfaction all round
the second major point is the union s legal personality
there are nonetheless two points that are lacking
one of them is the issue of article  which in my opinion should be repealed
there are also a number of amendments on the table which i hope will yet be added
i would like to finish off with a remark on the issue of the tax policy
the report in fact mentions very little about this
it is rather a pity in my opinion that we talk about it so little
maybe we will do so in future
that does not however detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report
 pt madam president ladies and gentlemen the work in the intergovernmental conference has been intensive
this is very encouraging for the future results of the igc
so far five main indepth meetings of the preparatory group have been held together with three meetings of the igc itself
the issue tackled at the last igc meeting was the question of extending qualified majority voting
the member states demonstrated a certain openness towards this but many have still not made a definitive decision
debates on these issues reveal that there is actually significant reticence although this may be overcome during the igc
the study of possible amendments to the treaty in respect of the court of auditors the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions has also been started
the delegations are divided into those which want to keep the informality of this undertaking and those which want the process to be enshrined in the treaty
these are the population and the existence of sovereign states
the eu is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states
the next informal meeting of the representatives group on  and  april in sintra portugal will deal specifically with this issue which is problematic as there are no examples to follow
close contact has been maintained with the commission and the european parliament
this augurs well for the success of our work
mr president with the dimitrakopoulos  leinen report under discussion the european parliament is declaring its great vision for the european union of the future
this is a truly historic moment as has been stressed
our fellowcitizens are waiting to be told what we are going to demand from the intergovernmental conference for that future
the draft resolution is therefore quite right to define that basic view in the form of three principles
according to the draft the european union is first and foremost a union of peoples and a union of states
its citizens therefore have both a european and a national identity
secondly it is based on an institutional equilibrium between large and small states
that must not be just on paper
thirdly the way the union functions must be made more effective so that it can cope with the major enlargement
anyone who ignores that is building a europe founded on sand
the intergovernmental conference of  is taking place to make the union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided
in this process parliament s responsibility is very great indeed
for that reason parliament s approval of enlargement cannot but depend on the adequacy of the institutional changes that will be decided
that is not a threat it is a declaration of responsible attitude
but is it enough for procedures to be simplified and speeded up for them to be described as effective
the effectiveness of democratic institutions is not measured either with a stopwatch or according to the number of decisions taken
it is measured by the degree of legitimacy
for that reason the extent to which these procedures can be simplified and speeded up is restricted by the whole complex system of dual legitimacy
we must bear that in mind tomorrow when we come to vote on the amendments and the text
these issues can only be resolved by a greater sense of trust between partners  such trust that is the essential glue of successful federal pacts
this trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new member states
the liberal group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the commission to build up the extra trust required
we support the main thrust of this report
liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of european parliamentary democracy
but we will be savage critics of those who prefer narrow selfinterest and threaten the accession of new member states
mr president the european parliament does not take part in intergovernmental conference negotiations
it plays a secondary role as do all those who are not part of a national government
this report only partly achieves this objective and this is why our group was not able to be unanimous in its final assessment
in this regard we hope that our amendment will find consensus in the house
mr president our group wishes to thank the rapporteurs messrs dimitrakopoulos and leinen for the important work which they have carried out
i must also tell them that within my group there are differing views according to differing national experiences
i will say the same thing here that i have said in my group the debate is not whether we say yes or no to federalism
the debate is how to go about european construction at the point of enlargement
we must create a fully democratic institutional fabric
we know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable
the intergovernmental conference cannot end with the same disappointment that we had in amsterdam
we cannot create an amsterdam 
this is the great challenge for the european institutions and for european politics
my vision of european construction is compatible with the fundamental lines which are laid out in the report which we are discussing today
it is of course necessary to give the commission the powers it needs and make it responsible to parliament this is precisely the issue
mr president parliament does not take a corporate position
the charter of fundamental rights must give citizens the capacity to demand compliance with these rights in the european courts
this is the position which we can adopt in our group asking for more efficiency and more democracy
it is not to trot out the old federalist recipes of the european movement yet again
it is not to propose a superstate again with its own constitution uniform rules and majority decisions
unfortunately it would seem that the latest debates within the most wellinformed groups of society stop at the doors of this parliament
we must adopt a more positive approach
mr president in denmark there is a concept known as asset stripping
asset stripping is a punishable offence
the asset under our constitutions is the right of voters to be heard and to choose representatives who can pass laws on our behalf
if we are dissatisfied with the laws we can choose new representatives and obtain new laws
electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions but is not being transferred to the european parliament
we parliamentarians have been sidetracked
power lies with the commission and the council of ministers
the eu is not a parliamentary democracy and the national parliaments have been still further marginalised
a number of us in this house have therefore prepared  proposals for democratic reform of the eu
we call the initiative sos democracy  sos because it is a matter of urgency and democracy because that is the heart of the problem
we do not have democracy in today s eu
we should like to have it in tomorrow s
we have different opinions as to how the laws should look
the voters in our countries should always have the last word
join us in sos democracy
we would like to make three points
secondly the importance of transport
lastly the role of tourism for both the economy and for employment
mr president i would first of all like to express my appreciation for the sterling work carried out by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen
i am making this statement as former rapporteur on the maastricht treaty
just try one of the pavement cafes and you will see what i mean
i will repeat this to mrs frassoni in italian some time
as far as our group is concerned the resolution needs to be amended on a number of points
one commissioner per member state seems a much better solution to us
in order to boost citizens confidence in the european commission it is vital that each member state should have a commission member
our group too has therefore tabled amendments to this effect
next is the number of meps
the resolution argues in favour of the possibility of european lists
it is important that we retain a maximum of  with or without the european list
parliament is already vast the buildings are already packed and the whole thing has to remain workable
the third point concerns the issue of unanimity
we would also thank the commission for this support
i would like to end by commenting on the charter of fundamental rights
according to our group it is of paramount importance that this charter be included in the treaty
this is a key issue for the citizens of europe
this debate is going on between political and national groups in different member states
please allow me to make a correction mr president there are no large and small countries here
here were are all amongst small countries especially given the challenge of globalisation
i believe this should be an important element in our coexistence
therefore this is an important debate and i believe the council should take account of the position we take
i have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the leftovers from amsterdam
leftovers are thrown in the bin
we must not allow a situation where while we are discussing this a kind of loch ness monster reappears every month in the press
here the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections
this is the risk taken by minister gama commissioner barnier and by all of us
i believe that it is important for all of the institutions to confront this issue responsibly
if not the intergovernmental conference will not have been a success for our future
mr president the eu is faced with enormous challenges
in just a few years time the union is to be enlarged to include almost double the number of member states
the euro is to be introduced
the intergovernmental conference should prepare the eu for these changes
it provides us with the opportunity to adapt our work to the new member states and to the new tasks we have before us
these are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the treaty of amsterdam
we must all make sacrifices in order to achieve this goal
unfortunately governments appear to have lost sight of this goal
the intergovernmental conference is making only limited progress which is not the fault of the portuguese presidency
the talk is already of the next intergovernmental conference where the major questions will then be solved
we have heard this before
there is starting to be a surfeit of halfbaked intergovernmental conferences
our citizens have higher expectations than that and we do not have much time
that is why we have to take the opportunity now
quite simply the eu must become more liberal
the report includes many of our amendments and i support these with few exceptions
the challenges faced by the eu are exciting and historic
they should inspire us all to roll up our shirt sleeves
instead however of awakening hope and enthusiasm present developments appear rather to be giving rise to anxiety among governments
one might well ask what has become of political leadership and vision
i am convinced that this transformation of the eu into a federal state is a blind alley in every way
the eu s major problem today is not a lack of centralised power but a shortage of real democracy
through the treaty changes proposed in the resolution the eu would become a union wholly dominated by the big member states
the power wielded by the major countries would be increased dramatically through the introduction of a system of double simple majority voting in the council of ministers
their power would also be increased through the increase in their representation in the european parliament
this would mean that in many member states important political powers would not be represented at eu level
this also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a parliament would be
for anyone who wants to change anything regarding monetary union or emu it is now when the treaty is being changed that the opportunity exists
it is noticeable that they are now completely silent and that it is now only the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left which is demanding the democratisation of monetary union
as you have perhaps noted i am going to vote against the present resolution
the president cut the speaker off
i know that reform within the existing european institutions must take place
however any changes within the internal decisionmaking procedures must be balanced and fair
for example the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the european commission
this will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller member states to have one member of the commission will be downgraded
i do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal
 million citizens of the union have an affinity with the commission
certainly from an irish perspective irish people recognise the importance of the commission as an institutional body within the european union
the union must draw nearer to the citizens of the union
i would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at european council level
i believe that national member states should retain the right of veto on taxation matters
the irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates
mr president a biblical parable teaches the reader to build his house on a rock
after all a house built on sand has no solid foundations
this parable was meant as a reference to faith and its foundations
nonetheless i was reminded of this parable during the igc discussion
the relentless attempts to turn europe into a political unity seem to be built on quicksand
indeed the citizens of europe do not feel european and this will not change overnight
still the discussion on the eu s future is peppered with concepts such as european citizenship
this does not exist by any stretch of the imagination and is simply quicksand
in the igc discussion or the present report for that matter the end goal of european cooperation is not taken into consideration
what do we want to achieve as a european union
i would be keen to hear the council s and commission s opinion on this
i share the minority view of mr berthu a member of the union for a europe of nations group as it has been included in this report
degrading acceding countries to secondclass members does not do them justice and has unwanted political consequences
another specific point i would like to raise concerns the european commission
this high official college should in future not have more or fewer than  members
if necessary combinations of countries can alternate in appointing a euro commissioner
this must however go hand in hand with sound scrutiny by the national parliaments of their own ministers in the council
these are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised
we are overloading the wish list of the igc
we believe the igc should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms
the presidentinoffice addressed some of these concerns in his speech
commissioner barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms not necessarily to conclude them
some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform
our priority is enlargement
we should not confuse or reverse our priorities
mr president my group welcomes this report
the report puts forward ambitious proposals as one would expect of the european parliament
the commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely
so the report is balanced and i think can be welcomed
it is ambitious
some people are saying the igc will never agree to this point or to that point 
that is essential for our future
mr president the aim of the igc is to reconcile enlargement with deepening
unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature
closer cooperation must make it possible to manage diversity and avoid getting bogged down without calling the fundamental structure of the union into question
the report by our fellow members whom i want to congratulate has been substantially improved over the course of the discussions
nonetheless the outlined reform will hit the small member states hardest
that applies in particular to the provisions on the composition and operation of the institutions
a parliament in which the ceiling of four seats per member state which does not allow for a balanced representation of the political forces is unacceptable
lastly let me bring up the question of the seat of parliament and call for the promise made to be respected
that is something which the parties of european free alliance have in common and our votes will be cast in that light
i want to draw attention particularly to amendment no  in its interaction with paragraph  of the dimitrakopoulosleinen report
as it is now voting time the debate will be adjourned and will resume at  pm
vote
parliament adopted the resolution
the president declared the common position approved
simplified procedure without report
parliament approved the commission proposal
parliament approved the commission proposal
the president declared the common position approved
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
wallstrom commission
mr president as i explained during the debate yesterday the commission is able to accept fully amendments nos     and 
some of these amendments need only to be brought into line with the legal wording of the text of the directive and the overall legislative framework
the commission is unable to accept amendments nos  to    to    to   to   to   to   and 
i have the council s common position of  december  before me
it says in the document passed to us by the council that this common position was adopted unanimously
political union took place in june  under the german council presidency also with a green environment minister
laughter applause
thank you mr liese
it is that very common position
mr president since mr liese has addressed a question to us i will take the liberty of answering him
the green group is not dependent on the positions of the green ministers represented in the environment council
we have freedom of choice and i would hope the same applies to all the political groups here present
but i wanted to speak specifically on the vote on amendment no 
so i believe it would be more logical to vote first on the amendment that departs furthest from the original position
mr lannoye the rapporteur discussed this question with the competent services yesterday
he does not seem to agree with you
i can only regret that
after the vote on amendments nos  and  president
we will now adjourn the vote and resume after the formal sitting
the sitting was suspended at  noon for the formal sitting and resumed at  pm
mr president i understand perfectly that it is an honour for us to receive a distinguished guest of state
i would urge you to address this matter in the bureau
i am happy to put this question to the bureau mrs rothbehrendt but i was bound by decisions outside my control
mr president just before the formal sitting you interrupted this vote very suddenly
we have just seen the first vote after the formal sitting fail to secure a qualified majority by only a handful of votes
does that not demonstrate what we were talking about and the point mrs rothbehrendt has raised
when we have qualified majority votes they should not be interrupted in any way by the formal sitting
there were eight votes to go
i can inform you on the basis of my experience that you could have completed that in three minutes
i hope you could address that issue mr president
i quite understand your feelings mr bowe
to tell the truth i agree with you
but i also had to respect the protocol which once again unfortunately often takes precedence over our proceedings
mr president i have a question about the method applied here
in principle mrs lienemann the bell sounds when the sitting has been adjourned in order to call members back
some members had left the chamber others remained
i had in fact announced that the voting would resume immediately after the formal sitting
moreover this was indicated in the minutes and on the agenda
but i too am sometimes faced with imponderables
let me assure you that all your comments will be passed on to the bureau
you yourself are a member of the bureau
i think that by taking concerted action we will manage to improve the system
mixed reactions
mr president if the problem about sounding the bell is that the sitting has to resume first the solution is quite simple
i propose to the president that we suspend the sitting for two minutes
for it is unacceptable
applause

joint motion for a resolution on the euafrica summit
before the vote
mr president an error has slipped into paragraphs   and  of this joint resolution of the european union and africa
in paragraph  instead of saying the oau it should say the african states 
in section  instead of the oau it should say africa 
in section  members of the oau should be replaced by africans 
parliament agreed to vote on the oral amendment
parliament adopted the resolution explanations of vote
resolution on the additionality principle
mr president i would like to give the following explanation of the vote that i cast in the debate concerning additionality
this matter urgently calls for review by the commission
i am very glad about that
i should like to congratulate my colleague mrs evans for setting up this marvellous debate and getting this superb result today
paragraph a continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of cofinancing
paragraph g is inaccurate
my party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this
agricultural statistics for the period 
mr president of course it is important if not essential for the european union to be engaged in statistics
checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road
young people lack experience and are certainly at greater risk than the elderly
recommendation for second reading bowe a
in any case no one has ever succeeded in blocking the advance of science
for this reason in the interests of the elderly i would call for less stringent regulation of gmos
there are major issues at stake
the argument has been made that this issue should instead be covered by horizontal legislation
it is worth noting however that we have heard this argument since discussions about directive eec first started in 
we must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes
this would mean that antibioticresistant products that have already been authorised would remain
the directive should take a clear stand and insist that the use of these marker genes is stopped now
the pharmaceutical industry wants a total exemption from the directive
but the least we could have expected was for parliament now to decide to take serious steps to protect the consumer
nothing of the kind has happened however
the european parliament has just given way on three vital issues in circumstances i consider shameful
that tells us something
i have never seen an insurer refuse to insure a nonexistent risk
i warmly congratulate mr bowe on his report on the deliberate release into the environment of gmos
yet this is a positive first step since it has led several large firms to stop putting gmos into their products
the proposals of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy set out a strict and transparent framework thus responding fully to consumer concerns
the purpose of the three main amendments i support is as follows
to prevent any accidental contamination of fields by crosspollination between gmo and nongmo crops
to prevent any risk of antibiotic resistance developing as a result of the transfer of the resistant gene from one species to another
so we must ban the release of all gmos containing an antibioticresistant marker gene
to impose a strict liability system on producers
given the uncertainties that remain in this area we must be as prudent as we can
let me conclude by repeating and emphasising that we must listen to what the people of europe expect of us
so we must be the spokespeople of this desire to preserve highquality food in the european union
it is good that the council common position already incorporates some of the amendments approved by the european parliament
however as proposed by the rapporteur the amendments approved at first reading but not accepted by the council must now be included
the three key issues covered in mr bowe s report are environmental liability antibiotics and gene transfer
the path may one day prove to have led to something which is the total opposite of all the promises which were given when the journey was begun
i want to issue this warning today
since  the commission s proposals have been under discussion
further delays would be a mistake
our political decisions must instead be guided by the concept of stewardship and not by manipulation of the genetic code
our task is to hand the earth and the environment over to future generations in as good a state as possible
 sv it is an important report which parliament has voted on today
the directive guarantees a high level of protection
nothing is so enduring as the accidental
i therefore consider it very important to devise general regulations governing liability for environmental damage
this will ensure that other species are protected
industry should pay and face the consequences of its actions not the manonthestreet
europe should stand up for the rights of the citizen and force industry to take responsibility
of course the health and wellbeing of our citizens is of paramount importance
i say no to the release of gmos resistant to antibiotics
we must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk
labour euro mps have been at the forefront of protecting our citizens and our environment
papayannakis report a
mr president i voted for the measure on the labelling of beef
at last we are going to be told the place of birth and residence of the cattle and doubtless whether they were called daisy or buttercup
let us place photographs of our citizens inside all the bureaucratic files with which the states fill our offices
through this system consumers can obtain information about the origin of the meat which they buy and the background of the animal can be checked
it is essential that identical labelling rules are applied to beef imported from third countries
this system should enable any potential threats to human health to be tackled early and effectively
consumers need to have confidence in the food they eat
let us look back for a moment at the embargo on beef
although one swallow does not make a summer in this case the french government gave precedence to reason and caution over the ideology of the single market
knowing the options that exist in matters european we can gauge what that must have cost it
should the general public trust a commission that does not ensure the compulsory traceability of beef yet lifts the embargo
we note with satisfaction that some of the amendments we tabled in the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment were adopted
the committee on the environment amended important points of the commission proposal
it is high time we set up a reliable and transparent system
we hope that today s vote will not lead to new and shameful calls for an extension or a derogation a few months hence
food safety is a top priority and we must work hard towards alleviating the fears of consumers
these new proposals enable consumers to trace the source of the meat they buy right back to the animal
this should allow for any possible health threats to be tackled early and effectively
public confidence in food safety has fallen tremendously in the past
we must of course put safety first and also make moves towards rebuilding public confidence
lisbon european council
with regard to social security i would have preferred it if the decision had at last been taken to create a single european pension for the union
when the european citizens grow old all the governments abuse them
they are told off for living too long whereas the real problem is that their contributions have been wasted
 fr the lisbon summit was supposed to focus on a social europe
in short everything should be quoted on the stock exchange
and this was done with the complicity of all the leftwing governments present in lisbon
to sugar the pill the eu is promising us quasigeneral access to the internet and cuttingedge vocational training
employers for their part will once again enjoy quite indecent subsidies
a new economy but we are being served up the same old recipes again
in addition it will be capable of improving citizens quality of life and the environment
however it is equally true that without active intervention this shift will widen the gap between the haves and havenots
the lisbon summit created enormous expectations
if only these promises could be fulfilled
we share these expectations but we should also like to be able to congratulate the practical results achieved
on this score only the future will tell
yet we already regret certain weaknesses
these thoughts are reflected in our votes and the amendments tabled
that is not investing in people as the summit meeting would have it
on the contrary it is preparing working people and this indeed at a fast rate to live in a situation of complete and permanent insecurity
euafrica summit in cairo
mr president i voted against the motion for a resolution on the euafrica summit for several reasons
this is the only way to end the suffering of a people who are as entitled as anyone to human dignity and happiness
 fr this cairo summit is the first meeting at the level of the eu and the african continent as a whole
yet the eu persists in wanting to divide africa between the mediterranean area and black africa
during this neocolonial transition period the eu is seeking to impose a system of neoliberal relations dominated by liberalisation and structural adjustments
that brings us to the end of the explanations of vote
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
in a fair and respectful manner i must also criticise the behaviour of our president i have the highest respect for her but she must also respect us
she must realise that being president of the european parliament does not make her the leader of the majority
she represents this institution and must act and speak in this house with respect for all the different positions expressed here
she is not the leader of the majority and i must therefore register my protest
mr ribeiro e castro your views will certainly be conveyed to the council and to the president
igc continuation
madam president tomorrow i am going to vote for the dimitrakopoulosleinen report
however if i were asked to give my opinion on the overall status of the situation in europe i would have to say that i am somewhat confused and concerned
there is no longer even any question of the creation of a different state it is history which must change course
there is no point in denying anything in this case either
madam president as far as the budget is concerned it is becoming increasingly essential that we bring the treaty up to date with the procedures
let us remember that the financial perspectives procedure has brought budgetary stability to the european union
if we do not do this we will run the risk of confusing the financial perspectives with the annual budgets
this confusion will lead to conflict year after year
the european parliament wants the community budget to be financed by own resources rather than by contributions from the member states
progressiveness cannot only be based on expenditure
sooner or later we will have to be sufficiently progressive in terms of own resources as a basis for this fair tax system
madam president we are usually very quick to criticise the commission or the council when they do not attend our debates but this time ironically the finger seems to be pointing the other way
i am aware that these days are extremely tiring for all concerned but duty comes before everything else
i listened to mr segni s speech
we are on the brink of an historic occasion where the risks are great but so are the opportunities
this is the real challenge
clearly a substantial amount of responsibility would fall to our president and to the french presidency
madam president why is the gulf between the european parliament and the european governments so wide
there is an excellent resolution on the table which refers to the many necessary reforms
cooperation should be more flexible and each member state must retain a commissioner
they have contributed to a climate of euroscepticism where there is no room for compromise
as such many european politicians are hostage to their own rhetoric
we are the representatives of the people
madam president aside from the letter of the report i want to draw attention to a few of the numbers contained in it
first number 
limiting the number of members of the european parliament to  would not be a cause for concern were it not that it would render our parliament less representative
we must reaffirm that it is our parliament s prime and absolute task to represent the people and the peoples of europe in all their diversity
second number two thirds
two thirds of the vote is the majority required for our parliament to censure the commission
this very high threshold of two thirds is a sad and unique case
for what european government can boast of being so safe from any real parliamentary control of having such impunity
we must create a formal symmetry
if a simple majority is good enough for the investment of the commission then the same majority should suffice for a vote of no confidence
the people s representatives have the power to undo anything they have done
that is the rule everywhere and it must be the rule here too
third and last number 
the report proposes the year  as the date for electing meps from transnational lists
otherwise we would be being neither lucid nor ambitious enough
nor does this report which without being bad does not match up to the issues at stake seem very lucid or ambitious
in changing size the european union will change in nature
so our continent will have to rethink its rules rather than simply tidy them up
this timid igc  can in no way represent an end result but only the first step towards a constitution
madam president ladies and gentlemen we should go back to basics and ask ourselves what makes the european union different
over the centuries many attempts were made by some countries to dominate others
ideas may have varied according to the times and individual countries interests but the system stayed the same with power for some and subjugation for others
we suffered centuries of war and even destruction and ruin on several occasions
many times we had to start over and it was the last time this happened that the european idea came into being
so what is different
the answer is everything
we have a system based on mutual freedom for everyone instead of supremacy for some
we have a framework agreed between nations and not one imposed on the nations
we therefore have a permanent contract between free and sovereign states which are all equal
instead of changing majorities we have the rules of a stable contract in which we are all minorities
the price is patience which is a small price to pay for such great results
it would be wrong to strip away the rules of the game which have brought us so much success to date
in my opinion the motion for a resolution is a dangerous antieurope deviation which completely alters the balance
for europe in general it would mean a crisis or breakdown
we want an open europe not one tied in a straitjacket
finally i must mention the idea of transnational european parties
as a conservative christian democrat i stand as a witness against this my party the popular party or cdspp founded the ppe
some years ago we were expelled from the ppe because we advocated a referendum on maastricht
what a frightening idea of democracy
we need to be careful for federalism is so dazzling that it destroys with its hands those concepts which it asserts with its own mouth
this is because it covets power and ignores partnership and we cannot go down this road
the most important consideration regarding enlargement in the dimitrakopoulosleinen report is increased flexibility
only differentiation within the eu can create the preconditions necessary for enlargement on such a massive scale
it is important that the report proposes that closer cooperation should be facilitated
this would facilitate and speed up enlargement of the union
at this stage it is not necessary to adopt a precise position on how the union should be differentiated
it is enough for now that we create an institutional framework in which it is possible to deepen and expand the union in practical terms
i hope that amendment no  which the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party has tabled regarding increased flexibility will be adopted
how can this parliament which represents all european citizens rule out its own full legislative initiative
why is the exercise before the union of the powers of the national authorities federal states and autonomous communities not recognised
how can we deny the establishment of a european employment policy linked to the structural funds policy
these questions are useful to highlight some of the grave deficiencies in the legislative proposal on reforming the treaties
madam president mr presidentinoffice of the council commissioner what are the issues at stake in this intergovernmental conference
manifestly the first and main issue is the quality of the decisionmaking process in the union
here we attach the utmost importance to extending the scope of qualified majority voting
but we have to acknowledge that undoubtedly we will also need this instrument
of course we can only be delighted at this
but you will find these same questions coming up again in other discussions you will be holding during the intergovernmental conference
let me make one more point before concluding madam president
i want to sound the alarm about the progress in drafting the charter of fundamental rights we want to see incorporated in the treaty
it is most important to incorporate that charter
madam president this is a strange uncomfortable and schizophrenic report
how much of this schizoid quality reflects the positions of the two rapporteurs is hard to estimate
however the majority of my conservative colleagues have voted to reject the report and will vote accordingly in this house
the conservative delegation regards many of the ideas in the report as centralising syndicalist unnecessary and backwardlooking
that is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions
they too are often strange uncomfortable and schizophrenic but they remain the best we have all the same
firstly to generalise the system of dual simple majority voting is not the panacea of the future integration of europe
it would be better to seek a compromise acceptable to all as in the past
it is a question of legitimacy and acceptability
secondly member states with a large population get more than their fair share
the underlying principle of one man  one vote is unacceptable
it is a question of equality and solidarity
finally there is no serious argument to back up the thesis we keep being served up namely that a commission of more than  members would not work
equally in the case of the commission let us avoid making numbers into an absolute principle
the important vote we will be holding tomorrow will i hope enable the european parliament to put an end to this ambiguity and to make some adjustments
only a more politically realistic proposal will have a chance of being taken into consideration
igc  is not the end of the story
today the european union which the founding fathers conceived achieved and then bequeathed to us must evolve and change
europe is at a crossroads
either we content ourselves in future with being merely a free trade area or we seek to construct a political europe
but let us make no mistake if we choose to sit on the fence we are likely to see the worst scenario
it is up to us the elected representatives of the people of europe to work towards improving the efficiency and democracy of our institutions
but europe will only be democratic if the people themselves determine the principles and rules of its organisation
madam president i would first of all like to thank both rapporteurs
long before the igc was launched the dutch social democratic delegation had already taken an active interest in the igc
we have held large public debates in the netherlands and have done a great deal of groundwork
after all the igc should prepare the union for enlargement and this enlargement will require the current member states to make sacrifices
in addition it should of course bring europe closer to its citizens because the distance between brussels and our citizens is still far too great
the igc should therefore make up the democratic shortfall
simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen
this is provided for in amendment no 
another subject which is close to our hearts is that of making closer cooperation more flexible
it is clear that the de facto veto currently inherent in this procedure must go
in our opinion the report does not go far enough regarding another point namely that relating to individual responsibility which must be granted by commissioners
we firmly believe that it must be possible for parliament to issue a strong warning to a commissioner who loses the confidence of parliament
we think that ultimately our compromise has struck a sound balance between small and large member states
we hope that this will receive support from this parliament
madam president enlargement is important for the people of europe
we must therefore find a way of cooperating throughout europe
the accession negotiations are now under way
it is therefore important that it should be possible to conclude the intergovernmental conference before the end of the year
both large and small states must be able to exercise influence in the future eu
we must strike a balance
this is necessary if our citizens are to have confidence in european cooperation
if the composition of the european parliament is to be adjusted i therefore advocate a proportional degressive reduction in the number of members
all present member states must be included and make their contribution
i therefore recommend a system which takes account of differences in the size of the population
it is important that each country should have a member in the commission
the commission must therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the member states
eu cooperation is in the first place a civil european project and ought to be distinguished from anything of a military nature
the member states do have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned
it is therefore important that the treaty should reflect the difference between civil and military cooperation
a european military alliance should not therefore be created within the framework of the eu s institutions but between individual states
military support of a kind which places states under an obligation to each other has no place in the eu s treaties
it is now also at the top of the agenda prior to the swedish presidency
i would thank you commissioner barnier for your efforts which in fact help me to take an optimistic view of europe s future development
madam president we have a very challenging task before us
we have to strike a balance between efficiency democracy and member state equality
above all we have to be able to restore confidence of our citizens in decision making in the european union
this will come about by increasing genuine transparency and by developing the way administration actually serves the people
we have seen that matters of taxation for example have become stumbling blocks
it is hard to understand why we cannot introduce a reasonable tax on capital in europe
at present capital is like a dog off its leash
we all have a lot to gain and protect in a common europe
we also have to cling to the notion of european solidarity for as long as possible in changing circumstances
in my opinion we need more than that
madam president the constitutional questions we are debating today are highly controversial as the vote in committee clearly shows
in fact  members voted for and  voted against
of the latter  voted against and  abstained
that is not something to be proud of
but unlike talleyrand i cannot console myself with the idea that what is exaggerated is by the same token insignificant
i want to dissociate myself from demands such as that we should cut my country s delegation in the european parliament by one third
with  members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country
moreover we cannot sit on all the committees
the idea of european lists is premature if not harebrained
in the case of a qualifiedmajority council decision it is inconceivable to provide for a simple majority of member states
there can be no question of restricting unanimous council voting to decisions of a constitutional nature
we must also retain majority voting for fundamental questions such as own resources taxation and so forth
i hope the idea of not allocating one commissioner to each member state is well and truly dead
i will not vote for this shopping list unless it is amended along the lines i have just set out
i believe that our report is more serious
i do not believe that the proposals which we make in this report are extravagant
they are consistent with what this parliament has always demanded more democracy and efficiency for the european union
we fortunately have the opportunity to improve these points tomorrow in plenary
i warmly congratulate the rapporteurs on their work
my second point is directed at the presidentinoffice
congratulations mr presidentinoffice
comments were made about the council s absence during the address by the austrian president to this parliament
we did not have any indication from the president of this house that we should attend for what was purely a parliamentary matter
this was totally obvious from my intervention in this house when this issue was first debated
this point is very important
from that point of view as i had hoped the portuguese presidency has proved itself to be in no way an interim or secondary presidency
and from that point of view i want to thank the council
madam president ladies and gentlemen i just want to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate
we are well aware that this equilibrium is both necessary and difficult to achieve
we have gone beyond the search for an equilibrium and proposed an egalitarian solution in relation to the composition of the commission
that ladies and gentlemen remains our aim to establish an equilibrium between the small and the large states
in that regard i share the concerns expressed by a number of speakers
second concern the role of the european parliament as the driving force as referred to by jo leinen
opportunities must also be created to convince and speak to the national parliaments
president napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference
so we must take the time to reflect carefully about what we are doing
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
famine in ethiopia
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on the famine in ethiopia
this intervention is very important in tackling the problem of nearly  million people currently at risk throughout this area
commissioner patten will explain at the appropriate moment in this debate the actions which the commission has planned or has been developing
these actions are very important and have been implemented in time
the decisions were also taken at the right time
both the directorategeneral for development and echo have already sent enough food to satisfy the most urgent needs
we cannot separate from this issue the current political and military position in ethiopia
as i said the european union has been monitoring this situation
however these concerns are the centre of attention not only for the commission but also for the council
a meeting was held yesterday in brussels of a group of experts specifically to analyse the best ways of tackling this situation
there were representatives from echo the directorategeneral for development and the member states of the european union
we are monitoring this issue
i am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate  grateful but sad that the debate is necessary at all
i am standing in for my colleague commissioner nielson who would have liked to have been able to respond himself
for me there is an awful sense of deja vu  or perhaps i should say deja entendu  about this debate today
over a decade ago from  to  i was my country s development minister
i know that there are a number of honourable members in this house who have done the same job for their own countries
i was speaking in similar debates then tackling similar crises in the horn of africa
it is a lethal mix
it is capable of producing hunger and misery on a massive scale
we face the same old frustrations as i said in the chamber yesterday
so we improve our capacity to deal with the humanitarian problems in spite of the difficulties
but alas we are still incapable of preventing the humanitarian problems arising in the first place  very often problems with largely political causes
that is the frustration
let me set out for honourable members what we are doing to alleviate the present crisis
they will be making recommendations on our future efforts
the ethiopian government has asked for   tonnes of food aid  more than in recent years
this amount is nearly covered by existing pledges by the international community
the real figure is more than three times that
that is the background
it is important to be aware of it
there have been a number of allegations about an inadequate european response to the crisis
i hope that letter gets wider circulation
it is important to remember that point
what matters most is not to rake over these old controversies
what matters most is what we are doing right now to get help to the starving
a further shipment of over   tonnes through euronaid is due to arrive on sunday
this will be followed by further shipments through djibouti and berbera in view of the limited porthandling capacity
this quantity should be sufficient to meet immediate needs
total donor pledges as i said earlier are over   metric tonnes
so that is what we are doing
djibouti is expected to be congested with the arrival of   metric tonnes over the next three months
we are also considering using the port of sudan
road improvements are under way on the sudanese side and roads on the ethiopian side are reported to be quite good
they will have our unstinting assistance
i am afraid that i should add that experience suggests that they need our prayers as well
madam president i wish to begin by welcoming commissioner patten s statement which sets out the truth about our european assistance
who does one negotiate with in such a situation
of course we must do everything in our power to alleviate famine
we must watch the situation in eritrea and balance humanitarian aid there if required
i recently spent a week in both ethiopia and eritrea
when i was there they were pleading for help
they were the lucky ones they were the ones with food
we never seem to learn a lesson from the past
perhaps this could be built into commissioner patten s rapid reaction unit we heard of yesterday
we must have action and we must have action decisively and urgently
madam president i gladly concur with the previous speakers mr patten and mr corrie
we all witnessed the fight against hunger ten years ago
the least both parties could do is to impose an absolute freeze on military activity
both have a great deal of logistical experience expertise and knowhow
according to them we are entirely to blame
they are jointly responsible
my second point concerns food
there is enormous pressure to send food fast and i mean fast
is there anything for sale locally in the region
after all anything we can get and arrange there will help their economy and will prevent the local situation from being distorted
because ultimately that is what causes the structural hardship which accompanies these wars
it is not easy
everyone knows that but it could be an enormous bonus in removing the image of inadequacy when we handle such situations
ethiopia and eritrea bear the ultimate responsibility
i give my full backing to any action undertaken by the commission on this score
mr president commissioner patten wonders why africa s fateful history keeps repeating itself  with good reason
millions of people are again threatened with starvation
this is not just caused by extreme drought
the blinkered ethiopian government in particular contributes through its obstinacy to the suffering of its own people
how else can you explain the fact that ethiopia rejected the offer to use the ports of massawa and assab
as a result aid is now unable to reach a large part of its own population
an ethiopian minister has said that the international community does not spring into action until the skeletons appear on television
i am pleased that commissioner patten has addressed the criticism to the effect that european aid is inadequate
despite this i would like to ask him what lessons he has learnt from how europe responded this time round
it is difficult not to despair in the face of the misery in the horn of africa
we should nonetheless not lose hope
nature can only destroy where people fail
after all war and mismanagement are down to people
africa s fateful history does not have to repeat itself provided that people s lives take priority over the feuds among its shameless leaders
why do we still allow this to happen
do we not have a conscience
every day the european union provides less funding less aid in global terms to the poor countries of africa
so how can we be surprised at this situation
there are reasons to justify this but none of them justifies the death of a single person from starvation
it is not true that we show solidarity
no
i am not saying anything new
when will we have a marshall plan for africa
yet we cannot relax
the donors including the european union are said not to have kept their promises
i share the commissioner s view that the reproach made by addis ababa is misplaced to say the least
it is high time that the ethiopian government faced up to its responsibility and made every effort to end the war with eritrea
it could then focus its attention on the economic and social development of the country and so be able to prevent famines such as these
mr president famine and ethiopia these are two words sadly etched in our memories
of course the   tonnes of emergency aid promised by the international community must be delivered as soon as possible
but at the same time the countries in the region must do their utmost to facilitate this delivery by opening up the ports supply routes and infrastructures
the sound of guns has for far too long drowned out the cries of the hungry
but at this moment of course we must simply listen to the appeals of the suffering people
mr president misery and death in ethiopia were on our screens four years ago
the cameramen left but misery and death did not leave ethiopia
starvation and death continue today
the population of ethiopia pray for rain
sadly they see only a rain of bullets
people crave water food and medicine
these politicians are hungry for power politicians who argue over territorial boundaries whilst their people die
famine disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries
hunger for power must not be allowed to override the hunger for life
mr patten has listed a number of measures the eu has taken to help
such help has been received with gratitude but let us put it into perspective
sixteen million people are starving today   tonnes have been delivered
i accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person
no time limit is given in other words it is a kilo that has to last forever
these measures are palliative
they only relieve the symptoms they do not cure the disease
the summit between the european union and the african countries was held just a few days ago
dialogue with the african authorities is essential as is dialogue with the subregional authorities
thank you very much minister
i would like to inform you that pursuant to rule   of the rules of procedure i have received five motions for resolutions
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday
stabilisation and association process for countries of southeastern europe
i would like to make a general comment regarding the conference
indeed regional development is one of the stability pact s key points
it was good to see allround commitment most definitely present at all the desks at the conference
this concludes my general comments on the funding conference
further to this conference i would like to single out five key points from my report
first of all the funding
everyone was waiting with bated breath for the moment when the commissioner would produce the amount
he finally came up with eur  million
in the final analysis therefore there was little new money in it
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner how the first year the year  is likely to take shape
how are the preparations for the stability pact budget coming along
i am in favour of retaining the figure of  billion for the time being
i am only very curious as to how the commission hopes to raise all this money
of  billion  has been set aside for reconstruction  for democracy and only  for safety
a mineclearance programme is part of safety is of key importance and should not be overlooked
what is the progress here
what does the commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term
fourthly the ngos
finally the distribution of tasks
who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently
i would like to give the commissioner a word of advice
last week he was accused of wanting to saw the legs from under commission president prodi s chair
in my view he has been given a leading role in the balkans for no good reason
the debate caused by this could not have come at a better time
the european union is by far the body which has contributed the most aid to this region
the eu is furthermore the main trading partner of all the countries in this region
the stabilisation and association agreements constitute a central point of this policy
as a result the rapporteur concludes that it will be necessary to create a type of mediumterm stabilisation and regional development programme
i am not necessarily convinced that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem
the general stabilisation process for the area cannot by any stretch of the imagination be reduced to just agreements
the idea underlying the stabilisation and association process is sufficiently broad and flexible to ensure a constant project in this area
this has not been the eu s experience in equivalent regional processes in the past
negotiations have already begun with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia on the stabilisation and association agreement
i should like to refer briefly to the new regulation
the recommendations to be made will form a valuable contribution to the debates which we will start within the council on this issue
these are the main objectives of our reconstruction strategy for the area which does not just involve a merely physical dimension but also an overall stabilisation dimension
of this amount the european union alone that is the commission and member states combined have promised or mobilised eur  billion
however the conference was only one initial step in a long process
this will allow economic and social development and progress in line with european standards
with the exception of belgrade all the governments in the region have stated that they will start on the road to reform
i must clarify however that the council considers that without serbia our common efforts will be incomplete
to conclude we also note that the rapporteur intends that the mandate of the european reconstruction agency should not be limited to kosovo
discussions are also ongoing about the possible extension of the eib s activities
now is not the time to pass judgement past events and situations
here however we must pay attention to certain issues
so what are these issues
in all circumstances this must be stopped by nonnegotiable political answers given in every direction
so what are they
firstly absolute compliance with the un s decisions on the area
that would lead to continued and lasting tension with no foreseeable end
a domino effect
thirdly our policy must concern the peoples and only them
that is what is also in europe s interests
fourthly the issue of economic and institutional reconstruction is an urgent priority
positive results will emerge through development democracy and prosperity
for the first time you are passing judgement on a complex problem at the very periphery of the european union
the eu s political credibility and competence must prove successful
it is a bet which must be won
mr president i would thank the rapporteur for a report that the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party can fully support
i am taking up this matter because not enough  although fortunately a little  has in actual fact been done in this area
i do not in fact believe that the project will succeed if that does not happen
in other words it essentially accepts that the wolf can guard the sheep
by its very nature the stability pact in eastern europe is intrusive on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being protected
they try either by force or by economic blackmail to terrorise peoples and subjugate them to the new order
and the question is this what principle of international law are they basing their actions on
mr president i would like to make three observations regarding mr lagendijk s inspiring and excellent report
firstly the stability pact for southeastern europe focuses on regional cooperation in the balkans
it is precisely this cooperation which the european union wishes to promote in the best possible way
well this regional cooperation still leaves too much to be desired
what is needed here is a powerful response from the european union
this should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects
secondly i consider paragraph  in the lagendijk report to be a fine idea
indeed the stability pact applies just as much across the borders of the region
as such the republic moldavia definitely deserves the opportunity of being directly involved in the pact
after all the alternative would be that moldavia would be in danger of finding itself in a kind of political no man s land
am i right in thinking that russia already subscribes to the stability pact for southeastern europe
mr president i will make three points
i think that the donor conference makes this possible or seems to at least
such issues should be considered by the european union as well
mr president i am not about to start arguing the toss with mr swoboda over where the balkans begin
in fact it was once said that the balkans begin at the rennweg in vienna
but leaving that aside the fact remains that this stability pact is of course adversely affected by the heterogeneity of its states
we have first and second wave candidate countries
we have countries such as croatia and macedonia that are about to overtake candidate countries
we cannot afford to hang about over this issue any longer otherwise all we will be doing is tinkering about at the edges as it were
what we need here is cooperation between our two institutions so as to strengthen the eu and its credibility
mr president i too consider this to be a satisfactory significant report
i would however stress certain points
i refer to the mediterranean policy and the middle east peace process which are also priorities
we must be consistent as i will remind the council when we come to discuss the budgetary issues
finally i would like to mention two other points the former yugoslavia and crime
the sooner we do this the better
apart from anything else the embargo is affecting other countries in the region including several candidate countries
it is causing serious harm
and who can lift it if europe does not
it appears that even the united states are expecting us to lift the embargo
we must find the courage to take this step
lastly as other members have reminded us we must deal with society as well as infrastructures
society is important and that is why we must continue with information and culture projects
then there is the issue of crime
my country italy has a very high organised crime rate
puglia for example is a region which has to tackle crime organisations with a base in our country as well as elsewhere
yet there was a great deal of similarity
it is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the balkans
they want to be integrated with the euroatlantic structures they want that as an alternative to the traumatic disintegration of the last few years
we have to make that a real process for them
the offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference
there are a couple of points i want to make about it
there is a simple reason for that which is that in some cases we had already carried out feasibility studies and made preparations for these quickstart projects
in my book new money is money you have not spent already
committing money does not always mean spending it the next year or the year after or even in the next decade
it is important to be clear about that
this follows up the point made by mr swoboda and it is a point with which i strongly agree
we are not just talking about infrastructure in terms of hardware we must also talk about infrastructure in terms of software
i want to make one or two other points which arose at lisbon and which we are following up
for agricultural products the figure is about 
so this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous
we are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective
i announced yesterday agreement in the commission on a rapid reaction facility
but that happened in some of those cities last winter
the winter is over so there is not the same urgent necessity for oil at the moment
we are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme
i hope we are at last going to see more progress on the cleaning up of the danube which is crucial for the region
i have spoken before of my concerns about montenegro
finally the honourable member asked about the scale of our financial commitments to the balkans
there will be other occasions when i can follow this up in greater detail
this year we will be spending about eur m in the western balkans
year one is actually the big year of expenditure for us
people say that is a crazy figure
that could only start once milosevic has gone
the rest  eur bn  over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous
who knows if i was lucky enough one day i might even be able to explain it to finance ministers
i respond to the honourable member s wellintentioned question in that way
so let us see the cost of it in the balkans
if we are going to have an argument about the relationship between rhetoric and reality let us start here
we are talking about building peace and security in an integral part of our european common home
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  am
question time council
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the council
as they deal with the same subject questions nos   and  will be taken together
question no  by h
question no  by h
subject human rights violations by turkey in december  turkey became a candidate country for accession to the european union
question no  by h
it will continue to monitor this situation in turkey as it develops and to act accordingly
turkey was named by the helsinki european council as a candidate country for accession to the european union
these are a prerequisite for the opening of any negotiating process
on the road towards this a preaccession strategy must be established between the commission on the eu s behalf and turkey
the preparation of this strategy involves nongovernmental organisations the member states and the turkish government
clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered
yet both yesterday and today they underlined the supposed progress made by the turkish regime in that area
and we heard the representative of the council telling us the same thing today
they also told us that turkey intends to take steps
if anything things are worse
but no more
the internal situation is now becoming a strategic element in the progress made by turkey towards approximation with the european union
for a long time we have adopted a foreign policy which we allege is based on moral rules and not just that
we have come to believe it ourselves and we claim to represent the worldwide moral conscience
already however we have reached an impasse and not just in turkey
you see morality must be applied towards everyone equally regardless of risks and interests
but that cannot happen
you see belgrade can be bombed but not moscow beijing or ankara
let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions
in other words let us speak of interests the balance of powers and policy as the art of the possible
i am not sure that you have asked a question
mr theonas wishes to rephrase his question
i recommend to all of you that you begin with the question before making a declaration
that was my comment
in fact quite the contrary is true
it is this point which really must be borne in mind
if there were a lack of progress on the fundamental issues under observation the preaccession process would suffer the respective consequences
this is very clear to me
a comment and question to the council s representative is the answer he just gave us specific
for goodness sake
mr korakas i must make a confession in political life people are used to reading between the lines
i cannot make this any clearer
question no  by h
these are clearly administrative issues
they do have a human rights dimension which obviously must be tackled  and we will be vigilant in this respect  but they are essentially administrative
the council will be vigilant and the commission will also raise these issues during the preaccession negotiations
mr presidentinoffice i cannot say your answer is satisfactory
if the council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer
i would like to ask whether you can be more specific
is the council going to take any specific action along those lines
mr alyssandrakis says that my answer was not positive enough
it would be useful to remind him of his question
i have no idea what more positive answer i could give him than to simply say yes
question no  by h
will the council say what measures it intends to take to safeguard a multiethnic kosovo as part of the yugoslav federation
what action will it take to defuse the crisis and tension in the region
several member states have also reinforced their own contingents in kfor
we are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in kosovo
only responsibilitysharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multiethnic kosovo
in this context the council repeats its appeal to the serbian leaders to participate in the joint interim administrative structures
the aid for reconstruction and the special financial assistance including the support for unmik will total eur  million between  and 
this set of actions and the commitment shown by the eu in this respect have been recognised by the international community
let me first comment that the presidentinoffice of the council is besieged by questions from greek members
i want to thank him for his answer
i am not ignoring the major difficulties present on the ground in applying these decisions
there is no point on this issue using euphemisms or diplomatic language
we must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this
we cannot ignore the fact that this joint effort also needs the serbian authorities to be involved in the consultative structures
this would be one way of making its own actions in kosovo credible
our only objective is to guarantee the continuation of multiethnic integration
there is no point beating about the bush on this this situation is unfair
however we must realise that the international community is doing its best
mr alavanos said that until now all the questions we have heard have been greek
i would like to say that the spanish and the portuguese as well as other mediterranean people are accustomed to speaking with the greeks
i believe that lisbon the ancient olisipo was founded by ulysses
the presidentinoffice of the council therefore comes from a country with a long tradition of greek presence
what is being done to get the kla and the albanian bullyboys who clearly have no interest in a multiethnic kosovo under control
there just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful pious good intentions
it was precisely the situation created in the former yugoslavia which caused this reaction
you refer to the kla
as a specific example of what military forces can do i would refer you to the case of bosniaherzegovina just think what the situation was like there for several years
in fact quite the contrary
you say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted
we have made and are making efforts to achieve greater integration of the minority communities
a more effective result has not been possible
question no  by h
furthermore the proper management of the fourth pillar entails a number of additional obligations for the eu institutions
 pt security council resolution  gave unmik the interim administration in kosovo authority over the territory including full legislative and executive powers and control over the legal system
this mandate also includes the development of a phased economic recovery plan
i have been waiting about six months for an answer on this
there is a whole raft of questions and answers and we are becoming schizophrenic over the substance and content of the answers
what is hiding behind all that
if mr kouchner is not doing his job properly what are you going to do about it
that does not happen anywhere it is unreasonable
the question raised has never been submitted to the council of the european union particularly by the undertakings which are complaining
the council presidency has no knowledge of this issue
it should be borne in mind that the administration in kosovo does not come under the eu s competence but under that of the un
there is a specific body responsible for this administration
each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere
the european union is not a country
that is unless we reach a point at which national governments prove to be incompetent in protecting their own undertakings
many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity
it is clear that the cost of recruiting staff is high
the union as such does not therefore have a specific and direct response to this type of question
mr president my question is quite specific and is i believe of direct concern to the eu
question no  by h
coordination at european level would be conducive to the further development of the it sector
this too involves the principle of subsidiarity
i want to thank the council for its answer
what happens in the future is important
we do of course have shortcomings within the eu
moreover there are major differences between the eu s member states and also between different regions within the eu
is there not a need for a joint authority to coordinate this work
this is the answer to your first question
you rightly make the point that on many occasions specifying these measures may create and worsen inequalities
this is a danger and risk to which we are alert
they in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose
i would be interested to know how the presidentinoffice of the council views the sale by auction of umts licences
what do you think to the idea of developing incentivisation programmes for the member states so as to enable the proceeds to actually be ploughed back into this sector
this was one of the objective concerns raised during discussions of this issue in lisbon
question no  by h
how many women will there be in the crisis management bodies and the security and conflictprevention political committee
will the council be taking due account of the specific contribution women can make to working for peace
the member has asked whether the council will be taking due account of women s particular skills in working for peace
it should be realised that proactive policies do not work in some areas of the decisionmaking process
in our opinion this is not appropriate and the council has made no proposal in this respect
nevertheless i consider his reply to be basically too retrograde
you have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references
i would like to ask the portuguese presidency do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference in the form of a recommendation in this respect
the european union must be progressive
i have no hesitation in saying this because in my own departments  of the officials are women even in managerial posts
mrs izquierdo rojo i cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct i must always be objectively honest
question no  by h
the eu s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries
in  the european parliament and the council adopted the fifth framework programme for research and technological development to run from then until 
the application of these three decisions is clearly the commission s responsibility supported by the committees for the relevant programmes
mr presidentinoffice i thank you for this reply
i would however like a brief answer that is clearer and more precise
do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds
they were not able to before
how is the situation different from for example that regarding the intas and interreg programmes in eastern europe
question no  by h
it is generally supposed that portugal plans to expand the list at the june meeting
is this true and will portugal then bring the common defence policy onto the agenda for the igc
these structures were established on this date
it is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the european union whether or not amendments to the treaty will be necessary
as soon as this becomes clear we will announce this
if these are to be included this would only be confirmed during the french presidency
there are member states in nato and there are countries which are not in nato
the issue in question is not therefore a european defence policy or the creation of a european army
all the eu countries including yours can make a valuable contribution to this area
in this respect i can see no major problems
we hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the union are compatible
i would thank the council
i am nonetheless a little surprised at the answer
in that way article  of the treaty of amsterdam would really of course be revoked that is to say if action were to be taken on the basis of national legal systems
it is clear that at a much wider level and bearing in mind the dimension of the operations these actions will also require the involvement of the united states of america and canada
question no  by h
it is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values
the union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the member states
therefore the council cannot interfere in the decisionmaking of the authorities
having exhausted this recourse to the greek courts there would always be recourse to the court of human rights
the decision provides an opportunity for the applicant states too to participate in the military structures to be established by the eu
does this also apply to turkey which has of course applied for membership
mr sjostedt the member states undertake to act within the framework determined by the treaty
this is why they signed the treaty
the union itself has ways of doing this but only in specific cases
thank you very much mr seixas da costa
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the council
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
address by mr klestil president of the republic of austria
mr president you expressed the wish to speak today at our parliament s formal sitting
loud applause it is in that spirit that i now welcome you on behalf of the european parliament
as president klestil prepared to take the floor many leftwing members left the chamber
interjection from mrs muscardini so that is democracy not to give a hearing to speakers 
financial services and complementary pensions
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
i therefore also ask members to show an appropriate degree of selfdiscipline so that we can finish at a reasonable time
what is included in these measures
what is intended through these measures
in the explanatory statement i offer a detailed comparison of the two types of market
thirdly granting the commission broad powers of interpretation
therefore one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives
we could not agree more
the consequence is that in order for the market to function these barriers must be removed
firstly the barriers are not identified
commissioner it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the commission
secondly the solution proposed by the commission still raises difficulties
liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation
with regard to the legal framework i believe that there is a paradox in this sector
the more liberalised an economy is the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets
comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other
in this respect i am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur
existing legislation however prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique
the world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions
i would appreciate a reply to this
indeed making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible
mr president we see the reality of the situation all around us
this is the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs
with regard to prudential regulation this should not be disproportionate so that the security of the fund is guaranteed
that covers the general framework
i now come to the report by mr garciamargallo y marfil
the communication from the commission is liberalminded and forwardlooking
why should parliament now adopt a less liberal position and vote in favour of stagnating structures
it is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way
the question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature
both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits
but it should be determined individually by each employee as the commission proposes
leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity
increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in europe
i am committed to the idea that we as the european parliament should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual
this must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services
mr president the socialists support the commission s efforts to establish a transparent and fluid internal financial services market
the action plan aims to make the european market equal to the american market
the success of the american market is basically due to king dollar 
the problem is that the legislative bodies both national and european are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality
personally i would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for nonaccountable technocrats
john kenneth galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence
the lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria which often leads to financial crisis
up until now it has mostly been a matter of words and all too few concrete measures
these are detrimental not only to companies but also of course to europe s citizens
the development of the internet is and will be of great importance to the provision of financial services across national borders
the commission s green paper on liberalising complementary forms of pension protection is something we welcome
this is an issue which can be resolved better at national level
in committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks
views were put forward to the effect that only those systems which cover risks of this kind are to be included under the directive
freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing
the commission s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market
how matters will turn out however we do not know
supplementary assurances are therefore a problem
they are of course much less secure than a system of basic pensions which has been financed on the basis of solidarity
even if these too are marketbased they offer much more in terms of stability and security than the privatised pension assurances
we politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good sound system of basic pensions
it is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote
unfortunately the commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish
we have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between member states will be a reality
the first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules
it is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies
a pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable
a fullvalue pension scheme covers biometric risks
insurance companies do offer their participants a choice and their products do not cover biometric risks
since the risks covered are not identical government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies
on account of this supervision complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases
this leads on average to higher returns
the second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the member states
taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions
i hope that parliament and the commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines
we are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans
on the other hand we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions
nevertheless we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes which cover biometric risks
we must take account of the great difficulties which exist within the union with regard to the development of supplementary systems
the dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course
the capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro
moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance which would gradually replace social security
welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market
the set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets
it has been radically changed however by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation
i cannot therefore approve this report which makes the commission s approach even worse
on the contrary we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained based on solidarity regardless of financial profitability
employers contributions should be linked to companies employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant
there are of course many risks with equity investments but there are even greater risks to europe with stagnant economies
the state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age
but personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully
that is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies
mr president this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in europe
in fact it seeks nothing less than to open up all european pension schemes to the financial markets
this report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes
the truth is that it is not an attempt to supplement state pension schemes but rather to gradually empty them of all substance
those who are employed know full well however that a pension is theirs by right
they fought for this right which is based on intergenerational solidarity
that is why they do not under any circumstances want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange
in several countries powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts
their threats have to this day prevented the french government for example from introducing pension funds
retired people need an adequate stable and safe pension
pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that
i think he deserves tribute for this
i myself come from a country where a very extensive second pillar of supplementary pensions exists
almost  of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wagerelated pension
this also includes small and mediumsized businesses
pension funds in the netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments
in  nearly half of the pension money was invested in shares albeit under strict prudential conditions
but the average return over the past five years has been around  instead of the usual 
it has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results
the fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level
consequently i would strongly discourage you from formulating a principle of free choice at european level
if i were you i would leave this to the member states and the free market
as for biometric risks other speakers have already talked enough about this
mr president we are voting against this report advocating selffunded pension schemes
at the same time it makes the value of pensions subordinate to the financial markets in other words to speculation
referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle
unfortunately we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of member states
to this end we need to develop a legal framework at european level at the earliest opportunity
as such this german person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility
what is more the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line
commissioner you deal with taxes what is the latest on this score
this unfortunately is at the expense of member states which already have their house in order
but the dutch system is a worthy system which accepts old age surviving dependants and vulnerable groups within the labour market as they are
the supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity
mr bolkestein how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter namely mobile pensions for mobile people
the key word is supplementary pensions
we are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement
the second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around europe
the key is to keep it simple or it will not work it will not remove the obstacles
once you start building on top of that you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport
what we need is to have a very simple proposition and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for
the biometric risks problem means many different things to different people
so the key is to keep it simple and make it work
and what is the truth the governments have squandered the funds and made off with the workers salaries
shame on the socialist governments for failing to provide for workers in their old age
it is time to change the tune we must give to caesar what is caesar s and to god what is god s
mr president we are facing a difficult issue as evidenced by the large number of speakers
i would like to extend warm thanks to mr kuckelkorn as rapporteur for the huge effort he has made to achieve this report
i think that we should differentiate between the two kuckelkorns
i believe that the systems we should pursue in europe should be based on two principles
it is true that a country such as the netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two
in england if there is a hard frost for example people are unable to pay their bills
i do not think that this is the right way forward
we should keep intervention to a minimum
the commission has always attempted to do this and i do believe that it has succeeded in its aim
i think that two issues still need tackling
firstly risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered because far too little has been said about this
and if we could bring all of this a bit closer together we would perhaps have far fewer problems than we have at the moment
perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect i hope at the same time to comment on the amendments which have been tabled
the commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect
we also have a few specific proposals in this respect
firstly we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens
thirdly we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules
the fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce or ecommerce for short
policy and legislation should make provision for ecommerce without creating unnecessary barriers
finally an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions
does this mean that the european central bank in frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role
the ecb itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary
there is in fact an alternative to wit a coming together of supervisory systems
at this juncture mr president i would like to bring up a remark made by mrs randzioplath
it is an important remark
mrs randzioplath has picked up some noises from the oecd and mentioned the word megarisk
indeed i think she is right to indicate the risks which can be inherent in financial movements
this is a very important matter
the report will be made available shortly
no doubt you will be able to find it on the internet
but how exactly can this be done
i myself have been a member of parliament for a long time so i fully understand where mr garciamargallo y marfil is coming from
nonetheless we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules
i would invite the members of this parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process
should we make more use of comitology procedures
should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading
in its communication on pensions the commission has included proposals on three fronts
there is no question that rules could be introduced which could threaten the rights of future pensioners
this is beyond dispute
secondly the coordination of national tax systems is a condition for crossborder participation
mrs peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people
so it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs
this coordination is a precondition for crossborder labour mobility
the commission s third objective is to remove the obstacles which migrant workers are faced with
the desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by mr blokland among others
mr blokland pointed this out and i share his view on this
this is also echoed in the motion for a resolution
these standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions
but there is not one single technical reason why these different types of savings schemes could not be combined in one and the same directive
i believe that this is not right
this freedom remains
adequate supervision is crucial as is liberalising the scope of pension funds
mr president i would like to ask the commissioner if he could also reply to my question
i have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now
mr president i would prefer to address mrs plooijvan gorsel s issue when i respond to the report on the internal market
this would however mean that mrs plooijvan gorsel would have to stay even longer at this meeting
this is not such a bad thing in my opinion
it is true that small and mediumsized businesses are facing obstacles in their crossborder activities
the commission is acutely aware of this
needless to say the scope of the internal market is intended to facilitate crossborder activities for small and mediumsized businesses
the new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures many of which will be beneficial to small and mediumsized businesses
thank you very much commissioner
the joint debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
strategy for europe s internal market
allow me to make two observations the committee on legal affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion
that has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this house
what was that message
that message stems from the position adopted by the committee on legal affairs in our resolution of  november 
if you will allow me mr president i will concentrate on three ideas
what does the internal market mean to european construction
these days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international
the internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy
nothing could be further from the truth
this document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly
the internal market is europe s platform in the world
the internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for europe in terms of competition
that is the first message of the committee on legal affairs
these must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built
we will not make the headlines with this but it is important nonetheless
the application and control of community legislation is also important the member states must cooperate in this application
we must oppose procedures which are used too frequently such as gold plating 
we need to strengthen our infringement procedure we need to consolidate it make it more transparent and more accessible
we ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that parliament be informed of them
we ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen
lastly the third message is a change in the business culture in europe
we need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks
we need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market
in all of this electronic commerce the internet and new technologies must offer a good platform
a proportion of its content affects the competences of the committee on economic and monetary affairs
it is these points which i wish to discuss specifically
the european parliament s resolution of  november  said that the document was rather unspecific that it did not contain specific actions
this new version does contain specific measures and proposals
let us then analyse the content of these proposals albeit in general terms
we are starting with a european social model  which is a national model  and we are transforming the economic structure of that society
in doing so we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current european social model
an example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport
we have had examples such as the case of venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country
liberalisation presents other difficulties
another aspect  which we referred to in the recent debate on the kuckelkorn report  is the need to coordinate social protection
social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity
lastly cohesion also seems to me to be important
the lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy
at the same time it lays down restrictions on exercising fishing activities in certain areas known as boxes 
mr president on behalf of our group i should like to warmly welcome mrs palacio vallelersundi s excellent report
i want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes
the first one is the need to address within the union the impact of legislation on business
it needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process
he must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward
we were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at lisbon
i am disappointed to see that our socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution
i can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow
i invite colleagues to reject that proposal
i conclude by confirming that the committee on legal affairs and the internal market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market
i hope that is appreciated
i hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed
i hope that together we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible
i would like to highlight some of these points
in order to keep pace with the present breakneck speed at which technology is developing it is not only desirable but essential to keep the dialogue going
this is why information campaigns are essential after all europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle
back to basics should be our motto
the eeurope initiative praises the use and expertise of internet and multimedia
in order to meet these objectives the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house or rather their home
finally i can only echo the need for slim
legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language
superfluous legislation should be withdrawn
it would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished
mr president i would like to speak on a point of order
if i am not mistaken mr harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment
i believe that there has been a little confusion
in the spanish version which i have there is no problem
the amendment is based on the german text which causes some concern because it refers to the issue of share options
i imagine that in the english text which mr harbour has there is no problem either
the commission feels confirmed in its intention thanks to this important vote of confidence coming from this parliament
mrs palacio vallelersundi has mentioned three topics
mrs palacio vallelersundi s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies
according to her sometimes one does not know where one stands
this would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent
if this were the case then the commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation
mrs palacio vallelersundi s third remark concerns the change in culture
i happen to disagree with these critics
responsibility lies with both camps
i hence agree with mrs palacio vallelersundi that something needs to be done to breathe new life into europe s entrepreneurial culture
after having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur mrs palacio vallelersundi i would now like to move on to remarks made by mr berenguer fuster
according to him the commission should have more political courage especially in the fiscal domain
my response to mr berenguer fuster is should the commission have yet more political courage
what the commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve
it also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor mr monti
i would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world
this would not be the right attitude in my opinion
although mr berenguer fuster has not said this in so many words of course i would still like to take the opportunity to stress this point
i ask mr berenguer fuster if he would like the commission to have yet more political courage
we are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed
i would like to see the commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there
mr berenguer fuster has also said that a great deal still needs to be done in the field of financial services
and he is right of course
mr berenguer fuster is undoubtedly familiar with the action plan for financial services which was adopted on  may  and which includes  objectives
we are in the process of achieving these at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year
i would now like to comment on a remark made by mr medina ortega
he said that at present there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies
i would like to assure mr medina ortega that this is of course by no means the intention
replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse
this is certainly not the intention of this commission
but i repeat the prospect of replacing state monopolies by private monopolies is something which we do not exactly relish
the commission is aware that for example the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the united states
in europe it takes far longer even as long as five months a ratio of  in 
this is of course directly reflected in the cost
i have quoted what mrs berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off
this could not be further from the truth
the internal market is far from complete
mrs berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the council
let us hope that this will change
we are all waiting for this moment
mr president this concludes my remarks
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
 european year of languages
on behalf of the group i can recommend supporting this programme
mr president needless to say i too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and exquisite work
i would like to make a few minor observations regarding a european campaign which intends to teach europeans languages from other communities
we are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise of course
this is a terrible observation to have to make
i would also add our own mother tongue to the equation
i repeat   english words derive from classical greek
there are a similar number of words in the french language that derive from greek and the same is true of most other modern european languages
it is also certain that latin is just as important for most european languages
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to thank the rapporteur
the european year of languages is important and worthwhile
all the languages of europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture
it could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality
the mother tongue is not merely a tool of communication it is in fact more than anything else it is thought itself
language is the most peaceful way of communicating
independence is language and language is independence
the kurds are a nation with no land or borders of their own kept together only by language
language is a powerful force
it is the most important bond for a nation
large countries and many smaller ones too often tyrannise others through language
it is a means of occupation
the legislation regarding language in my country is among the most liberal in the world
that is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages
the multilingual nature of the european union is thus a source of wealth
at the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each member state
the multilingual nature of europe must be preserved after enlargement too there are no obstacles to this
it is wrong to think that a multilingual environment is costly and ineffective
translation is not costly it is the most effective practical instrument of peace
however i would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions
i am referring for example to ladino and yiddish
these languages furthermore do not have any media of their own
what better rapporteur could there be
in terms of languages europe has known times when a single language predominated latin and also french
now it tends to be english
so what are we to tell our fellow citizens for this year 
let me just briefly mention a few points
firstly that european unity may not mean linguistic unity
next that every language is deserving of respect and deserves to be promoted and defended
this is applicable to any amount of things monuments objects you name it
and then all languages are learnt within the family first of all
it is up to us to construct this dialectic of european unity and its linguistic diversity
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
youth
mr president i am very pleased to add my support and my group s support to this report
this report had a long gestation period
we also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance
we will always ask for more money
the budget is not enough
it is perhaps parliament s role to ask for more
but we can be pleased with the outcome
we are delighted that some candidate countries of central and eastern europe will benefit as well
we can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report
mr president i should like to thank mrs groner for her splendid work and for the personal almost passionate commitment she has shown in preparing the present report
i should also like to thank the council and the commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result
the strength of the programme is of course that by means of crossnational exchanges it encourages young people to contribute actively to further european integration
it will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the european union
i also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the european union is founded will continue to be propagated
i would recommend that we support this programme
mr president i also commend the report and thank mrs groner for the excellent effort she has made
it is a very good report
youth is the sector in our community that is so often ignored
we hope that imbalance will be redressed
i hope that does not happen
we should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future
the new youth programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries
that is an excellent initiative
the bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite europe
the agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that i welcome
what more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the european union
i offer them my thanks for their work
i would like to reassure all members who have spoken about possible sanctions
the programme has ambitious objectives which are essential to the development of the idea of european citizenship
it therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of european integration
mr president i wish to take this opportunity to talk about the youth policy of the future
in fact i stood before you for the first time last september
i spoke of the white paper on the european union s youth policy which is a priority
this proposal was very warmly received by all the member states and these meetings are being organised at the moment
the various national meetings will culminate in a huge european meeting which will be held at the beginning of october under the french presidency
at the same time as consulting young people the commission hopes to consult those responsible for youth policy at national level
lastly i would like to include the european parliament in this exercise
ladies and gentlemen there is a considerable amount of work to be done but it is exciting
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
before the sitting is closed i would like to thank the interpreters for their generous cooperation this evening since we have exceeded the time allotted
the sitting was closed at  am
principles for recording taxes and social contributions
this is a serious issue which has been debated
both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year
i would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget
i therefore take a favourable view of the proposal and i congratulate the commission
ladies and gentlemen i would like to ask you and also the commission for your help
i would be grateful if you could please keep strictly to your speaking time as our timetable is very tight
we have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the european system of national and regional accounts esa 
the ppede group agrees with the commission proposal in this regard
two questions still remain however
the member states also need time to adjust to new rules
in order for the accounting methods of the different member states to be homogenous as the rapporteur has pointed out they must use the same criteria
as you know accounts which do not offer a true picture can be called anything but accounts
obviously this juggling of accounts will not be possible if the commission s proposal is approved
it is not a question of revising now what was done in the past
ladies and gentlemen what is done is done
ladies and gentlemen if rigour in accounting is demanded it should be so from the outset
mr president firstly i wish to thank mrs thyssen for her gesture and for her defence of the amendment we are presenting
this change is a complicated change
as any expert knows the estimations in accordance with esa  require breakdowns which affect no less than  accounting categories
secondly this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way
as mrs thyssen has pointed out changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time
we are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago
the ppede s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually
this is certainly a step forward
it seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit
overall this is a useful step forward
i welcome the commitment of the commission
i hope that we can work together and see this translated into community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible
however i firstly wish to thank especially the rapporteur mr knorr borras for his work which on this complex and technical issue has offered us great support
the committee on economic and monetary affairs has approved eight amendments and the commission can accept amendments nos     and  without any difficulty
there is a ninth amendment presented later which i will also comment on
the commission would prefer not to maintain amendments nos   and 
the aim of these amendments differs from that of the regulation
we hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised
we are therefore talking about a technical problem of not having the capacity to provide data
this is the reason why the commission does not consider amendment no  to be acceptable
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am
com in bananas
under constant attack since its adoption this regulation eventually led to several wto rulings against us the latest in april 
always quick on the draw the united states immediately drew up retaliatory trade measures against union countries
as we know this system has already been attacked by the majority of operators and producers from all geographic areas
the stakes are high
since  the position of the community producers has been constantly deteriorating
the same applies to many acp countries traditional suppliers
it is impossible for these producers to maintain fair competition with the great producers and operators in the international network
we should also remember that over  of the bananas consumed in the union come from nonacp third countries
it is not a question of practising protectionism but rather of protecting the permanence of a certain method of production
the margin of manoeuvre is technically narrow but the choice of a reform model is political
we need to know what our objectives are
as i see it the first priority is to defend the european model at the international level
that is certainly the position the members of the committee on agriculture and rural development unanimously adopted
why should it be any different for bananas
in any case accompanying measures are essential to ensure the permanence and viability of community and acp production
 draftsman of the opinion of the committee on industry external trade research and energy
in fact in the commission s current negotiations it appears that the main suppliers would prefer this system
for all these reasons my committee voted in favour of mr dary s draft report
so on this issue  i know  the commission s task is not an easy one
but the rapporteur s proposal is satisfactory because it defends the quota system and rejects any automatic move to an exclusively tariffbased regime
so i thank him and i also thank mr fernandez martin for putting the committee s point of view
of course the acp countries know they must adapt to world trade
but let us give them time
let us give them enough time let us give them the means to produce their plants themselves let us help them build their greenhouses
let us encourage organic farming and in ten years believe me the price of african bananas will have fallen to the level of dollar bananas
they will then become competitive
i take comfort in the fact that i am not the only one
the commission s proposal has not been well received by anyone neither by the community producers nor by the acp countries
it seems that the council cannot easily accept it parliament does not like it either
what is even more serious however is that not even the united states like it
the world trade organisation condemned the system of licences in force which must undoubtedly be modified
has the commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the com in bananas
after bananas will other sectors fall
when will we stop protecting austrian white wines for example
this clearly remains an open question within the wto
i congratulate the commission for striving to reach a compromise that has regard to the various interest groups
it is right that the european union should bear responsibility for seeing that european agricultural producers including banana producers earn a sufficient income
i would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of mr dary s report for trade policy
the union has lost the banana dispute in the wto four times already and it cannot afford to lose a fifth time for three reasons
thirdly continued breaches of the regulations will hurt our image internationally in matters of trade which might weaken the case for the european agricultural subsidy model
this meanwhile would have very serious consequences for the whole of european agriculture
mr president it is high time that we resolved this complex and longstanding issue once and for all
it will not be possible to satisfy fully all these claims and therefore we have to accept a compromise
i have also heard that during the vote which will take place either today or tomorrow some may advocate referral back to committee
we need stability for european and acp banana producers and eu consumers
that can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the commission s compromise proposal
the commission proposes a quota of   tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand
in any event we should safeguard the community preference and prevent any marginalisation of community production
i would therefore mr president like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to mr dary
we support his report
he has been generous with the amendments of the different political groups
furthermore i hope that the commission will send a clear political signal which will take account of his points of view
so they represent an essential element in the balance of the economic and social fabric of these fragile territories
are we willing to sacrifice production which means life or death to some of our territories for peace at the wto
we are giving the united states a marvellous present there
well it is not enough
the united states wants more
technically what does it want
but most of all and politically the united states actually wants the monopoly of the future eastern european market for their multinationals
what is europe doing to face that challenge
it is divided and getting bogged down
we are divided from our german friends
but we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals
we could undoubtedly challenge that and our excellent rapporteur mr dary does challenge it
he proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years
another four years mr american executioner
and we have tabled amendments too
well all that is very fine but the battle is elsewhere
the battle is for community preference first and foremost
we have to choose either the canaries madeira and the antilles  or chiquita
it is regional policy that is at stake
do we want the outermost regions which depend  on bananas like the canaries to survive or do we want dole and chiquita to accumulate more wealth
it is cooperation policy that is at stake
we have to choose either africa and the lome convention or the wto
the united states was found guilty of two billion dollars worth of fiscal fraud and it has changed nothing
when the united states alters its policy we will discuss the mere  million for bananas
when the united states stops cheating for the benefit of boeing kodak cargil and ford we will discuss bananas
in the meantime we need long global political negotiations
we must talk about iraq echelon serbia put everything on the table
sanction for sanction retaliation for retaliation
the banana is a moment of truth europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted
there is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends
does europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends
the eu has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate
this is an area where some member states are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others
mr president commissioner it falls to me to summarise the problems of the com in bananas in just a few minutes
the reason for that is simple
so we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the dary report i congratulate and thank mr dary
it is our duty to preserve everything the union stands for especially on the eve of its enlargement
mr president the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly
in fact so far the world trade organisation has only declared two extremes incompatible with international commercial law
the first is the partnership system which linked the importing of noncommunity bananas with that of community bananas
community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision
the second refers to the incompatibility of the exemption in favour of acp countries within the community system
for many of us bananas are a national issue since they are related to our history and our culture
we ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the wto was founded
this will protect the essential interests of the acp producer countries
the arrangements for eu banana producers are not as good as they might be
there is still a need for a political compromise here
the structural measures envisaged in title iii of the regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas need to be considerably strengthened
indeed we find the commission s new proposal unacceptable because it makes unacceptable concessions to the multinationals of latin america
is there anyone in this parliament unaware of the role played by these multinationals in financing american campaigns
therefore we cannot afford to be condemned like this again
that is not easy but the present system is untenable
we must therefore urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude
in view of the fact that the commission proposal in my modest opinion meets these requirements i shall support it
in  the wto panel orchestrated by the united states condemned the community s import licences system
the commission has submitted to that verdict by amending the market conditions to end up with a tariff only system in 
mr president i would like to start by putting some questions to the commission in the person of commissioner fischler
surely it is unacceptable to be applying two different sets of criteria
is the commission not guilty of double standards here
are bananas the poor relation of agricultural production in the european union
is there also a plan to liberalise trade in meat milk and cereals
mr president i believe that these commission proposals will mean that a number of african caribbean and pacific countries will go out of business
that will lead to poverty and even more deprivation
yes we have to simplify the system
it is far too complicated at the moment
but i believe those countries need time to diversify properly and that is why i would agree with a tenyear transitional period
chiquita dole and del monte who produce in latin american countries have not seen their production levels go down since 
their access to the market has not gone down since 
all they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the acp countries
yes we have to find a solution
producers in the uk are being held to ransom by the usa
we must not let acp countries go to the wall just to save companies in the eu
this is not just about bananas it is about trade with developing countries overall
i am quite aware of the inconsistencies in the common organisation of the market in bananas and associated relations with the wto
postponing this until  would not make much difference although that would undoubtedly give us more time to find less damaging solutions
we are all aware of the illiberal acts of these multinationals which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment
the challenge should be to reform the wto
the seattle summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain
this should be the european union s policy
mr president i speak from three perspectives
i regret various aspects of this dary report
i have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable
i regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way
that is essential
i support the commissioner s efforts
he has a difficult task
i have in mind above all amendments nos  and 
amendment no  calls for financial support for ecologically sound farming in third countries also
amendment no  calls for fair trade bananas to be supported regardless of their country of origin
by the way i think it is a shame that the greens are not taking part in this debate and also highlighting these aspects
in ecuador  of banana producers are small producers with less than  hectares and they are suffering from unjustifiable discrimination
that is why i believe that the commission will in any case have a mandate to negotiate including a mandate from parliament
that is the official position
nor does the commission s proposal comply with our international commitments
furthermore i am sure that you will find a viable route in the direction indicated
therefore commissioner act politically find a solution and listen to this parliament
this is not the time to fail to take account of this house
in fact these reflect our discussions with the wto complainants and the acp producers
i would like to give my reasons for this rejection area by area
i will make no bones about it the main objective of our proposal is to bring the com in bananas into line with wto rules
the most important part of the proposal is the introduction of the tariff system after a certain transitional period
the second important area is the issue of managing tariff quotas
the commission is attempting to negotiate with the principal suppliers about allocating tariff quotas on the basis of historical references
it would not be advisable to additionally define the individual options until these discussions have been concluded
that really would be demanding the impossible
the third area which relates to quotas is the extension of the period for maintaining the quota system to at least  years
as we explained in the explanatory memorandum the quickest way to do this is through the tariff system
a higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the wto
i shall now turn to the special support measures for our own producers in the european union
the final ruling does not affect our intracommunity support system
furthermore i would like to point out that this is a deficiency payment system which means that it has a builtin guarantee
if prices fall subsidies automatically increase
my last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas
measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes
as you know this communication is not just about fair trade bananas but about fair trade in general
the commission is grateful for the wideranging discussions that have taken place here today
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am
i shall suspend the sitting until the president arrives
the sitting was suspended at  am and resumed at  am
vote
madam president mr baron crespo chairman of the socialist group also directed a comment to me
almost every member of the committee spoke on this
i established the connection and i said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh
that is why i tabled this amendment
in other words mr baron crespo you will take over amendment no  on behalf of your group pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
is that correct
madam president on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party i shall support mr baron crespo s proposal
i did not think it was necessary to say this again explicitly but if you wish i will gladly do that
on amendment no 

after the vote on amendment no 
madam president although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken this creates a very dangerous precedent
parliament adopted the resolution
before the vote
i do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it
yes i am afraid that will delay our work a little mrs frahm
i will try to be as clear as possible in taking the votes
parliament adopted the two resolutions and three decisions in successive votes
parliament adopted the two decisions and the resolution in successive votes
before the vote
madam president there are two amendments tabled to mr kuhne s report which propose to postpone discharge for parliament
these amendments make reference to the secretarygeneral
mr van hulten as president i take responsibility for declaring these amendments admissible
i am not expressing an opinion on their content
parliament has not yet voted on them
the problem facing me is whether they are admissible or not
i am telling you that i sincerely and honestly believe after examining the position that these amendments are admissible
if they are voted through they will obviously be implemented like everything else we vote for
on amendment no 
if you think it is necessary i can read out the full wording of these observations although personally i would prefer not to
on amendment no  from the greensale group
madam president point  on which we have to vote in this amendment stipulates a deadline of  may
if we were to accept this we would be contradicting a paragraph that we agreed earlier
madam president we will not of course withdraw this point because it is at the heart of our amendment
we do not want a list of measures that can come later
there is nothing contradictory at all about this
parliament adopted the decision
parliament adopted the decision and the resolution in successive votes
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
on compromise amendment no 
our group supports this compromise amendment with however the exception of one word plus  plus proportionnelle
presumably the english version is more proportional
we cannot accept that word
however under the rules it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment
thank you mr corbett
but i have to apply the rules
a compromise amendment has been put before me
mr brok could you respond to mr corbett s remarks and say whether you agree to change the compromise amendment
madam president we would like to keep the compromise amendment
i put the question to parliament
are there any objections to our putting this compromise amendment to the vote
i thought that was the case
madam president i think it is fair that it be put to the vote
madam president this amendment has been tabled under the rules of procedure and it should be voted on accordingly
if it is rejected we can then switch to the rules suggested by mr corbett
that is the simplest approach
let us have a vote on the amendment and if it is rejected we can proceed as mr corbett has suggested
excuse me mr brok rule  of the rules of procedure is very clear
i am only following the rules just as i should
parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote
on amendment no  from the greensale group
madam president there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of amendment no 
we established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the french version
madam president the french text takes precedence
right thank you for making that clear
on compromise amendment no 
madam president your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment
on amendment no  from the ppe group
madam president we wish to request a split vote first on the term fourfifths and then on the rest
actually a split vote on the original text is scheduled that is if the amendment is rejected
are you withdrawing this amendment in which case we will hold a split vote on paragraph 
is that right mr brok
madam president if we were to do that here we would not need to present the oral amendment on paragraph 
so it would be easier to do that here
is that right
madam president i have the highest regard for elmar brok but in this case he is mistaken
the only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word continuing in english or anhaltend in german to serious  which is schwerwiegend in the german version
that is the old text
we have not agreed on the fourfifths majority so it is just too late for this now
we cannot split this again now
if the amendments are withdrawn i will take the vote on the original text
now on the original text of paragraph  i believe i had a request for an oral amendment from one of our rapporteurs
mr dimitrakopoulos if you would like to present your oral amendment parliament will decide
madam president the oral amendment consists of adding the word continuing to the second part
that is clear
are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote
madam president this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected
it is not really in order with our normal procedure
are there twelve members against putting this oral amendment to the vote
more than twelve members rose to oppose the vote on the oral amendment
madam president i must refute what mr brok said
i proposed a solution in both cases
in this case we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment
thus it should never have been tabled in our name
it may have been a compromise between the eldr and the epp groups but it was not a compromise which we signed
before the final vote
parliament adopted the resolution
president
i warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen
loud applause
by way of explanation consider the following quotes
one might conclude that the commission had decided in some fields to draw a veil over and forget past events
by any standards these comments are excessive unfair and in the context of the discharge procedure wholly unsuitable
on the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today to vote in favour to vote against or to abstain
we chose to abstain and this requires explanation
we think not
we are against such an approach
so we have chosen to abstain
this is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one
our group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the european commission
unfortunately today s choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain
by that vote members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement
the resolution put to the vote in parliament today presents a catalogue of reasonable demands and recommendations to the commission
the postponement and the response time given to the commission allow it to answer the questions from the committee on budgetary control within the set time
they leave the committee on budgetary control sufficient time to prepare a report which will rule effectively on the implementation of the  budget by the commission
we cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes and for this reason we voted against the report
kuhne report a
the european parliament must operate the same high standards with regard to its own management as are required of the commission
dimitrakopoulosleinen report a
that is clear
we have put a large number of suggestions on the table
clearly not all of them will be taken up in the form which this parliament has advocated
but we know that
my group as you know and as baron crespo has just said has some reservations on particular points
we must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this house
i am confident that we can do that
we were very near to a compromise agreement
we should be able to crack this one
we are happy to vote for the report given the circumstances and with the reservations i have just described
mr president i have voted against this report
i say this with regret
i have voted against this report for almost the same reasons that mr corbett has voted in favour
i have the same objectives an ambitious intergovernmental conference which deals with the real issues and looks to the long term
i believe that this parliament is sending a confused message to the intergovernmental conference through this resolution
for all these reasons i regret once again to say that i have voted against
we find three points in this report particularly harmful
the necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies
the europe of nations group proposes putting an end to these conflicts by breaking through the ceiling of  members
why not a european parliament of  members
it could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination
mr president i shall endeavour to explain myself clearly
i voted against this report and i was not alone in doing so
we did so with conviction on behalf of the european regionalists of the ale
this agenda is of course too restricted
we regret that all amendments that serve to incorporate this dimension into europe have been rejected
we therefore hope that the igc will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way
we had to vote against because we do not fully identify ourselves with the structure of this democratic europe
it is the big states which are obtaining more power those and the central institutions
there is no trace of decentralisation and the redistribution of power and no sign of any substance being given to the subsidiarity principle
secondly no adjustments are being made in anticipation of enlargement which is perhaps the most serious feature of all
if a union of  member states is to be successful it must obviously have a flexible structure
there is nothing of this however
thirdly this is no democratic constitutional process but a case of a power game behind locked doors
i have therefore voted against
one was an amendment on the arms industries and arms exports and the other was on nuclear weapons
this is not in the interest of the ordinary people of europe
i want a demilitarised europe a democratic europe where the people have the real say not bureaucrats
this is why i voted for this amendment
mr president i voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although i did not agree with the individual points
we should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future
and i am quite sure the igc will not retain the current wording of paragraph 
mr president i voted for the dimitrakopoulos report although i do have some reservations about it
i am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process
mr president i abstained in the final vote for several major reasons and also some minor ones
it was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best
is that really a very sensible position for a parliament to take
ainardi bakopoulos eriksson figueiredo frahm koulourianos meijer herman schmid seppanen and sjostedt guengl in writing
instead of transforming the eu into a state we are of the opinion that the union must be democratised
we further protest against the report s advocacy of the militarisation of the eu
we insist that the eu remain a civil organisation and that the nonaligned countries special status be respected
we reiterate our condemnation of the failure to submit the emu project to referendum in all of the member states
however we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the igc should concentrate on
we are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting although we do not consider that it should be the rule
it is especially important that this matter be discussed on an ongoing basis with europe s citizens
all member states must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work
it is this will and the desire for common solutions which the eu must also build on in future
in parallel with the igc the member states are discussing a common european security and defence policy
we continue to believe that the eu should not be an actual defence alliance
in this area the eu must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management
also in parallel with the igc the creation of a charter of fundamental rights is being debated
the commitment of the portuguese members of the socialist group to the european project is a constant point of reference in its work and in its founding principles
the european project is a gradual process which has been able to adapt to changing realities and to respond to the vicissitudes of history
we consider that this new rule does not guarantee the necessary balance and equality in the representation of the member states in the council
the issue of electing  of the members of the european parliament via european lists is also insufficiently clear
the european list is a good idea especially if the only people included in it are individuals who represent a genuine point of reference in the spirit of europe
nevertheless it is our view that this concept should be considered in greater depth so that the fears that we have legitimately expressed here can be set aside
we are also unable to accept the rule on qualified majority voting for decisions concerning appointments
for procedural reasons we have made this statement immediately but some of the points remain dependent on a more detailed knowledge of the changes that have been made
 sv enlargement of the european union is one of the most important issues for the future of europe
the aim of the present intergovernmental conference is to prepare the eu for this enlargement
if enlargement is to be implemented successfully certain institutional changes are required
the report on the intergovernmental conference is the european parliament s contribution to that conference
the role of the european parliament is to represent the people in the union
enlargement means more states representatives in parliament
if an efficient decisionmaking procedure is to be maintained there must be a change in the way the seats are distributed
we advocate a ceiling of  members of the european parliament
the number of seats allocated to each country is determined through a system of degressive proportionality on the basis of the country s population
a new weighting of votes in the council is a prerequisite for successful enlargement of the eu
it is important that the solution should be a permanent one and not need to be changed in connection with any future enlargement
it ought to strike a balance between the principles of on the one hand one country one vote and on the other hand one citizen one vote 
an alternative would be for the weighting of votes in the council to be calculated on the basis of the root of the population in the individual countries
we believe that each member state should have a member in the commission
the commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the union
in that way the legitimacy of the commission would also be strengthened
it is nonetheless important and desirable that there should be european prosecutors in each member state and that they should cooperate
closer cooperation between at least a third of the member states cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation
eu cooperation is in the first place a civilian european project and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation
the member states have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned
it is therefore important that the treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation
military aid of a kind which places countries under obligations to each other has no place in the eu s treaty
we are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation
 the agenda of the igc has now been set by the member states
why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny
why is the weighting of votes in the council being changed for the benefit of the large countries at the expense of smaller countries
european union policy detaches the most developed regions from any sense of solidarity accelerating the break up of multinational federations
it imposes forced privatisation
that is why we have voted against this report
unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions
through these excesses a majority of this parliament has done europe a disservice
 in writing
a union of  to  member states cannot operate in the same way as a union of  member states
this is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that in this way the voting clearly reflects the will of the people
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party supports the commission s proposal but would emphasise that small countries should not be placed at a disadvantage
parliament ought to have  seats distributed among the population on the basis of a degressive proportional scale
we do not think it is appropriate to see this as a permanent solution to the problem which will arise when the eu is enlarged
the risk entailed in a europe a la carte is that the whole integrity and basic idea of eu cooperation will be lost
the wording in the treaty of amsterdam about closer cooperation is therefore an adequate and acceptable solution
too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise
 while not able to endorse every dot and comma of this report i support its broad thrust
if we are to make a success of enlargement a number of key reforms are essential
a union unable to make decisions would not serve the purpose of existing or applicant states
therefore
we must increase the use of qualified majority voting in the council in order to avoid paralysis in decision taking
we must limit the number of commissioners so that the union s executive remains efficient
and we must limit the number of meps to  to enable parliament to function effectively
 pt once again the european parliament finds itself compelled to adopt a maximalist position on the institutions a position bereft of any realism
as usual it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach
these are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so
however this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas
we are of course opposed to such ideas
the european parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies
but if it opts for the proposals contained in the dimitrakopoulosleinen report this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent
we will therefore be voting against the report
 the complexity of the igc process inevitably requires a complex response from the european parliament
eplp members voted in accordance with this approach reflecting our concerns over the following areas
 there ought to be one commissioner per member state paragraph 
this is about the commission s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support
this is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each member state
 there ought not to be any paneuropean lists or single european constituency paragraph 
 the financing of the eu should not be completely independent of contributions by the member states paragraph 
however i would express my satisfaction at the fact that so much attention has been devoted to the way in which the ec court of justice operates
the intergovernmental conference must now give consideration to parliament s constructive proposals
i am extremely surprised at the proposals which would give members of the european parliament the right to participate in the appointment of the judges
because the report is farreaching in its scope and because there is considerable disagreement about it parliament s point of view will be of little significance
that concludes the vote
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
i do not remember mr berlusconi being present
mr president with reference to mr frassoni s intervention we sent a letter to president fontaine this morning
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
iraq
mr president it is very important to point out that sanctions are themselves a form of warfare
they are targeted at the most innocent civilians at the innocent people in societies especially children the most vulnerable
the sanctions on iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there
over  children die there every single day
this is not acceptable
we cannot allow this to go on
mary robinson the high commissioner for human rights has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time
these resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings
it is not just here in europe that people are concerned but right across the world
if anyone looked at the very good documentary by the worldfamous journalist john pilger they would see what is happening there
can we allow this to go on without saying something about it
it is a blatant violation of international human rights laws
it is the ordinary people who suffer
we cannot allow this to go on
we also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any un mandate
that is absolutely unacceptable
a whole family was wiped out by these bombings as shown in mr pilger s documentary
this is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy
no member of this house can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many iraqi people find themselves
the facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as unicef
we have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity
but let there be no illusion as to the role of the iraqi regime in the suffering of its people
we in parliament are wellintentioned towards the people of iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution
we must concentrate our efforts on convincing iraq to implement the united nations resolutions
the european parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way
any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the iraqi regime
it is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the united nations lifted
i too have met some of these people
i have shared their suffering with them
let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself
we are caught between a rock and a hard place
it is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal political motives
civilians men women and children are dying because of the sanctions
i will not repeat the figures for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this chamber
but what a contradiction what a tragedy
in the name of the protection of human rights the rich powerful countries of the west are killing communities and starving them to death
during the war in yugoslavia american aircraft continuously bombarded towns killing civilians
it is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the united states take precedence over those of communities
today we are going to vote on a motion a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions an end to the embargo
i feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution
and that is essential
however i also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the middle east
we must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat
today i would also like to pay tribute to dennis halliday  mentioned by ms mckenna as well  who was responsible for the oilforfood deal
i hope that when the embargo imposed on iraq is lifted this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world
this is important for all of us
people think the war the missiles and the gassings are over but the filthy effects of this war which was never clean go on
there is still bombing in the north and in the south
cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture date palms are being burned daily
it is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food milk meat and fruit their minds are under attack as well
there are no books
even pencils are banned on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations
there are schools but there is no paper
there are doctors but there is no medicine
there are hospitals but there is nothing inside them
it is perverse
they were promised food in exchange for oil
but they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food
ladies and gentlemen  especially members who are not here  by what right is this happening
do not keep silent
do not be accomplices
un officials are resigning
the honour of europe depends on our speaking out for these young arabs for this great people being consigned to the night
let washington s nebuchadnezzar let these people go these slaves in their own country
they must be released from this poverty
i appeal to your consciences
europe is denying itself
there is no time to lose this people could cease to exist
mr president ladies and gentlemen i ask you to act quickly
we have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions
mr president i can only endorse the speeches that have just been made especially mr morillon s
we certainly cannot continue to accept this situation
mr president this does not mean we are releasing the iraqi regime from its responsibilities and obligations
and here i differ slightly from mr collins
the fact is the discrepancies between iraq and the international community do not justify maintaining the embargo
remember the iraqi people are innocent
he decided to resign
it must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians
the right of coercion over populations  it must also be remembered  should not lead to the right to starve them
that is also one of the great principles of western civilisation
mr president our resolution is very consistent
mr president that is the only way dictatorships can really be weakened and concord between all the peoples of the region promoted
for once europe must speak with a european voice
mr president mr morillon has already explained my group s position which is in favour of this joint resolution
for my part i would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important
it is truly contradictory that this parliament cannot obtain a council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this
the conference of presidents is shortly to meet here in strasbourg in order to establish the programme for the forthcoming partsessions and it could issue a request along the lines that you have suggested
we should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider
i had the opportunity to visit iraq last month
i met the families of the kuwaiti prisoners
mr president the commission shares the concern expressed during this debate
it regrets iraq s decision not to accept united nations security council resolution 
in this regard we agree with the draft resolution
the debate is closed
the vote will take place this afternoon at  pm
chechnya
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr markov mr vinci mr papayannakis and mrs ainardi on behalf of the guengl group on chechnya
b by mrs malmstrom mr haarder mr maaten and baroness nicholson of winterbourne on behalf of the eldr group on chechnya
b by mr oostlander and mr posselt on behalf of the ppede group on chechnya
b by mr sakellariou and mrs krehl on behalf of the pse group on chechnya
b by mrs schroedter mr cohnbendit and mr gahrton on behalf of the vertsale group on the armed conflict in the republic of chechnya
mr president parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around chechnya for some time
we have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist islamic forces attempts to split chechnya away from the russian federation
we are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world
i believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle
however for several months a war has been raging in chechnya which none of these arguments can justify
i spent over six years of my life in russia and have very close ties with that country
i find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the russian army
in the long term this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict
mary robinson obtained limited access
she was not allowed to meet the russian president and was treated in a most humiliating way
the witnesses she had met had told of murders of civilians summary trials executions rapes torture and kidnappings
domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind
we have a global responsibility to defend basic rights
abuses of these cannot  must not  be seen as internal matters
the un s high commissioner must continue to be supported in his work
the european parliament has on a number of occasions expressed concern about the situation in chechnya
we presume that russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely
we also hope that the eu can eventually contribute to a reconstruction programme in the region
mr president what has happened in the war in chechnya has shocked us all
at one stage chechen generals even invaded dagestan an action which merited absolutely no sympathy whatsoever
this illustrates that there are various movements within chechnya
on the one hand there are the military who tend to play the afghan card or count on iran for support
the other two groupings seek more of a political solution
mr president the president of chechnya has limited control over the troops in his country
we are pleased to hear that maskadov does not support the actions of his military
we are also delighted to hear that the russians are at long last admitting to the fact that mr putin is contacting the chechen authorities indirectly
we have also noted hat the council of europe has adopted a position in this regard
we know from the russian delegation that was here until yesterday that this has hit them exceptionally hard and we spoke about it with them in detail
we have even noted that the council of europe itself is showing more courage than this parliament
what is a proportionate use of force in a case such as chechnya
what proportion are we talking about
this is unacceptable
what is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in chechnya
perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children
perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals
please explain this to us
there is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build
either we have human rights or we do not have human rights
let there be no mistake we should not let mr putin get away with that
this joint delegation needs to set off without delay
it would be a great step forward if this succeeded
what we want to see is a new russia not a seamless transition from the soviet union but a new russia
that is what we should condemn
unfortunately russia is only accepting this in words not in deeds
that is why i think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists
this is the formula we need condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation after which we must take whatever steps are necessary
and if those steps have to be harsh ones then we should in full awareness of the facts not shrink back from taking them
mr president once again we are discussing the situation in chechnya
as the european parliament has emphasised the russian authorities have failed to respond satisfactorily to these requests
the debate is closed
the vote will take place this afternoon at  pm

jewish prisoners in iran
mr president what is the purpose of this joint resolution
what fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the iranian authorities
to start with a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused
the latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox jewish community in shiraz
and so these thirteen jews are being threatened with the death penalty
and remember this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in march 
what position should the european parliament take in this tough domestic political struggle with regard to the specific case of the thirteen jews from shiraz
our amendment in paragraph  is based on this very consideration
and in their view the abolition of the sharia is equivalent to the abolition of the present iranian form of government
in short this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen jews from shiraz
that would really add a happy chapter to the almost  years of history of the jewish community in the land of the persians
god willing that is what we shall see
mr president the trial of thirteen iranian jews accused of espionage has opened today in teheran
the trial is taking place behind closed doors
these people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about
their lawyers some of whom are state appointed were only allowed to look at the files the day before yesterday
there is no guarantee of the right to a defence
i am afraid this may only be a mock trial
yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty
when the case started we had the privilege of hearing some leading government dignitaries publicly call for the prisoners to be put to death straight away
this case which was built up from nothing  i think we are all convinced of that  has mobilised international public opinion powerfully
but some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences
the government s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well
they were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute
it is also clear that the outcome of this trial partly depends on how the iranian political situation evolves
there is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen iranian jews will be used by one faction against another in step with domestic conflicts
justice has little place in that kind of battle and human rights even less
so it is imperative that we react
we must also call on the union governments to do the same
today a new trial is starting in shiraz in the south
thirteen jews and eight moslems have also been detained for a year in iranian jails facing death by hanging
the youngest is only sixteen years old
when the more moderate elements won the last elections we thought our call had been heard
in other words we are disappointed disappointed and alarmed
we are continuing to insist that the international community be able to follow the proceedings from start to finish
furthermore at the request of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party the european parliament is urgently calling on the council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners
there is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved
our feelings are as strong as our concern
we must make ourselves perfectly clear
iran s possible return to the bosom of the international community has a price today
we hope the council and the commission will rally unequivocally to our position
we must remain intransigent on this point  human rights are not negotiable
they were put on trial for it and hanged
who are the accused
it is hard to understand how these people are endangering iranian democracy
what are they supposed to have done
no one really knows
we do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done
a letter to a family in israel may have been enough to set this case in motion
in a previous resolution and in repeated letters supported by the president we asked to be allowed to visit the prisoners
that was refused
we then asked to meet the families who are not sworn to secrecy as far as i know
that was also refused
we asked  in a unanimous resolution  to be able to attend the trial
up to now that has been refused
mr president ladies and gentlemen the group of the greenseuropean free alliance wholeheartedly supports the joint resolution that will be put to the vote today
i agree with all the previous speakers
today is a special day  april  the date of the socalled trial 
in    and  resolutions were sent from the european parliament to iran but what happened to them
the youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight
the reason espionage
yet again
requests have been made to send letters but to no avail
they are hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals among other things
three of the thirteen have been allowed to choose a lawyer and the others have had lawyers forced upon them
the jewish communities are afraid
what is likely to happen
people disappear they are locked up but for how long either that or they are used for cattle trading
it is very worrying and must be followed up
i hope that iran will act wisely and responsibly and not with hatred
that seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights
these  who were arrested were arrested in secret nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months
in addition these  were all religious leaders or leaders of the jewish community
therefore we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the jewish community in iran
let us send our message very clearly from this chamber
if iran claims to respect human rights trials like this should never be allowed to happen
 el mr president we were most satisfied to see president khatami s forces of modernisation strengthened during the recent elections in iran
akin birdal
mr president turkey is now standing at a crossroads
it can choose the past it can choose oppression and barbarity or it can choose the future freedom and humanitarianism
akin birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement in spite of his illhealth
we must say to the turkish government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past
this type of behaviour does not belong to the future where we hope that human rights will be foremost
such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires
my advice to turkey must be choose the future and free akin birdal and his colleagues
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party supported this proposal
we hope that we shall one day be able to welcome turkey into the community
we believe that this message gives an important signal to the turkish people
many of us had hoped for improvements in this area
it is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis
he had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds
he must be released immediately
in the eu we are proud not merely to be an economic club
everyone both existing and future members must respect these criteria
unfortunately turkey still has a long way to go
the european parliament has no intention whatsoever of allowing the micronationalist miasma which has just drenched the balkans in blood to develop in turkey
at any rate that is my interpretation of minority rights
that is the purpose of the draft resolution we will be voting on shortly
mr president two weeks ago we met akin birdal in ankara at the offices of the eu delegation
these were his words to us then for five months we have had a new turkey
in addition the internal armed conflict has ceased and our relations with greece have improved 
those were akin birdal s words
akin birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed ill health 
however he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy
he also of course forfeited the right to be chairman of the human rights foundation
his socalled crime was that he had spoken about the kurdish people on world peace day
because of this crime and in accordance with article  of the law in force he was sentenced to one year s imprisonment and ordered to pay fines
akin birdal is a gentle and peaceful man
he still suffers from the aftereffects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 
what we are seeing in this case is how an undemocratic system imprisons persecutes and oppresses democrats
in  he survived an assassination attempt by rightwing extremists but since then his health has greatly deteriorated
from mr schorling s statement it appears very clear that this is in no way coincidental
it is real provocation
through this kind of action turkey alienates itself from europe
the gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round
this is not the only instance of human rights violations that concern us
i understand that a press bureau in amsterdam has been ransacked and that this was formally sanctioned by the belgian judiciary
in the meantime we also know from incidents in belgium who is really behind this
akin birdal is not a kurd
no one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature
and yet he has had to endure great suffering
leyla azan is still in prison and so are thousands of kurds
when will this end
there is no justification for the behaviour of the turkish government
the european union has accepted turkey s candidacy and now the turkish government must respect our agreements and conventions
tibet
mr president from all accounts the human rights situation in china has deteriorated considerably
the european union cannot continue to turn a blind eye
europe is laboriously and extremely inconsistently shaking off her lethargic attitude to the horrors taking place in chechnya
the chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with his holiness the dalai lama and political repression is on the increase
people are being mercilessly persecuted and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed
tibet s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated
these continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue
the united states needs the support of the european union at the th un commission on human rights in geneva
the european union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights
if it takes the first step other countries including the candidate countries will certainly follow suit
my own group the group of the european people s party is firmly convinced of this
commissioner lamy europe needs to stick its head above the parapet
point one tibet must become a peace zone
point two china must finally renounce its policy of expulsion
point three democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities
point four tibet s culture and environment must be protected
point five genuine negotiations must take place on tibet s future autonomous status
how did a tibetan delegate put it
we will survive because of your moral support but above all because of your solidarity 
tashi delek
mr president as you are calling on each member in his own language perhaps you could address me in bavarian
eight years ago i was rapporteur on tibet
in  i presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the european parliament
the tibetans human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction especially in tibet itself
nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before
mr mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this
a great many people are involved here
the fundamental right of selfdetermination is all too often ignored possibly for reasons of political convenience
i am sure a large majority of the house agrees with you
death penalty in the united states
things are changing in the united states
from this point of view i feel we can congratulate ourselves
in this way the usa has brought itself into line with china congo and iraq
those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us
every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary
this is by no means an enviable record
more specifically i would ask our american friends to abolish it once and for all
mr president we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important
thirdly there are  prisoners currently in federal death row  are black  are white one is asian and one is latino
when we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the us is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process
that is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the us
in this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 
that is why we urge president clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions
there is a presidential campaign under way
in a presidential campaign executions regrettably become a political football in the us
president clinton has the opportunity  he is not standing for reelection  to make a stand on this issue today
the death penalty is a political arm used by the american government apparatus to settle accounts with militants like mumia abu jamal
it is also a penalty whose irreversible character makes any reparation impossible if a mistake is made  and mistakes are often made
 pt mr president ladies and gentlemen the death penalty was abolished in portugal over a century ago
so for the portuguese being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture
mr president my group firmly supports this resolution
the american election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this
sad to say just the opposite has happened and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue
zimbabwe
mr president this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in zimbabwe
we must therefore all encourage zimbabwe to move towards elections in may
the old parliament was dissolved on  april and president mugabe pledged at the euafrica summit in cairo that the elections would go ahead
it is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set
this could take up to three months
i hope that when the elections are called observers from europe will be invited to zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings
this would show real transparency
it is not for europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation
african countries must work together to consolidate their future
the new partnership agreement goes further and asks for good governance
i particularly highlight land issues
zimbabwe has much to gain from the partnership agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief
much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement
the zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future
we have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in south africa
at the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from zimbabwe
there are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy
the court rulings were ignored
what is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason
the only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of president mugabe
land reform is necessary
there are many landless farmers and unemployed people in zimbabwe
it must however take place lawfully
finally i should like to say something about the war that is currently raging in a certain part of africa
one can think of a whole range of things
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to begin by expressing my confidence in the people of zimbabwe
these people have over the last few years shown that they deserve our confidence
as one of the leading sadec countries it was at the forefront of the battle against apartheid in south africa
it would be particularly sad if this country of all countries became the victim of war racism and civil strife
these problems will not be resolved by letting the zimbabwean army fight in the congo
the country cannot afford such a drain on its resources as is evident from the economic situation
neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems
land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections
these have been announced for june at the very latest
in my view zimbabwe deserves our confidence
the population has chosen the path of development
i hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this
with this in mind we support the resolution
mr president on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists i should like to agree with the comments made by my fellow meps
i believe that we have a reasonable common position
after all this issue is so important for so many black and poor people
the elections are therefore necessary
the rule of law is necessary
you need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly
it is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the congo
let us express our complete confidence in the zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for  june
mr president it is five to midnight in zimbabwe
everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute
in the run up to the elections mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents
at the beginning of this month peaceful demonstrators were attacked by his followers while the police looked on
what is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone
similarly mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms
the government systematically disregards the rulings of the supreme court
in fact the public prosecutor warned that any attempt to remove the occupiers could lead to civil war
some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections
but it is already clear that the elections have been rigged
a quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates
the president is still not allowing any foreign observers in
what else has to happen before structural aid is suspended
i would urge the council and the commission not to wait until it is five past midnight
these are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the european union
we cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in zimbabwe for many weeks now
the fact is that hitler is on the loose again  hitler is out and about again there
it should not go unnoticed that the leader of the band that is encouraging these arbitrary acts in zimbabwe chose the name hitler as his own name
he is a gentleman by the name of chenjerai hitler hunzvi
this is what is happening in zimbabwe
that is why we have to take more vigorous action
mr president i will comment on the various issues that have been dealt with during the debate starting with iran
a number of approaches were made last year by the union and by various member states
further approaches and the possible presence of observers at the trial could in our view be part of that perspective
so we will continue to follow up the matter in the context of the detailed examination we carry out every year
as you know we are currently working on a membership partenariat with turkey within the framework of the preaccession strategy
as regards human rights in tibet we also share your concern
as we have done with you many times before we call on china to reenter into dialogue with the dalai lama
we regard the renewal of this dialogue as the only realistic method of achieving a peaceful and durable solution to the tibetan question
we will doggedly continue to raise the case of tibet with the chinese authorities
with regard to the particular case of juan miguel garza the commission is currently working to clarify the facts through our delegation to washington
finally zimbabwe
our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections
all the same we doubt whether such an initiative would be effective in view of the uncertainty surrounding the election preparations
regrettably we interpret these disturbances as forming part of the governing party s election campaign
like the european parliament we utterly deplore them
thank you very much commissioner lamy
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
world education forum
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr miranda and others on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left
b by mr andreasen and mrs sander on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
b by mrs banotti and mrs pack on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and the european democrats
b by mr van den berg and mrs kinnock on behalf the group of the party of european socialists
b by mrs lucas and others on behalf the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
on the world education forum
there has been some progress but unfortunately not enough as yet
as we speak there are  million children in the world who do not go to school
there are  million illiterate adults twothirds of whom are girls and women
the community is the largest donor to many of these countries
it is regrettable that we are not sending our highest official to attend that conference on behalf of the community
we also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children s rights from the commission
a prominent african leader made a very pertinent comment
he said that education is the only existing vaccination against aids
this underlines the seriousness of the problems
many of these children who are not in school are working
unfortunately only  of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education
a hundred and twentyfive million children mainly girls do not receive any education
we are not talking about more money for the development budget but about redistribution within that budget
it is of course also a waste of human resources that this is the way things are
at the copenhagen summit the deadline was changed to 
i am pleased with this resolution
make resources available
this is also our message to the commission
mr president the recent euroafrican summit in cairo has made poverty one of our central concerns
and the first form of violence is failure to provide education
children from families with problems suffer and often do not have access to proper education
they will have far less chance of success in life and the conditions are all present for their children to experience the same situation
we need to invent new responses and new social attitudes
human beings are born in a state of dependency
defenceless babies have no duties
they cannot have any
duties follow awareness and awareness awakens with education
thus a majority of the education programmes financed under the th edf have been devoted to primary education
the funds allocated to this heading represent  of the total amount devoted to education
my last point is the question put by mr van den berg on the doubling of the basic education budget in 
consequently the answer is not no  but it is not entirely yes either
we think the issue needs to be examined country by country to ensure adequate analysis adapted to each case
thank you very much commissioner lamy

the vote will take place at  pm
taiwan
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by mr collins on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group
b by mr haarder and others on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
b by mr jarzembowski and others on behalf the group of the european people s party christian democrats and the european democrats

on taiwan
mr president the elected vicepresident of the island of taiwan has been called the dregs of the nation by the government in beijing
extra troops have been sent to the chinese province of fujian which lies across the water from taiwan
china reacted furiously
lu had shown her true colours as an extremist and incorrigible agitator for the independence of taiwan
according to beijing with her poisonous words she wanted to stir up her taiwanese comrades to hate their fellow countrymen in the mother country ie beijing
that is indeed the case
we know annette lu and the new president of taiwan chen shuibian
their election is the crowning glory of the democratisation process in taiwan
is that a threat to china
the taiwanese have shown that
for the old man in beijing the internal developments in taiwan must be a nightmare
do they really think their threats will bring results
beijing s behaviour confirms our opinion that the future of taiwan lies in the hands of the taiwanese themselves
as europeans we do not need to interfere
the idea that beijing could represent the taiwanese in such organisations is absolutely ridiculous
it is extremely important for this parliament to forge closer links with the elected representatives in taiwan
democratisation in that part of the world is also important for europe
we had the impression that the elections in taiwan were marked by a mature awareness of democracy amongst the population
after a very long period of supremacy by the party in government up to that point  a period lasting over  years  the political scene has been revitalised
these results alone mark a historical turning point
the people of taiwan viewed any attempts by outsiders to influence them with enormous sensitivity
nevertheless everyone involved was aware of the circumstances
chen shuibian was also elected because the previously governing kuomintang party was split by the presence of two candidates
however the kuomintang still has a majority in the taiwanese parliament
chen shuibian is very well aware that a radical proindependence policy would have been condemned to failure
the region needs security and stability
the only way to achieve reconciliation and lasting peace is through positive cooperation and a constructive dialogue between mainland china and taiwan
healthy relations are also needed for economic development
we therefore welcome the fact that both sides in this conflict are seeking a peaceful solution
the prc is officially endeavouring to reach a peaceful solution subject of course to taiwan renouncing its efforts towards independence
our resolution is intended to further democracy in taiwan but the people s republic of china is taking it as an affront
we believe that there is an objective need for taiwan to have a greater presence in the international institutions this parliament can promote that
we must reject these threats since they are absolutely unacceptable but also because they are an objective threat to the dialogue which is so necessary to the resolution of this problem
mr president thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today
the newly elected president reflects taiwan s democratic maturity
i realise of course that the people s republic of china does not understand the word democracy
nevertheless there is no need for them to start panicking just because democratic elections are taking place in a neighbouring state
unfortunately democracy is not infectious
mr president like you we are delighted that the people of taiwan have been able to express a democratic choice for the second time
we call on both beijing and taipei to take the path of dialogue as quickly as possible
we hope to open an office but it is not one of our priorities at the moment
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  pm
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
we shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
relating to the joint resolution on iraq
mr president there is a drafting error in paragraph  of this resolution
i would like to propose  and this is in fact correct in the german version  that we should forward this resolution to the high representative for the cfsp
but it then continues forward this resolution  and the governments of the member states 
i would like to propose an oral amendment so that it reads and the governments of the member states of the united states and of iraq 
this is an oral amendment
are there any objections
if there are no objections mr sakellariou s motion will be adopted
mr perry your objection is political not procedural
mr sakellariou tabled a motion nobody opposed it and so the motion has been adopted
mr president this morning we had a debate on whether or not in future the house should meet in plenary on fridays
mr markov you cannot make this request on your own
the request has to be made by  members
if this request is made by  members i can check on the quorum
thirtynine or  members appear to have stood up and so we must check on the quorum
the current rule is that whoever requests the quorum has to remain in the chamber
other members could have requested the quorum and then not voted
consequently all this may well be crude but it is just a touch more practical
mr president i think it is terribly sad that when we are about to take such important votes some people are trying to obstruct this
i would like to sincerely thank those staff on behalf of my group and i hope on behalf of all of us
they work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting
loud applause
mr president i think we should vote
just one comment if i may i understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum
would you ask the president to invite the committee on constitutional affairs to consider a change to the rules so we can check it electronically
mr cox do you really think we can make this change to the rules of procedure now
i can understand why you would have to take a head count
i would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today
how can you from up there see exactly which people are members and which are staff and what the actual figures are
if you are in agreement i would like to proceed with the vote
other members are asking for the floor but if we continue we will be opening a debate which is completely unrelated to the matter in hand
let us proceed to the vote
relating to the joint resolution on chechnya
mr president i rise to speak about the vote on the chechen resolution
everyone has agreed to this specific proposal
the president cut the speaker off
at the request of mr sakellariou the motion for resolution b has been withdrawn
vote continuation
perhaps you could let me know later
mr president i just wanted to ask why we are not voting on ethiopia now
mr swoboda the vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning
mr president now the vote is over i would like to come back to the issue of a quorum
it would save time if you tried that first
for example today there were  in the first vote after the issue of the quorum was raised
if there had been a check with cards maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count
ms mckenna this is not an issue that can be resolved right now in this chamber
both your interventions  this one and the one you made earlier  have been recorded
we will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the rules of procedure
it is not an issue that we can deal with now
mr president do you feel young
i think you are saying that you do
it is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed
a longerterm programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time
increasing our young people s skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim
our young people are europe s future
we must encourage them to learn about others and about the european union as well as developing their own values ideas and skills
it is important that they are able to participate in voluntary work abroad school exchanges and learning languages
our society does not have enough confidence in young people
the european youth initiative is a first step in that direction and bears witness to a growing awareness of young people in the eu institutions
graca moura report a
gasoliba i bohm eldr
we have supported this report but there are two aspects which we are not happy with
i would like to remind you that this parliament recognised catalan as a european language and gave it a specific personality
mr president i voted for the establishment of the european year of languages 
this is without any doubt a major positive step although in my opinion every year should be a year of languages
mr president i would like to give an explanation of my negative vote on the report on the european year of languages
this statement is thoroughly valid for lesserused languages
all of them are already bilingual
it is completely wrong to exclude minority languages from this initiative
it is regrettable that this house has not accepted the important services that lesserused languages could contribute to the success of this initiative
i am glad the european parliament and the council have agreed to make  the european year of languages
speaking a language other than one s mother tongue undoubtedly broadens the mind
this practice needs to be disseminated to the other member states
of course we must ensure that this knowledge is not confined only to the better off in society
to show that it would be better for the two partners to use an identical logo and slogan
i am in favour of people being multilingual but i am sorry we are not trying to develop the teaching of esperanto in parallel
it is a language with european roots and easy to understand but also rich and subtle
as an auxiliary language it can provide one means amongst others of facilitating communication between all european citizens
i therefore regret that it is not mentioned in this proposal
there are people who prefer esperanto as a form of communication across national borders
it is also important for posterity to carry out research into languages which are dying out
it ought to be possible to spend the proposed sums of money on other things for which reason we are completely abstaining from voting
 nl i am pleased with the report by mr graca moura the rapporteur and i am grateful to him that my amendments have been adopted
foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration
a third series of amendments that i have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective member states
it is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one member state to another
the member states are therefore inherently asymmetrical in this regard
i hope that the council will endorse this initiative and that we shall be able to start the specific activities as soon as possible because there is a lot to be done

speaking another european language can clearly be a key to success for those young people
i am convinced that other operations of a similar nature should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the european union
dary report a
maes vertsale
the problem however is the price
i think our acp partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote
these are delicate negotiations and at this stage the uk does not rule out an eventual tariff only system
this is the context in which we have supported the dary report while being against amendments nos  and 
it is unacceptable that in the dary report again a transitional period of ten years is proposed without putting a definitive ruling first

we demand protection for agricultural labourers who should not be the victims of the commercial war raging on the world market
in attempting to reconcile the contradictory interests of all parties in the end it has not been able or has not wished to achieve this
import duties and production subsidies are incompatible with our liberal values
in our view it is only through a system of free trade that longterm sustainable global economic development can be created

i feel that the only way to prevent wars is precisely to be closely aware of the tangible problems of other peoples
under the circumstances entrusting the stability of this region to the european powers is the same as having the wolf look after the sheep
our vote against this report expresses our opposition to the past and present policies of the european powers
people are always saying that southeastern europe is the european union s crisisriven back yard
the political context in this region is extremely sensitive and came to a climax in the kosovo conflict
other countries in the region like bulgaria and romania have also suffered serious economic repercussions
the european union was traumatised by its powerlessness in the face of the process of violent disintegration at work in the balkans
the pact is part of the global stabilisation approach the european union has been developing since 
negotiations are currently taking place with macedonia
croatia where positive political changes have recently occurred should be involved in the near future
these agreements are individually tailored to take account of the specific situation in each country
above all they give the countries of this crisisriven region an important political signal and a definite incentive

the elderly need to familiarise themselves with new commerce techniques as well as young people
we regret that our amendment was not approved
however i have not been able to vote for it because it still contains inconsistencies after the plenary vote
the establishment of a paneuropean equity listing would also be aberrant
harmonised yet competitive listings guarantee a diversity of investment products
i have not voted for paragraph  which is mostly incomprehensible in french anyway
kuckelhorn report a
fatuzzo ppede
when we cook spaghetti which is a delicious italian national dish we use a colander a container full of holes which drains the water off the spaghetti
for this reason we must replace the national state pension schemes with private supplementary and alternative pension schemes
the opposite is true of course
right now there is a considerable need for reform in member states retirement pension systems

i spoke yesterday on the kuckelhorn report as draftsperson of the opinion of the committee on women s rights
subsidiarity and free choice require this
prudential rules must not be disproportionate to ensuring that the funds are secure
they must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise
they must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy
in the absence of agreement on certain essential points i am unable to vote for the general framework
palacio vallelersundi report a
not only does the european parliament report support this approach it also calls for the relevant measures to be speeded up
the starting point for the proposed objectives are what are typically referred to as the enormous benefits of the internal market
however no explanation is given as to who will benefit from and who will suffer under this procedure
in other words even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications
in the light of the success of earlier campaigns on the euro the results of these are still to be established
that concludes the explanations of vote
com in milk
with this amendment to the regulation the commission would be empowered to amend the list of goods not covered by annex 
the commission already has this power in the area of agricultural produce such as grain sugar rice and eggs
it would be logical if this power were extended to cover milk products
this would be the case as a result of the amendment
there has been some discussion that the transfer of power from the council to the commission might not be such a good thing
my own view on this and on such situations as this is that it is what we call a zerosum game
this has nothing whatsoever to do with shifting the balance of interinstitutional power
i think it is rooted in common sense and a very farreaching sense of consistency
i believe the committee on agriculture and rural development is also unanimous on this
this amendment to the regulation must be made
it will be a very good and positive move for everyone and agricultural and dairy producers in particular
we have a slogan in german which says milk cheers up tired chaps 
i know that the member states have taken widely differing views of this not least in council meetings
is this really what is intended for the entire milk sector
i would be grateful if you could give me a couple of answers in a moment when we consider whether this really is efficient
would the commission not agree that in this context the expression efficient use is rather euphemistic
what does efficient mean in plain language
in this case efficient quite simply means abolishing export refunds for milk products
do you have real calculations and reliable figures for this what will the situation be then
the rapporteur mr pesala has of course already pointed out that this will also hit other products
there are also other export products such as cakes and pastries which contain milk components
i am sure that you will be able to explain this in your statement in a moment
i think i might find it rather difficult to explain to the farmers at home
so i would like to ask once more  is the abolition of these export refunds really unavoidable
i am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i would like to thank you very sincerely mr pesala for your report
so what is this all about
as the rapporteur has already explained the commission already has this power for cereals sugar rice and eggs
why
this year for the last time we can exceed the wto upper limit of eur  million by the amounts not used in 
let us compare last year we had eur  million and next year will only be able to spend eur  million
we believe that it would have been unwise to make this enormous change from  to  in one go
so we have introduced an interim stage this year
our wto commitments and budgetary discipline mean that we have to adopt a selective approach
you gave yoghurt as an example and it is a good one as it demonstrates how illogical a system can be
is that logical
surely you can see that
in conclusion i would like to say that i find it discriminatory if milk only cheers up tired chaps
why not weary women as well
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
com in milk
i found that remarkable in itself
it is remarkable how casual we in europe sometimes are about food
it is always there and in itself is no problem
this has been borne out by studies
the european commission has also commissioned a study
there is an expansion in the number of products that can be used in the school milk regulation
that in itself makes for a stronger case
anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong
you must also be realistic
this can easily be justified socially within the budget and in respect of a sound nutritional policy
mr president on the basis of the information provided i shall wholeheartedly recommend this report
i hope it will lead to a constructive position with regard to the implementation of this report
i understand that in any case the council of ministers will meet next monday
it would therefore be an appropriate moment if parliament were to approve this report and the school milk regulation
mr president at the request of mr cunha i am presenting our statement on this debate on the school milk scheme
for more than  years the european union has been financing the free distribution of milk in primary and secondary schools
there are two main reasons justifying this measure and why it should continue
the main beneficiaries are children and young people from disadvantaged social classes and poorer districts in both rural and urban areas
mr president mr maat has committed himself most impressively to the issue of school milk
that is a good thing
i myself am a great supporter of school milk
in fact i think that not only children but adults too should drink more milk
i regret therefore that there is no fresh milk available at the parliament building in brussels
i do hope that mr maat s next battle will concentrate on making fresh milk available in brussels
having said that i do not support mr maat s proposals
nevertheless on  december the commission decided not to withdraw the measures but to halve the subsidy
i have asked the commission a number of questions in this regard
i asked commissioner fischler to what extent this measure corresponded with the subsidiarity principle
nor is it clear to me in the school milk regulation how much will be spent on administration costs
it is such a small proportion of the overall milk production that i feel that this weighs particularly heavily on the european commission budget
i am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement
i am not an opponent of school milk as such but i do object to the way we are going about it
i believe that the commission must confine itself to the core tasks and leave other matters to the member states
i support the commission proposal but not the proposals of the committee on agriculture and rural development
mr president i would like to thank mr maat for a good report and good cooperation namely in his raising the issue of public health
until now the basis for pricing has favoured fattier products
in that respect it has to continue and as mr maat said be brought up to date and this issue which is in the common good should be promoted
i ask you sincerely is that what you want to see happening
the proposals before us definitely militate against that
can i suggest to you what might happen as a result
there are two possibilities
we all acknowledge the aim here
it is to cut milk subsidies
this is the age of nongm food and organic products and the proposals before us represent a major step backwards
let us be clear
several member states will not operate this scheme at all if the present subsidy is withdrawn or decreased
that is the reality of the situation
this would be a catastrophe not only for the health of schoolchildren  our future citizens  but to the viability of communities also
i am not proud of that
it is an indication of our deprived status
cutting the subsidy however would make my community even poorer a community whose farmers have lost  of their income in  /  years
this is not the european union that i thought my nation had joined
we were looking to a europe of cohesion that seeks to bolster its deprived communities and help its poorest citizens
this is not unique to my nation
sadly it affects other nations as well
farmers then are told to diversify to become multifunctional
these are the buzzwords now in the european union
yet they have already diversified
they have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible
it is time we rewarded them particularly in the peripheral and deprived communities of the european union
cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees
this continued erosion of the milk industry is i am afraid part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry
i believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities
at the present moment in time that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies
defending communities is far far more important
we must keep our milk farmers farming and the communities where they earn their living as viable entities
the agricultural committee deserve every support in this regard
mr maat has done well in a very difficult situation and i wish him every success
that role finds particular resonance in this age of eating disorders and unhealthy diets
for example the increase in the number of obese children in europe as a result of the culture of sweet highly coloured fizzy drinks is alarming
must we remind people that milk provides a crucial part of our protein calcium vitamin and mineral requirements
it strengthens the capacity of young children who drink it to protect themselves against diseases caused by nutritional anarchy
mr maat rightly mentions the way eating patterns change with our changing lifestyle
nor do we forget that some children from very deprived backgrounds skip breakfast for financial reasons
these children are exposed to dietary deficiencies and have difficulty concentrating at school
the commission is washing its hands of all this while heading up lots of other programmes that cost a great deal more
why undermine the very one which affects the health of european children
the president cut the speaker off
i also hope and trust that they will begin to appreciate and to continue to drink milk
milk provides a very healthy and balanced diet something we should all support
the european union should take that on board
it is good value for money
we do not always achieve that
we have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are
i want to thank mr maat
mr president for years i have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed
i think it is complete nonsense
it is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer
currently fullcream milk is fully subsidised semiskimmed milk is semisubsidised and skimmed milk receives no subsidy
we should instead award subsidies per pupil
i would have preferred it if we had set milk prices lower so that we could abolish the bureaucratic milk quotas
however the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes
it is not just beneficial to farmers
children do not need so much fat
furthermore a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer
there is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme
i have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme
it is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese
the schools often end up having to pay back large sums
it is not that they are out to cheat they simply cannot work out how to administer the scheme
i think therefore that we must vote for the amendments of my good colleague and friend niels busk
the scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one
mr president i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur mr maat for his report which i support in its entirety
and thanks as ever for the usual good work of the committee on agriculture and rural development
i would also like to thank my good colleague and close friend freddy blak of the socialist group for his support for my amendment
the school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition
in this way the scheme takes account of the differences in the milk traditions which exist in the different member states
as soon as the term cofinancing is mentioned in terms of agriculture people s hackles rise
many see cofinancing as the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy
the committee on agriculture and rural development is also against the commission s plans
with such a viewpoint parliament can make the most of it
are we not kidding ourselves and the sector with this attitude
is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term
i do not think so
we shall have to make do with the financial package established in agenda  and to deal with the enlargement of the union
if agricultural policy is not changed we shall not be able to pay for it
the union should develop its policy within this context
the main question here is how can we operate as efficiently as possible with the limited resources of the european union
is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere
if we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support then that is urgently required
if we do not do that then the commission will undoubtedly try in other ways to remain below the agricultural ceiling
what do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements
those who are against cofinancing bring such painful economies a lot closer
we do not wish to be part of that
some of the amendments proposed in mr maat s report in effect totally reject the commission proposal
i cannot therefore accept the amendments in question which are amendments nos      and 
it is quite simply wrong to say that the level of aid will drop from schoolchildren s point of view
i am also quite happy to concede that there are health nutrition and social policy objectives here
amendments nos   and  are designed to cover a broader range of milk products under the scheme
in this respect the commission would like to maintain the existing scheme in which the selection of subsidised products is a matter for the commission
thank you for your attention
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
vertical restraints
the commissioner knows the subject and the members who are still to speak on this matter know at least as much as i do about it
i should now like to ask a few questions
first of all are we going to receive the evaluation which we asked for after three or four years of new policy in the sphere of vertical restraints
we can expect an evaluation to be made this year by the commission
when will we receive it and has the commission already consulted the automobile distribution sector and particularly the small distributors
mr president commissioner my colleague mrs thyssen has produced some excellent work and i wish to congratulate her on it
these issues cause problems at least in my home country of finland and in other small member states
it is important to define unambiguously the relevant markets referred to in article  of the block exemption regulation
the guidelines have not defined sufficiently precisely how the market share of a manufacturer and a wholesaler should be determined
i feel this is especially problematic
mr president i am pleased that you knew i was here and that i was going to speak
you know that i do not usually speak too long
i will simply explain the amendments presented by mr berenguer who is unable to attend
these are amendments nos   and 
amendment no  deals with the possibility of freeing the distributor by means of the return of contributions once the contract has finished
amendment no  refers to the setting of prices by the producer  the resale price  in certain cases such as the launch of the product
there are certain cases in which this setting of the resale price can be justified
lastly amendment no  refers to the protection of producers against pressures applied by the distributor to force them to extend the contract
we are talking about exclusive contracts sections  et seq
mr president as we are short of time i will make my statement telegram style
first of all many thanks to you mrs thyssen for your excellent report
second my thanks also to the members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs for supporting this important reform project
the draft is an important step in the reform of competition policy in respect of vertical restraints
furthermore in answer to your question mrs thyssen as to whether there will be a review the answer is yes there will indeed be a review of the guidelines after four years
a first draft of these guidelines will then be transmitted to the european parliament before it is published in the official journal
it is very likely that this will happen before the end of april
i am delighted to report that the european parliament and the commission have worked together closely and constructively on this issue
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments

i therefore wish i had cast my vote the other way
i wish that to be placed on the record
we will include this in the minutes mr maccormick
the minutes were approved
mr president i only wanted to report my presence for the minutes
we can all see mrs van der laan that you are here
it will be included in the minutes
vote
the fact is that according to members of various groups the agenda on fridays is too light as a result of which many members genuinely believe that their time can be spent more productively elsewhere
consequently there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here
we therefore believe that a choice needs to be made either we need to give more substance to friday s agenda or to abolish the friday sitting
in this context i wish to ask for the quorum to be checked
i think that we all know the rules by now
mrs buitenweg you cannot request this on your own
such a request must be made by at least  members
i will check if there are sufficient members present who wish to check the quorum
i notice that more than  members have made this request
we will have to establish whether there is a quorum
the number of members present was counted
they also specify that the outcome of the vote shall not be made known
it is up to the president to establish that there is no quorum
more than  members rose in support of this request
the president established that there was not a quorum
mr president i have been trying to catch your eye for a while now
mr president we have checked when exactly these people are present on fridays
it appears that evidently no friday is important enough for these people to turn up
they have had their little pleasures mr president
they were able to appear on radio and television last week
mr president i cannot accept this and would like to offer my apologies as i feel ashamed on their behalf
i notice that a few other members would like to be given the floor on this point of order
we should however bring this to a close very shortly
i am now giving the floor to mr schulz
we do have individual opinions within our group
the delegates in the socialist group are not unanimous here
i would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process
i do not think this is fair to these delegates
applause
we are here to work and those who are not here to work are preventing us from doing so
mr schulz is right this is completely immoral
this is absurd and we are making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the whole of europe
we cannot go on like this
needless to say we will discuss this matter
i think that goes without saying
i still have many requests from members to speak
i am now giving the floor to mr medina ortega
four meps have left the chamber
the practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber
mr medina ortega we need to straighten a few things out
we are now working within the rules of procedure
since the start of the new parliamentary term it has been defined very clearly that every member is allowed to leave the chamber
the doors will remain open
this is the quorum provision as it stands at the moment and this is the one i am applying
mr bourlanges said that we carry on voting if there are fewer than  members in the chamber
this is not the case
the rules of procedure stipulate that if there are fewer than  members in total present in the chamber then there is no vote
mr posselt there are many points of order to cover
i am giving you the floor for the last time
we have given everyone including the presidents the opportunity to change the agenda if this was considered necessary
nobody acted upon this
i have not heard of any action to change the agenda even on the part of the members who are now complaining
we will challenge the quorum for each item on the agenda today this will cause some irritation
mrs van der laan i understand that you would like the quorum to be checked
according to the rules of procedure a vote is to be taken on this
we need to check whether there are  members who wish to support you
more than  members rose in support of this request the president established that there was no quorum
i too noticed members leaving the chamber during the count
this behaviour does not contravene the rules of procedure but it is contrary to the notion of fair play and the proper functioning of parliament
applause
that is not a serious way of doing things
if parliament has to work on friday then people must be here
what we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing parliament s own rules
that can hardly be called frivolous
if the rules had been different we would have acted differently
therefore some of the  members have violated the rules of procedure
this is not the way things are done
you can ask for the quorum to be checked but the vote is on the agenda
would you like to get the quorum checked now
more than  members rose in support of this request the president established that there was no quorum
my second point is an appeal to the delegates
mr mayer i can assure you it is not just me who casts my eye through the chamber
i also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity
we can monitor all corners of the chamber
i actually think that i have not made too bad a job of it
concerning night flights these will be discussed in a moment
we will see how the point on the agenda unfolds
i am now giving the floor to mrs flesch
everyone is of course free to act as they like
information and communication
it is extremely important that we explain to the union s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries what the union stands for
an information and communication strategy must therefore be high on our agenda
i would much rather that the commission s office in copenhagen was a little more accessible
he must understand that brussels means all of us together as commission president prodi put it
i believe that you share many of my views mrs reding
it is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and europe
moreover let me tell you quite explicitly that i have taken careful note of the problems which exist
i must tell you too that there are some things which are working well it is not all bad
we have our euroinfopoints and information outlets in the member states which generally speaking are very successful
along with the honourable member i admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate and i shall indeed make every effort to achieve this
the honourable member also mentioned modern technology
that must be taken into consideration
we must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established
i also think we must all clarify our respective roles
obviously the parliament s role is different to that of the commission
i am deeply convinced that parliament s special role must continue
any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution
we must also openly and objectively look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past
that mr president is what i wanted to say for the time being
mr president i would like to thank commissioner reding for her response to mr andreasen
we have a very committed commissioner in commissioner reding
i find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the eu
the information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about
in a sense the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem
in the recent past we have had the oostlander report in  and the famous pex report in 
they have analysed the problem suggested improvements but sadly little has been achieved
i wish commissioner reding well in getting on with this problem
however you could write what they knew about the aims of the eu on the back of a one euro note
when i speak to british groups i often start with the question do you want to be in the european union
the immediate response i got this week was no
five or six years ago the response would have been yes but we do not want too much interference
this situation is getting worse
i know that it is a particular problem for the united kingdom but it is not exclusive to the united kingdom
it is getting worse right across europe
we only have to look at the turnout in the european parliamentary elections to see that
why is this so
why this lack of enthusiasm for the eu
to begin with we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product
even if you have a firstclass product if you do not market it properly it will not sell
we must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively
i fear we are doing neither
it has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century
now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in yet my constituents want to get out
let me just suggest a few possibilities
what happened to president prodi s idea of a rapid rebuttal unit
if it is in existence it does not appear to be very effective
the commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good
we must make more and better use of it
with the plethora of new tv channels with digital tv have we got anywhere with a parliamentary tv channel
i can watch the us senate on television gaveltogavel
but not the european parliament
we must emphasise the goodnews stories of when we help the citizen
we have a committee on petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year
when did the information departments of the commission or parliament last attend a meeting of that committee
when did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee
finally i have to address the problem of parliament in strasbourg
i am not antistrasbourg
i am certainly not antifrance
in the st century i am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency
i ask parliament commission and the council of ministers to address that problem
you have mentioned two aspects which i would like to stress the regional dimension and efficiency
the aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens
this goes hand in hand with efficiency
in your review of information policy i would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain member states
for example during the euro campaign there was an agreement at the time between the european commission and the government of a member state
that government s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency
that advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed
however that it is not the way to reach the public nor is it efficient
therefore it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation
the commission has long had an office there
the commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions as well as the states in its communication policy
it is rumoured that bbc scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from brussels
that would be a disaster
it is not just the commission and parliament which need to think about their role
our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of europe
may i mention one other sad case which is of importance in the area of information and communication
i want to draw attention yet again to the case of the italian language lecturers
that really must be taken seriously
mr president a distinction must be made between information and propaganda
mr prodi s commission has started off badly with regard to information
this means information and propaganda from above
actually this means the spread of propaganda not information
the commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting that of public accessibility
the commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility which by any common yardstick is an untenable document more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility
this is the commission s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility
public accessibility is just as important as information
there is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn
in addition the way parliament disseminates information must be criticised
it has one internet connection
we thank you for this
i do not think that it was
it is a matter of community promotion and not selfpromotion
we cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of maastricht and amsterdam
commissioner i am waiting for your master plan your schedule your specific measures for implementation
please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule
in any case this is the impression i gained from the comments of the honourable members
may i first answer mr perry
he said that the situation is getting worse
that is a very negative way of seeing things
probably the honourable member is right
i just hope the situation is not getting worse everywhere
that would be terrible
but if it is getting worse anywhere we have to take that very seriously
we cannot just say that it is getting worse and not do anything
we have to act
mr perry has addressed three specific points
firstly the website address should be better known
i know about this problem
on  april we launched the new access facility  europe direct
we will be distributing information about this site to schools and local authorities
regarding a parliamentary tv channel the commission would not object if parliament proposed such an activity
however i leave that initiative to parliament
i consider it very important
there are colleagues in this chamber who sat with me on that committee some years ago
it is the committee most concerned with the europe of the citizen
if parliament decided to take action visavis the citizens by utilising the committee on petitions you can rest assured that the commission would support it
if information were to be issued solely from strasbourg or solely from brussels it would not reach the public
in practice the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme
of course i cannot intervene in that respect
it is a private decision of the media
the information office in edinburgh will not be closed
so at least regional policy in this area will continue
i hope that the honourable member is wrong and that the provision of information will not ultimately be perceived in this way
i would like to make it quite clear once again that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the commission
i am convinced that this information service can work properly only if there is close cooperation between the three institutions in question
if we do not cooperate we will fail miserably
de i thank mr karas for regarding the ways and means with which we will in future tackle information policy as a positive approach
i strongly agree with him that everyone must take a look at themselves to see where we have gone wrong
i have no intention of going into the problems of the information policy of parliament
the parliamentarians must do that themselves but we should all carry out community promotion together
mr karas has quite rightly said that we need the member states
that is also one of the focuses of the new information policy which i would like to introduce in the future
without them there is no way that we can get our information across
there must therefore be a concerted action between the institutions and between the people in our regions in our states
i know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement
but unless we at least make a start then nothing will happen
fr mr president i cannot bring about a revolution singlehanded
this is a joint effort it is a great challenge but i know i can count on your support
applause
thank you commissioner
this is probably the first time i have heard delegates referred to as soldiers but we know what role we are playing here
the debate is closed
yesterday there was a question from mr maccormick on the postponement of the vote on the com for bananas
i share the concerns of mr maccormick
had we voted in accordance with our rules of procedure we would no longer have been involved
that is how it was mr maccormick  he is no longer here
i would like this to be recorded
i am taking note of this
this will be taken care of
i am now giving the floor to mr beysen on a point of order
this will probably be because they have come to realise that they cannot count on the support of at least  delegates
ladies and gentlemen i would like to start the debate
let us not enter into discussion
i will tell you what the rules of procedure are so that we all know where we stand
i am now giving the floor to mr van hulten
mr president our action is not finished
i simply want to refute that our sole aim would be to disturb proceedings
what we do want is to make sure that this parliament can work more effectively and be more credible for the next five years
this is what we are doing
mr speroni let us be absolutely clear about this
deliberation is always possible
i am presiding over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us
mr president i would like to ask a question tongueincheek in the style of loriot where are they then
where are these  and more who stood up before and who will stand up again but who now when we are discussing matters are no longer here
i would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is
night flights and excessive noise

a green paper was presented in  and nothing else has happened since
what has been done to regulate aircraft to date
standards were last established by the international civil aviation organisation in 
i therefore call upon the commission to take action in this area
personally i would prefer a vote in which a large number of members take part to a vote which takes place at noon on friday in which only thirty or forty members participate
frankly that distresses me for a resolution voted in by only a small number of members carries very little weight
i am not at all against strasbourg quite the opposite and i have proved it many times despite the fact that i am belgian
i do not wish to see strasbourg cease working normally from monday to friday
the commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level
i would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits
all this is in the pipeline the commission is working on it and would like to thank parliament for its cooperation on this matter
i have received four motions for resolutions in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place after the debate
mr president noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue
we talked about hushkits not so long ago
i understand from the observations made by the commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on  may next
mr president it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern
at night time in particular this level of pollution is out of all proportion
the number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced
but what is meant by night
at dusseldorf airport night falls at  pm according to mr florenz
but at the end of the day it is the people living near airports who suffer
mr president so what needs to happen
this means thorough research into lownoise engines
this means bans and international standards
it was our own amendment tabled on behalf of the european people s party
that is peace and quiet at night but this also implies a proper zonal structure insulation and sound legislation in europe
this undoubtedly brings many benefits but there are also many drawbacks
the noise pollution at zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time
the quality of life  and sleep  of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard
the solution to this problem has caused great uproar in belgium and in my government
as you know the belgian government embraces people from the blue green and red sections of the political spectrum
i too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone s existence as the supreme good
this is all well and good on paper but this can be very difficult to implement in practice
what is worse
having a very difficult or bad night s sleep day in day out or suddenly losing your job and your income
all of a sudden the trade union and employers joined forces
it is an improvement but not a solution
too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms
we can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at european level
europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations
we would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the union
in this connection we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule
in a recent communication from the commission on air transport and the environment an initial strategy has already been outlined
this is to be welcomed but it is not enough
firstly this does not solve the current problem as mr lannoye has already pointed out
i think that with a little good will this should be feasible
i am looking forward to her reply
an interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists not only for aircraft but also for airports
mrs van brempt already pointed this out we are faced with a dilemma
our question is therefore how can we marry the two together
it is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
because one thing is clear noise must be penalised
a total ban would be ideal of course but can we afford this and where could this be done
we would like to have these questions answered by the commission
when will this happen
for example at schiphol there is a kind of complaints desk for noise
other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one
so why not exchange ideas between the different eu airports where all of us are faced with the same problem
but this is not the case at all
the entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb or even reduce air transport and related noise pollution
no research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports
it is essential to transfer shorthaul air freight transport to the railways
these three matters genuinely require urgent consideration
i imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem
let us hope that it will improve
hence the opportunity for this debate which we should thank mr lannoye for
we should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway
first of all i must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all
regional planning is only a recent introduction whereas airports have existed for a long time
the first flights to operate from malpensa for example began as early as 
in addition provision of information is poor
for example many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights
cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights
the amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft not on what is being transported a cargo boeing  produces much less noise than a passenger boeing 
consequently a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes
then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated
i welcomed the commission s remarks regarding a european legislative framework
for example as has already been said we need to establish what is intended by the word night 
does night start at  pm or at midnight
does it end at  am or at  am
this is something to be taken into consideration
another factor is the involvement of the local authorities for every airport is different
the noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used
local authority involvement is therefore important although i must stress it needs to be within a general european legislative framework
in any case i would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole
mr president noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem to those living near airports
this is in principle a localised problem which should as such be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport
this solution however is not sufficient since aircraft are produced on a global market
in short we are simply shifting the problem
technically speaking the problem is not that enormous
since the lifespan of aircraft is about thirty years the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while
the question is whether this long wait is desirable
i do not think so
the extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user who will pay more for their airline tickets
for the sake of fair competition this should be done on a global scale
i also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution
it should be clear that ideally the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation
it is obvious that this will lead in our densely populated states to increasing noise pollution for citizens
i support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly
i come from the region around the colognebonn airport an extremely densely populated region
we have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens
every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport
the airports of liege and maastricht are within a radius of almost  km
however i have surmised commissioner from the commission s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met
i therefore come to my request you have proposed specific measures to the commission in your report
you have announced a strategy which i welcome for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data
however you have not set any deadline for this
in effect this embraces the three fields of technological economic and regulatory considerations
however at the same time we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue
mr president commissioner i would like to make a few brief comments with regard to our joint resolution
we are discussing night flights noise pollution and especially sleeping disorders
i believe that mrs van brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly
tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone s throw away from the runway
 of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft
needless to say it makes no sense to ban night flights in one member state alone
businesses such as dhl will then simply move to airports in other member states
as a result we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral where the citizens quality of life is pulled down with it
finally i would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller regional airports have to contend with
of course the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living
this is why for the time being the commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights
munich and berlintegel limit night operations to mail freight
a general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities

the question now arises of how to proceed in the future and most importantly when to act
pages  and  of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule
i will not bore you with the details
you have the documents in your possession
the commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely
it has committed itself to precise deadlines
the economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft
in addition the commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice
i would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard
the icao is currently working on drafting a new standard and this is long overdue for the present standards date from   ages ago
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
mr president in principle we should proceed to the vote
it appears that the joint motion for a resolution is approved by all the political groups
there are therefore no complications and there are no amendments
mr lannoye i understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned
you know very well that this motion is to be made either by  members or by a group
are you moving this on behalf of your group
mr president i am of course making this request on behalf of my group
in this case rule  of the rules of procedure applies
 pt mr president i would like to support this suggestion i do not wish to be associated with the sabotage that was perpetrated today
i find this quite incomprehensible and i think that it makes this parliament and us look ridiculous
this is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions
this was the speaker against
is there anyone who would like to speak in favour of the motion
i am giving the floor to mr blokland
mr president i would like to back mr lannoye s motion
we have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against
we will now proceed to vote on mr lannoye s request to adjourn the vote on this item on the agenda
the request was rejected we shall now proceed to the vote
joint motion for a resolution on night flights and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports
it seems to me to be a good thing that this debate has got under way and i would like to extend warm thanks to the members who supported me in this
mrs buitenweg we are voting at the moment
we will not enter into a debate on friday sittings
if you have a request on a point of order i would ask you to submit it now if not i will now proceed to the vote
mr president i accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now
i would like to point out however that the voting will be by rollcall
ladies and gentlemen we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote
this seems to me to be in the interest of the good rules of this house
we are going by the rules
parliament adopted the resolution
that is correct even though i do not approve of her behaviour politically
i do not consider this acceptable
even then a vote is fully valid
mr posselt you are absolutely right
it is a fact that all votes are valid irrespective of the number of those participating
the legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute
if however a right is somehow abused i am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics
i am speaking on a more general note here
what causes me particular regret is that we all have experience of national parliaments and so on and this sort of abuse rarely takes place
it would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not
this will not help us any further this morning
this is clear enough i think
let us move on to the next item
the forestry sector after the december  storms
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the commission
the issue is wider than that
thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector
did we actually intervene
did we employ the means available to us
this time we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the natural disasters heading
in the space of two days  million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market
we are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy
the question has been put to you
what action are you going to take
secondly what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available
if we want to support the market we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield
is the commission prepared to take steps to do this
to what extent has it implemented article  of the treaty which allows it to grant exemptions
to what extent if at all has it approached the wto to request it to grant derogations
what has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector
these are not virtual instruments we have rules such as article  of regulation 
if it has not done so what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks
the matter is urgent
finally i call for the docup development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry
thus the european union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions
to date the commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step
i will come back to this point in a moment
the french authorities may be requested to provide further information
however it is first of all up to the member states to amend their initial programmes
i have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure
the vote will take place after the debate
mr president first of all i would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning
you encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the commission
the intertrade system introduced in france can certainly play a major part in the search for and development of these joint solutions
they are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes
i therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented
it would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production
however the urgency of the situation calls for flexible simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the member states
we do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike
permit me therefore to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow mep and friend gilles savary
we presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this
it was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner
it is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity
however in itself it does not constitute a european solution
the european union must take full responsibility for its citizens
we will expect proposals for solutions soon
we need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold there will certainly be no lack of support from the european parliament
the time has come to move on
but first we must sort out the current consequences of the christmas storms
this involves three things in particular
secondly we must as an exception also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries
well now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the european union
so we are going to use part of the structural funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters
yet we are well aware that this will take time
we cannot support this policy for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others to the detriment of future projects
in my opinion this is really not good enough and we expect tangible measures from the commission
the citizens are calling for immediate action
the resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies
the storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector
the forestry workers salary is shamefully low  a mere  francs
they are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job
we support these legitimate claims
the commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster and strengthen the effectiveness of community texts
this must be remedied and the states concerned must be awarded logistical support in the followup to the initial emergency period
so what has become of these famous practical proposals
the sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest
similarly only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas
the member states are and must continue to be the main operators in forestry policy in europe
this must not however stop europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues
the sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products
in return the community must provide support for these products especially at times of crisis
community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken
in badenwurttemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about  million solid cubic metres
this equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to  lower timber prices
however the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given
tidying up storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work
commissioner i know what i am talking about i am a farmer
i have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and i have seen the state our private woods are in
you can see that
but that this is done quickly and efficiently and above all is sustained long term is an ecological necessity
he indicated as you have today commissioner that you are willing to give consideration to to help 
the president cut the speaker off
mr president the natural disaster which overtook european countries was tragic
yet neither the treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility
moreover the same applies within the framework of regulation 
it is the member state itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid
the commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of regulation 
commissioner you have been extremely active this morning
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
joint motion for a resolution replacing the resolutions on the economic effects of the recent storms on the forestry sector in europe
parliament adopted the resolution
declarations of vote and other declarations
this latter point is especially grave and reprehensible
i hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters
the president cut the speaker off
i am very new to this parliament and i would just like to express my deep disappointment at the incident
i am extremely concerned
once again i apologise to the people of ethiopia
mr president i would like to support what mr daul has just said
for me also the timber trade is something of great importance but then our aid to ethiopia is equally important
that is the real question
mr president like everyone else i am deeply concerned about the situation we have landed up in
i find it disagreeable to have taken part in the votes we have had when there are so few of us
i support the protest action which has been taken here today
we shall be a laughing stock throughout europe
i notice that today we are concluding this sitting with approximately fewer than  members here to make decisions
it is disgraceful
mr president firstly i voted in favour of the last motion and the amendments thereto
that was the formal declaration of vote
it is true that some have left
but i am one of the people who took the initiative and i am still here just as i am here every friday
and this is why the problem has arisen
there is a french saying about the arroseur arrose  the biter being bit
here we have the saboteur sabote  the saboteur hoist with his own petard
they then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken
it is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did
for the first time this morning i joined in the request for the quorum to be established
i am a supporter of strasbourg and a supporter of fridays
however i am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of parliament continues to be carried out should also be present
for that reason i did not go along with it any further
but the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them
you then have to respond accordingly
matters proceeded as was established
the votes which were carried out are proper votes
they are no less valid because only a few delegates participated
mr president i would first of all like to thank the president of this eventful sitting the members present and mrs reding
this is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance
so thank you
and even more seriously it appears that this incident may well be repeated every friday
we simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible
nevertheless we must stop trying to hide
the president cut the speaker off
this amendment was rejected by a large majority
therefore we cannot now make any changes to our practices for the year 
finally i would like to join the members who have spoken in expressing my profound shame at the incident
parliament was prevented from voting to send aid to ethiopia by petty political issues
i feel truly ashamed
mr president i too regret the actions which prevented this house from working this morning
i feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning s events
i have been in this house for  years in all although only  of those as a parliamentarian
in this regard i would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on fridays
however irrespective of that i would like to say that i have repeatedly seen such attempts over these  years
that is how all this came about
that was the consensus and this consensus was reached here
perhaps it is a healthy shock and mr graefe zu baringdorf is perhaps right
but i would ask you to clearly understand that friday was never intended for legislative resolutions
these resolutions are not legislative
thank you mr posselt
adjournment of the session
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
the sitting was closed at  pm
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday  april 
i will do so when you consider it to be appropriate
thank you mr baron crespo
i have taken note of your proposal
madam president i rise to speak on the same matter
we have just learnt that the brother of taoufik ben brik has been sentenced to three months in prison
i therefore feel that the immediate future could be decisive in terms of reminding the tunisian authorities of their responsibilities
madam president i am going to raise a point of order in the literal and true sense of the word
i am referring to the disarray in parliament s calendars and agendas at least for this current year
on  april we had received a departmental note stipulating which days were holidays and which were not
i would kindly request a little attention and organisation in relation to annual planning
i would just like to say that i propose to raise this matter with the bureau this evening
so i hope we can raise this at the meeting of the bureau later today
thank you mrs banotti
we will have the same situation on whit monday
we will certainly have to keep a close eye on that
the report is to the spanish government on the visit to spain by the european committee at the end of 
the report is accessible via the internet as is the spanish government s response
they were both killed by a gunshot to the head
all seven defendants were absolved of charges of torture and belonging to an armed group
the sister of one of the victims told reporters that it was shameful that they were not convicted of torture
it is important to know about this matter
there is however a meeting of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market being held on that day
will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the parliament
thank you mr miller
the answer is yes the public will be allowed to attend the meeting
mr wiebenga has announced that this matter will be referred to the president and the bureau
my question to you is has the bureau looked into this matter yet
as you can see we have not let the grass grow under our feet
article  of that agreement establishes by common agreement the importance of respect for human rights and democratic principles
i should also add that the tunisian government has hindered the work of those journalists trying to cover this situation and has treated them intolerably
thank you mr baron crespo
we cannot continue to put up with a lame currency
i have also heard that this morning a commissioner attended the meeting of the committee on economic and monetary affairs
thank you mr ribeiro
as you will be aware we have tabled a debate on mr duisenberg s report for the next partsession in strasbourg
i think that this major debate will entirely meet your expectations
we must take account of the state of the european economy and also the possibilities created by the euro
madam president i agree wholeheartedly with mr baron crespo s lastbutone speech on tunisia
i therefore fail to see why you should append the position of one particular group to the letter
withdrawal of mr le pen s parliamentary mandate
thank you mrs palacio vallelersundi and thank you for having made yourself and your committee available to us
mr gollnisch pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order
i think that this does nevertheless merit one and a half minute s explanation
i think that you could allow me that much time
first of all i would like to refer to rule 
rule  incorporates the provisions covering the waiver of parliamentary immunity into our rules of procedure
you will see that it is a serious matter
this is what rule  states
the president cut the speaker off
mr gollnisch you have exceeded your allocated speaking time
you yourself said that you were asking for a minute and a half in which to make your point of order
mr le pen who will be heard tomorrow in the committee on legal affairs will explain the whole case and we will do things in complete accordance with the regulations
i really cannot let you speak any longer
it is quite out of the question
this is not the time to debate this matter mr gollnisch
madam president you have given the floor three times to mr baron crespo although these interventions were not tabled on the agenda
i ask you to give me a few seconds in which to finish what i have to say
mixed reactions
if you have any respect for your position and for the rights of members
i have the greatest respect for my position
you yourself said that you were requesting a minute and a half in order to make your point of order
that time is up
mr le pen will explain the entire matter to the committee on legal affairs tomorrow
review of the financial perspective
the next item is the statement by the commission on the review of the financial perspective
let me begin by taking this opportunity to inform you of another decision which the commission took today
mr levi formerly spokesman for the commission has been appointed director of the forward studies unit
the commission thanked mr carlo trojan sincerely for his activities
madam president i will now turn to the commission s decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective
that is why now is the time to safeguard this task from the financial viewpoint
the decisions the commission has taken today are a response to the requests made by parliament and the council
the financial plan in agenda  which was adopted in berlin already includes some eur  billion these resources were earmarked for bosniaherzegovina
i have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in parliament
at this point let me repeat that this measure does not mean undoing the agricultural policy package decided in berlin
and it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers
after all the current exchange rate value of the euro means very substantial savings for the european budget with regard to export financing
this is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come
the necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the tacis programme for the countries of the former soviet union
i think that will make the financial planning even more transparent
madam president i thank the commissioner for that report
there were not a great many surprises in it and to some extent i welcome that
a question remains however in relation to redeployment in category 
i heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines
can you give us some idea whether there will be any acrosstheboard reductions
last year the council proposed a  acrosstheboard cut in category 
is the commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any acrosstheboard cuts in category 
i am still unclear as to what happens from the year 
if you are taking money from category  for the next two years where do you expect that money to come from in 
i would regard that as the wrong approach
we have enough criteria according to which we can carefully assess to what extent we need to shift appropriations compared with agenda 
so these proposals are entirely justified and no acrosstheboard cuts are being proposed
madam president i was extremely interested and curious to hear what commissioner schreyer has just said
secondly the same applies to the cuts under heading 
you tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity
i think that this is a genuine problem
i will conclude with my third question
we had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the  budget discussions
in its proposal the commission has now allocated eur  billion for the period 
it is not therefore charging appropriations already disbursed for kosovo in 
however i would like to make one comment and then put a question to you
the fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in berlin
in fact these appropriations are urgently needed
mr graefe zu baringdorf i fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas
the only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture
so it is quite clear that the redeployment here is concentrated on foreign policy
in practice the commission proposal means redeploying eur  million from agriculture policy for the years  and 
the second point is the use of the flexibility reserve
in the event of a political change in serbia during  we could also resort to the flexibility reserve
regarding your question of when the documents will be available you will find them on the internet tomorrow morning
if i am not mistaken the total appropriations for serbia are eur  billion
this year s budget includes eur  million for the region as a whole
madam president commissioner i can be brief because in the end all the questions have been along the same lines
or must we always and on principle begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics
i would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers at the moment however that does not seem to be the case
this item is closed
vote
 nl mr president i can advise you how to vote on each of the four amendments
as such i would suggest voting against the amendments
thank you for that clarification
parliament adopted the resolution
explanations of vote
pesala report a
we cannot deny the commission the chance to intervene in such highly technical matters
the milk quota system was full of holes and we need a new one
maat report a

in april  the draft budget submitted by the european commission provided for a  reduction in that budget line
a proposal such as this represented a threat to the health of our children
this was unacceptable given that public health had been enshrined in the new title xiii of the treaty of amsterdam
furthermore it totally contradicted the conclusions of the agriculture council of  and  june 
this is the situation in 
for the future the european commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system
a maximum of  of subsidies for the provision of milk to schools would be financed by the european union with the member states remaining responsible for the other half
this is an unacceptable proposal
this is the only way to ensure that this system survives
i also welcome the decision to also include drinking yoghurt and milkbased beverages in the regulation


as you will be aware ec subsidies for supplying milk to schools were introduced as early as 
in  however the commission felt that it should put a stop to this programme
to date this system has provided for community financing equal to  of the target price of milk and in the report by the committee on agriculture and rural development the rapporteur proposes that this level of financing should be maintained rejecting the proposal of 
 sv we have voted against the maat report which concerns subsidies for the eu s school milk programme
however we do not think that it should be the job of the european union to subsidise school milk
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity school milk subsidies should be reduced to zero
we therefore view the commission s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction
since the s swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners
they have been able to do this without subsidies from the eu
europe is now facing a series of challenges requiring more money to be invested
there are several arguments for doing so
by nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support
but also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past
transeuropean networks  annual report
mr president ladies and gentlemen the eldr group supports the hatzidakis report
we too say yes to the brenner pass and we too say yes to the use of new technologies
however the original project did not set out a list of priorities a major shortcoming
the brenner pass covers a region that includes three countries and as such it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention
at present  million lorries cross the brenner pass every year
the growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase
good friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the brenner pass
it breaks new ground and can set an example to the european union
i believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen first let me congratulate the rapporteur mr hatzidakis on his very sound report
he proposes increasing the budget funding
according to commissioner schreyer today that will not be very easy to achieve
that is why we need this redeployment
some successes have been achieved especially in relation to the agreement with switzerland in other areas however we have been less successful
studies alone however are not enough
that is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment
we also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee
mr president firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur mr hatzidakis for his excellent report
the rapporteur has gone into the matter with great care and raised some very important issues
however i would like to underline a few issues
we also need a report on the effects of functional transport networks on a sustainable economy and employment
in addition the essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the union s funding for transport than was agreed
in the future greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects
in the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport
at the same time we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport
balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion
good communications are a vital necessity in these areas
mr president ladies and gentlemen we are agreed on one thing policy on transeuropean networks is in urgent need of reform
but two of these aims really are vital to the european union
one is the key aim of economic and social cohesion which holds the european union together
these tens were designed to prevent the drifting apart or the risk of a drift apart between poor and affluent regions
they have not done so
secondly it is still a mistake to think that the transeuropean networks help reduce mass unemployment
is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case
i also wonder whether the value of these projects has not been offset by the environmental destruction they cause
in fact they have achieved nothing
perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right
i think we really need to improve goods transport which must be facilitated by rail in order to be sustainable
we must revise the tens policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability
mr president the transeuropean networks are often hailed as one of the key successes of european integration
this is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable
they help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the eu member states
what effect does this have on the people in europe
perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term
nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being
similarly the major transport projects are not as promising as the annual report would like to suggest
for the northsouth highspeed link from berlin to verona only a few minor components have been constructed
the construction of the betuwe line through the netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial
economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success
all in all a good enough reason to abandon the betuwe line project
there is still far too little broadbased social debate on the priorities set and choices made
clearly it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these tens
the commission will shortly undertake a revision of the ten guidelines
a package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network
this particularly applies to this southern axis which would make paris only three and a half hours distant from milan
like the rapporteur i am disturbed about this
one of these projects is the extension of the northsouth link and in particular the brenner baselevel tunnel
this is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population
moreover this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the union as a whole
unfortunately however there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation
this means that more than five years after essen there are still no concrete plans on the table
the people of the region cannot understand that
for it is they who have to live with the evergrowing avalanche of traffic
in the end that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity
if that was such a terrible thing the greens should have opposed it at the time
they did not do so
let me just mention two projects that have been successful
i think that from the environmental standpoint the rail link across the oresund was precisely the right thing to do
we want railways and we want links with remote regions
the new angloirish rail links are of great benefit to the environment and the region
our committee proposes a foursided agreement between the three states concerned and the union
the environmental situation in the alps is particularly problematic
quite simply the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground
something therefore needs to be done in this regard
above all we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other
the italians say they will start building when the austrians build
the germans say they will begin building once the austrians are building
the austrians say they will start to build once the germans and the italians begin
let me make two final comments
madam vicepresident of the commission take your time with the revision of the transeuropean networks
first you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today s debate
we do not want more show projects  or  show projects with no guaranteed financing
for the citizens will lose confidence in us if we declare certain projects to be priorities and then do not execute them
we must remind the member states that they have committed themselves to guaranteeing the financing committed themselves to executing the plan
we should indeed accord transeuropean networks the real importance which they deserve
we should ensure that the financial resources spent on tens are increased
we should see to it that we overcome any hurdles that are holding up  of the  essen projects and leaving us exposed
the concentration of road airport and port networks is causing serious congestion and environmental problems which we must prevent
but apart from the simple budgetary and financial considerations in more general terms it is the commission s general guidelines in this area that are worthy of criticism
we cannot however accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed
are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations
have they been devised in association or in consultation or is the rationale of the transeuropean networks as the report implies only based on the free market
the most negative aspect however seems to be the financing
it is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased which is a moot point
this approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service
clearly if private operators are involved in the financing they will aim for maximum profit
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen first let me thank our rapporteur very warmly for his report
alpine transit must be looked at and understood as an overall problem
certainly austria france and the neighbouring states are affected most
moreover the inntal in austria is one of the most densely populated regions
alpine transit is an integral problem which needs to be addressed in integral terms
we cannot look separately at brenner toll roads and alpine transit
what we need is crossfinancing
i would consider the transport costs directive an appropriate legal basis
i think that would give us sound financing
i call for publicprivate partnerships for i think working together is the best way to succeed
we have a massive problem with northsouth transit
i am against further studies of the brenner pass for we already have enough of them as it is
transport by rail at least to the south of the brenner is not operating and the international link is not operating either
that is why i have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 
perhaps we do not need another study but we should weigh things up properly and select the best project
i have put one of these projects before the transport committee
there are few better or equally good ones
the participation of private capital will necessarily result in a quest for profit to the detriment both of users and of those who work in the sector
this has resulted in falling standards in rail transport as a whole as well as staff reductions which has contributed to keeping unemployment levels high
i would be most grateful to you commissioner if today you could allay my concerns
mr president growth and employment in europe depend to a large degree upon exploiting european infrastructure effectively
we should therefore have already set in motion the ten projects that have still to get off the ground
however i am a little put out that german politicians are rather less enthusiastic
building a permanent link between germany and denmark will create many new and muchneeded jobs in the area
there are almost always people who automatically say no to anything new
anything which brings about change is a little frightening whether it be emu the euro environmentalism or a bridge
one should not however be afraid of something good
a link across the fehmarn belt is an exciting rather than a frightening project
improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order
today s report nonetheless raises a number of questions about how we are actually to follow up our various decisions
a few of these ten projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe
i am more doubtful however where a number of the other projects are concerned
as quite a number of people here have said many of these projects are being developed awfully slowly
the rapporteur who by the way has done a quite excellent job has expressed his concern about this
it is indeed very worrying when these ventures are not taken seriously
let me give an example of this
this is something which the countries concerned have undertaken to carry out but it is a terribly slow process
i should therefore like here today to ask the commission s representative a number of questions
when does the commission think that the nordic triangle and the other ten projects will be complete
what is the commission actually doing to make sure that they are in fact completed
i believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the commission will produce
i believe that as well as analysing the situation the most important thing is to look to the future
accordingly i will take this opportunity to make some observations on behalf of the commission
therefore we can only provide the information which is available to us and make analyses based on that data
you say that some projects are being delayed
in this regard i would like to say that the target date is 
there is therefore still time to implement them within the time limit
furthermore some of the projects present great technical difficulties
i will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talkedabout projects the brenner baselevel tunnel
that tunnel is a symbolic project as far as the european union s technological capacities and its ability to act are concerned
this is also true in the case of the brenner
i want to make this very clear
we are talking about very faroff dates but this does not mean that there is no will
on the contrary there is an absolute will
furthermore i would like to point out that the level of funding in terms of the total appropriations for the  principal ten projects has been 
that was the percentage which you the parliament considered appropriate in your most recent resolutions
it is midway between your initial proposal and the council s proposal
that programme will cover the period 
we are about to review the guidelines on the transeuropean transport networks
i will be presenting this review report and an initial proposal shortly
therefore the remote regions the extremely remote regions and the least developed regions must be at the heart of community action
however resolving bottlenecks does not harm the remote regions i would like to give one very clear example the bottleneck on the railway in bordeaux
does this affect france yes of course it affects southwest france but only to a degree
so when we clear a bottleneck in bordeaux we are in fact benefiting the development of an area of the iberian peninsula
mr president lastly i would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic
this aspect will also be included as a key element in the review of the transeuropean networks
thank you commissioner de palacio
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
european airline industry
that is the key question approximately ten years on from the start of liberalisation within that sector
all these aspects demonstrate that liberalisation has stirred the market
we could say that passengers have generally benefited from liberalisation but not all of them
for example it is evident that the benefits in business class are only minor compared to those in other passenger categories
in your communication you stated that fragmentation is still far more pronounced here than it is in the united states
you also stated in your communication that the profitability of our companies is considerably less than that of our american counterparts
also how tenable and sustainable is the growth we have witnessed within this sector over the past decade
we are faced with an overcrowded airspace or should i say a badly managed airspace
i think this is a matter of life and death especially for small companies starting out in the aviation industry
we have also asked ourselves about social development and the rights of passengers
this is why i wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on gibraltar on this matter
is that in any way related to aviation
these are questions which we are still left with
important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation
firstly air traffic control should of course be europeanised
this was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups
it is clear that another aspect namely safety should also be europeanised
a european aviation safety authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency
it is obvious that the member states need to take a step back as far as these two aspects are concerned
this of course determines the entire structure of the aviation industry in europe
normally speaking after a liberalisation process companies tend to operate in tune with the market which has been liberalised
this is actually quite rare in the world of aviation
no mergers have taken place
this is why i as rapporteur have a few questions with regard to your proposal to establish this common transatlantic air space
a number of very complex problems need to be solved first before we can take the second step
an important question is what do we do if we cannot pull it off with the americans
what do we do then on our own
how viable is the european industry if it is confined to the european boundaries and to those bilateral agreements
secondly intermodality is highlighted in my report too
trains and planes could work together very well in a number of areas
at all events mr president i would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been hugely important
i am well aware of this although we are not even halfway there
as such we need to get a move on otherwise we will be buried under an avalanche
aviation is without doubt one of the most exciting and stimulating industries
but today with the liberalisation of the market flying for most people has become a way of life
i also welcome the commission statement that subsidies have now ceased
this has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this
i fully accept that there are challenges which need to be addressed such as problems with congestion in particular air traffic control
as a result we now have substantially more competition
we are a long way from having a uniform common european air transport market in principle
i think in future we will have to deal with four important points
mr sterckx has already addressed some of them and i would like to raise them again
secondly let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport
it enhances individual mobility
but on the other hand we must not disregard environmental conditions
my position is fairly clear on this point
mr president i would like to congratulate mr sterckx on his report
it is the first in a series of reports on aviation which we will be dealing with in the course of this year
we support the development of a european aviation space encompassing all aspects of aviation ranging from delays to environmental harm
in addition we think that at world level the union must be able to show a united front on this matter
i would like to illustrate this with air traffic control for example
we would also draw attention to the human side of developments within aviation
this is dominated by three issues firstly safety
our amendment on widening the scope in this way has been adopted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism
common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels
this should not be restricted to the eu
we can and must help improve safety agreements throughout europe
one is led to believe that lower costs as a result of liberalisation only have benefits
personnel too experience the adverse social effects of cost reductions
finally air fares may seem low but often the overall interests of the passengers are hardly taken into consideration
it is no fun having to wait for hours because of a delay on top of which you are likely to miss your connecting flight
it is even less fun if you become the victim of overbooking
a fat lot of good that will do them
passengers have rights and more than anything they have the right to be informed at the time when a problem arises
as i understand it airports will be installing notice boards this summer on which they will display passenger rights in the event of delays for example
this is a step in the right direction
it would be better still if the amendment on passengers right to information tabled by the group of the party of european socialists were to be adopted in addition
we are always harping on about consumer interests well here is one
let us recall that the title of this communication is from single market to worldwide challenges 
of all the many words in this communication just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue
it is quite obvious that aviation s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness some positive and some negative
let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment
it makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years
i would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming
mr sterckx has included environment in this own report
i very much welcome that but i would also like to see environment automatically mainstreamed through all commission reports and communications
there was ground congestion and new infrastructure was very expensive but anything was still possible in the air
meanwhile the countries at the heart of the european union have been faced with unexpected problems
thanks to free competition record low prices and cheap taxfree fuel the airspace has become overcrowded there
these airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings
the air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect
we have reached the limits of growth
this is why the proportion of international train traffic and freight transport by river and canal has dropped so dramatically
there are considerably fewer international through train connections within the european union compared to  years ago
in the remote areas of the european union however it seems as if time has stood still there
people still complain there that remote regions and islands are not sufficiently serviced
new small airports are expected to perform miracles as they could attract rich business people and masses of tourists
it is high time that the safety and health of passengers personnel and population on the ground were made the top priority
my group is very much in favour of the second opinion relating to the environment safety and the interests of personnel
air traffic cannot continue to grow endlessly and we cannot afford to subordinate all kinds of other matters to this
mr president the sterckx report is excellent and develops a point of great relevance in great depth
for example even today an italian pilot with professional qualifications obtained in italy cannot do the same job in belgium
another issue to be resolved is the age limit
i therefore call upon the commission to adopt common legislation governing the whole of the union as soon as possible
mr president aviation is undergoing turbulent times
the report drafted by mr sterckx elaborates on the effects of strong growth within the sector
the enormous competition within the industry has led to a price war in certain sectors
the number of passengers and alongside this the number of flights is growing at an alarming rate
the rapporteur is looking for the solution to congestion in a common airspace and european air traffic control i support him in this
competition also leads to lower costs
the pressure on personnel in the sector is increasing both socially and financially
it is vital to guarantee their rights
i endorse the rapporteur s observations that proposals are required which deal with the social dimension
passengers also suffer as a result of the commercial war
this too needs to be regulated
the impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance
and this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future
it is therefore necessary to consider the position which we want to and must accord aviation
this report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market
in short the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather
it is up to us to guide it through this in the interests of society
in our opinion the rapporteur is steering things in the right direction
i shall begin with the medium term
in the medium term we must transfer regulative competencies for air traffic control to the european union something that is entirely feasible
there is no point in people coming along and saying well eurocontrol has far more members and is far better
eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven
one reason is that it operates according to the unanimity principle and the principle of the lowest common denominator
i think the european economic area sets a good example
we also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations
i admit that mr sterckx would like to see the term privatisation replaced with liberalisation 
i think we will be happy to endorse that
but we need competition and of course he agrees with us on that
we must go further in this regard in any case we will be discussing this again in connection with the atkins report
i now turn to the shortterm aspects
we are all grateful to the vicepresident for setting up a highlevel working party with a view to achieving results in the short term too
there are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector
another result of liberalisation has been the practice of cosharing of airline alliances and in some instances even takeovers
at my own airport in manchester there are icelandicregistered aircraft and i have been to iceland more times than they have
the reason why i mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument
we accept that an increasing number of eu citizens are demanding better services
we believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations
then of course there is the get them on board scenario irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not
the rapporteur also mentions as an unresolved issue the continued state presence in certain cases in the ownership of national airlines
turning to the sterckx report our contribution has concentrated on the environmental aspects related to it
i would finally like to mention some basic points
and maybe it will
on the contrary the situation will deteriorate
greece is a typical example
these are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report
we would like to have further information particularly regarding the formation of this authority and we would like to know who would be responsible for monitoring it and by what means they would do so
furthermore paragraph  calls for and i quote the operational bodies responsible for atc to be privatised 
we do not think that this is a wise suggestion
this privatisation will result in major job losses and will certainly have a damaging impact on safety
european skies are comparatively safe and we want to see that safety preserved
to conclude in order to guarantee the primacy of safety regulations over all other considerations air traffic control must remain a public and national service
mr president i would first of all like to extend my sincere congratulations to mr sterckx on his excellent report
one could therefore say that there is a lot of commotion in the industry and this makes the report all the more topical
liberalisation without a common aviation policy and without a unified airspace will inevitably lead to problems
it is estimated that air traffic will double in the next fifteen years
at present one in three flights is delayed and   flight hours are lost annually and unless farreaching measures are taken the situation will only get worse
we have a unified market free movement of people and a single currency
why can we not move towards a single european airspace more rapidly
this is most certainly a lesson we need to learn from the vicissitudes of the hushkits affair
in addition the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports
this is often the case and is most needed at smaller regional airports
in summary and by way of conclusion i would like to advocate a pax avianautica
personally for several reasons i feel that the tone of the report is excessively smug with regard to the liberalisation that has already taken place
i feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored
this is extremely important
airports are highly decisive factors in influencing the location of businesses senior officials management and therefore jobs to an area
i feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account
this gives an idea of how competition has increased over these years
the opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways
the opposite situation may undoubtedly suit the united states but in no way does it suit european airlines and european interests
i must point out ladies and gentlemen that the reality of the internal civil aviation market in europe has been affected in a very negative way by this
on the contrary more jobs and wealth are being created
i would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised
in this regard therefore the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the union
we will make a proposal to the effect that slot allocation should be an administrative right granted under licence
we will try to ensure that there is greater flexibility in this allocation without causing any companies to go bankrupt
we must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised
the question of noise is also a serious problem
the commission does not hold any position in principle with regard to whether or not operational air traffic services should be privatised
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
appointment of senior commission officials
i would remind you that the vote on this matter will take place on  may 
we should bear in mind that the appointments policy provides motivation in some cases and not in others
it is therefore very important that we try to see that good intentions are accompanied by good practices
there are clear imbalances
to give another example it cannot be put down to merit that there are  a or a spaniards and  belgian ones
it is important that in a procedure which needs to be transparent merit is easily explicable and comprehensible
it is also important that there is success in the search for equality between the sexes
i am grateful to the socialist spokesperson who knows my wife for agreeing with me
it is important that we fulfil the commitment to double the number of female appointments
we will closely monitor this appointments policy which must be open and decisive
we are happy to accept the new appointments within the commission in particular that of the secretarygeneral
at least that is what i think
mr president could i begin by thanking the honourable member for his question
i substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made
in fact i would only diverge on one point
he may be right that behind every great woman is a great man  there is a debate about that
what i am certain is true is that behind every great man is a very very surprised motherinlaw
in this oral answer therefore i will summarise the situation relating to senior appointments as at last thursday  april
since the present commission took office six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade a
they related to three officials of german nationality two of italian nationality and one of irish nationality
in the same period  appointments involving promotion to grade a have been made
eleven transfers at director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made
in summary therefore a total of  promotions to senior appointments have been made since this commission took office
six of the officials are italian nationals five are german five are british three belgian two irish one dutch one french one austrian and one spanish
these figures are accurate as of  april 
as a result a stillphotograph of the staff profile at any fixed time does not and cannot give a complete picture
those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than a generalised code of conduct
copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable member and they are available on the internet
the commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counterproductive rigidity and also because it would breach staff regulations
the commissioner responsible for personnel then formally proposes to the college the candidate who has been agreed upon with the portfolio commissioner and with the president of the commission
in the case of appointments of directors the agreement of the relevant directorgeneral must also be obtained
i apologise for the length of time i have taken up but naturally i wanted to give the house the most comprehensive information
i would like to thank him very much for the very comprehensive and open response that he has given to that question
today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation
clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint
can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be openminded and looking at these new solutions
it would not be surprising given the changes that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this
mr president i too would like to thank the commissioner for his reply
it is clear from the current debate that the european parliament has asked the commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea
we have also asked to deflag senior posts
i would actually like to return to the very root cause of this discussion
it has all gone quiet now all we have now is a number of very innocent factual issues
this very exciting and very extensive change is something both the commission and parliament want but the ball is now back in the commission s court
we have precise data
the commission has to come up with proposals on these points
are we not up to speed or is there something up with the commission
should this be seen as an attack on the commission
those seemed to be the undertones for a fleeting moment
our friends from the european people s party have thrown us into a bit of confusion because we are fully agreed on the key points
the rotation system is clear
neither have i heard that anything is wrong with the performance quite the opposite in fact
i am speaking up today as a dutch national
despite this i do not think we should operate at national level but should cover a wider level
surely this position could not be any clearer
what should we make of it
in our opinion we really need new standards
this is what we asked the commission for
the commission was willing to produce these new standards
what you cannot do is judge the individuals who are not yet bound by these standards
if you ask me you would be shooting the commission in the foot and in my opinion you would be shooting yourself in the foot more so than the commission and this is not helpful
in short we are giving our wholehearted support to reform and we hope from the bottom of our hearts that the deadline is met
that is a mammoth task
it is our task to give each other very critical guidance and to ensure that reform is brought about
as i understand it the salto mortale of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats could be interpreted as a declaration of support
in my opinion we would then be far removed from the efficiency required by the commission
we continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy
first and foremost appointments must be based on the candidate s merits
this is how it was described in your document and i think that this clause should be retained
it is clear that we continue to support this
on behalf of my group i would say that this question was somewhat superfluous
this is the question we need to ask ourselves
whether the person involved is dutch or of any other nationality is of little relevance in the great scheme of things
what i do like commissioner is that you in your information provide evidence of a transparent policy
i also welcome the fact that based on your information it appears that there are no major imbalances
i feel this should be acknowledged
we must realise this
vicepresident kinnock there is a strange atmosphere in this chamber
i supported the submission of the question
let us forget the figures for a moment and focus on the functions
this is what is to be inferred from a careful examination which is not merely concerned with numbers
i feel that this is also a question which although it does not form part of our question for an oral answer would merit a debate at another time in its own right
personally i feel very strongly that there is a need for this
mr president first of all mr dell alba is certainly right with the first part of his question
the tone of the question when it was put seems very different from the tone that we are hearing now in the chamber
first of all we have to say that the white paper reforms are progressing
they are progressing slowly but rome was not built in a day and we must remember that
we all know that there is a timetable  one that we have all agreed to and must be kept
what i would like to address before i look at the substance is the question behind this question  that is what we really have to look at here
we are all desperate to see reform but it will take time
the new commission has been in office for only seven months
it was approved by the european parliament by a huge majority
and the ppe group is being hijacked by that element within the group
but there is a time and place for that and this will be when we look at mr pomes ruiz response to the white paper
as the commissioner said you cannot take a snapshot halfway through
we should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals
the role of the european parliament is to keep the commission on its toes
mrs hautala s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that
we do not currently think that the proposals go far enough in terms of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities
that is a serious problem
the fact is that commission reform is going ahead
mr prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation
that is a post that we would like to have seen advertised
finally i would like to ask the ppe group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here
thank you very much mrs morgan
more often than not it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts
who in the end is to evaluate the shortlist that has been mentioned
more often than not it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation
perhaps i could risk some superficiality because of the time by trying to answer the specific questions raised
i will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress
i would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive
secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every directorategeneral
most have submitted theirs
as mr harbour says the role and activity of the secretarygeneral in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial
we are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training evaluation and the appointment system
i presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked
i can only say that i welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information
i think that also responds to the point raised by mrs morgan on that subject
the question was also raised of women s appointments
of the  very senior appointments that have been made by this commission since last september  have been of women officials
that to me is modest
mrs hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect
in the course of the rest of the year i can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained
i hope that is of some reassurance to mr dell alba
mrs morgan inevitably asks from the wilds of wales why were there not any welsh people
i can only ask honourable members to wait until the physical evidence is available
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on wednesday  may 
legal aspects of electronic commerce
i have to say that this attitude has also been adopted by the various political groups
the directive is also  as i have already said  a great example of interinstitutional cooperation
this directive is a magnificent example of teamwork by parliament the commission and the council
we must also understand that this directive is a priority in terms of guaranteeing the development of electronic commerce
all of these elements are community assets as far as the competitiveness of european companies is concerned
for this reason mr president i believe that tomorrow this parliament will be worthy of congratulation and this congratulation can also be extended to the other community institutions
european legislative procedures happen to be particularly complex and the market is simply developing at a faster pace
by way of example let me just take the debate on the country of origin principle or alternatively the country of destination principle
so i must admit that i am not entirely satisfied with all the points of the common position before us
i still have criticisms about many of them
let me just give you as an instance the forthcoming harmonisation of civil law
here the commission has already given the appropriate instructions
the tampere council called for reports and voted on them
here i am thinking above all of the interpretation of article  which is still worded in a very ambivalent way
i think we can also describe the rules that we adopted on provider liability as generous
we also need to make more rapid progress in setting up outofcourt settlement procedures and the small claims procedure
mr president the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic
no amendments
i congratulate heartily our rapporteur on her original strategy and i hope what will be her achievement of obtaining continuing consensus
yet it was a carefully considered decision
speed with certainty in this fastmoving new world is essential
that is a good balance
we must continually be aware that the web is not limited to europe
it is of course global
european business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence
we have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of ebusinesses in europe
we should also take care to provide coherent legislation
confidence is essential
there are many opportunities but what of the threats
this may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the web
one bad news story may blow confidence in etrade for years
ecommerce is in its early stages
we need as legislators to be watchful not necessarily interventionist but wary of implications as the medium grows
our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis
the eldr group will stick to her original noamendment line
i have some sympathy with commissioner bolkestein here today
is this we ask ourselves the death of ideology
i suppose we could excuse ourselves with the thought that we are debating more with the medium here than the message
that is important and i hope that the commission will be taking that on board
in these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on ecommerce
so let us be sure that we carry the directive but do not forget the other problems
it is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation
i would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation
all of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive
so essentially this is the core principle
that essentially is what we have here
clearly the internet world is going to be highly suitable for the commission to set that up
we want to know about issues where member governments have blocked transactions
we want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts
we want to know where consumers have had problems and feel that their rights are not protected
all of those i suggest need to be covered by the feedback
the final point i want to make is about speed
mrs palacio referred in her introduction to internet years and the speed of approach
we were challenged by the commission and by the council to get this directive through as quickly as possible
mr president can i too add my congratulations to the rapporteur
there can be no doubt that the job of the parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously
it is therefore a balanced proposal
this therefore means we need to create a clear and simple predictable and consistent legal framework for electronic commerce
it is now an economic and political imperative
i therefore strongly recommend that parliament endorses and adopts mrs palacio s report which represents a common position
we do this in the full knowledge that the eeconomy is evolving at a rapid pace
we are witnessing in the st century the equivalent of the industrial revolution
that means as policymakers and institutions we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain
in particular this is the case given the global nature of ecommerce
we have in this directive an article which allows us to do that
i would warn against complacency
the legal framework of the internal market plays a crucial role in this
these uncertainties have been there for far too long because the council needed nearly a year to determine its positions
similarly the copyright directive has been with the council since february  ie for over a year now
parliament works significantly faster
the country of origin principle is one of the internal market s cornerstones
it is therefore obvious that this should be extended to crossborder ecommerce
one cause for concern in this respect however is that this principle will only apply to trade between businesses for the time being
revisions of private international law for the benefit of online trade with consumers are in the pipeline
i would therefore call on the commission to support initiatives to this effect
how does the commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers
i would like a reply to this question
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work
i was not one of those who agreed with the consensus in committee about the tabling of no amendments
without consumer confidence ecommerce is going nowhere
this is fundamental horizontal legislation that is going to be dealing with the whole internet and its commercial viability
there has already been reference here tonight to the need for revision
even before we adopt the directive we are talking about revision and i think that is very wise
i would like finally to thank again the rapporteur for taking on board the serious concerns that we expressed in committee
the absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development
all these areas will have to evolve and in many cases change completely
a malicious thought has come to me what will become of the petty national protectionist behaviour which we have witnessed in recent years
now at this time of revolution a large number of issues dear to the european people s party must be reassessed
this potential for growth is our challenge for the future
the development of information technology provides new opportunities to communicate and to disseminate information simply and cheaply
the basis of a democracy must be that freedom of expression should be protected not restricted
communication using computers should be viewed in the same way as any medium of communication
that would be as absurd as making a cafe owner liable for monitoring what is said across the cafe tables
is there anyone who wants to see a utilitarian nanny state
i do not think so
i therefore also support amendment no  which i think is extremely important and deals precisely with this issue
freedom with responsibility ought to be the motto for continued work on developing this area
mr president ladies and gentlemen i too want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report and her strategy
i welcome her recommendation that we should not suggest any amendments to the common position
all current surveys show the great economic potential of electronic business
the previous speakers have already described that in graphic terms so i need not go into the subject or this aspect of it again
europe continues to trail behind the usa in ebusiness
yet we have a real chance to catch up
europe is presently seeing a wave of internet companies being set up
we must give political support to this trend
we must also encourage stronger competition on the local telephone markets to make internet connection cheaper
many thanks
i think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well
furthermore ebusiness will be encouraged tomorrow when we adopt a legal framework for electronic commerce in the european union
that will send out a clear signal
i believe it is also a good signal in terms of attracting foreign investment
here the regulation provides that what is known as the principle of the country of origin should apply
that saves him a considerable financial outlay in these transactions
however it also creates a new situation to which industry and national legislators will have to adjust
that is why we need changes to the law and more farreaching harmonisation in some respects
in germany for example we may well have to abolish the law on discounts and the regulations on free gifts
i am glad the directive also contains a review clause
i would ask the commission to take that very seriously
indeed as mrs wallis said you must remember it is not only within europe
it is actually a global industry and it is around the world that we want to see a proper framework established
it is one of the interesting characteristics of the community system of legislation that it is relatively easy to bring forward amending legislation
this can be done quickly if necessary as mr lehne pointed out
so there is no reason to delay
speed on this occasion is of the essence
professor maccormick said that there seems to be a very great deal of agreement about the need to go forward without amending this proposal
of course it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible
however i would like to make certain observations which may be useful in this second phase which is so necessary
we should not forget that the internet is international
the electronic market is a prime market in terms of growth employment and future prospects and not just in europe
the rapporteur analyses the common position in the spirit of constructive criticism
my second point concerns cultural assets
i think that is not good enough
i ask the commission to devote special attention to these two points
it seemed it was the representatives of our political group that were going at such a rate and i did not notice
i am a little out of breath
hopefully however it will not have an effect on the matter in hand
as so many have already said the matter is urgent and i agree
the directive in hand is immensely important as regards the competitiveness of the eu
it is pointless to deny that a veritable race is going on between the various continents in the area of electronic commerce
there is competition with regard to speed and innovation
new jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced
on the other hand parliament will not solve the challenges of ecommerce by intervening itself in a big way or through regulation
wisdom is not always a characteristic of politicians be they in the commission the council or in this chamber
too much regulation will freeze commerce over the internet and prevent it from adapting to new circumstances and technical developments
to derive maximum benefit from ecommerce we have to ensure there is real competition in the telecommunications networks
if we just sit here talking about details we will not manage to lay down even elementary uptodate standards for electronic commerce
how do we imagine we will be prepared for the next stage mcommerce or wireless commerce if we cannot meet the demands of ecommerce
that is why i support the previous speakers regarding the adoption of the common position with no amendments
mrs palacio has spoken about a milestone in the development of the european union
i would like to thank those members of this house who in turn have thanked the commission for the work it has done
once again this is something which my staff will greatly appreciate and i am grateful to the members for their comments
this is legislation which will offer legal certainty to industry and the consumer
rapid approval of this directive is vital in order to attain this goal
in fact heads of government stressed this recently at the lisbon summit as was pointed out by mrs mccarthy among others
many in this house especially the rapporteur mrs palacio have emphasised this aspect for the benefit of small and mediumsized businesses
furthermore the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved
this has also been acknowledged by various meps
mrs wallis spoke of the right balance that has been struck and this was echoed by mrs mccarthy
some members are left feeling not completely satisfied
this is understandable
this is of course true
as i said i understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck
the french language captures this sentiment rather beautifully with the expression on ne peut pas contenter tout le monde et sa bellemere you can t please all of the people all of the time
parliament has not tabled any amendments and has thus paved the way for a swift approval
this is a wise and much appreciated decision taken by all major political groups
i too would like to express my appreciation for this
parliament has been extremely sensible if i may say so
those amendments have been incorporated in the commission s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position
this has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the commission is grateful for this
in other words the common position fully reflects the support which parliament has given to the internal market approach at first reading
in my opinion further consultation is necessary in order to find out how we can improve this approach in future
i would like to say a few words regarding the specific questions which have been raised by members of your house
first of all i would like to address a comment made by mr harbour regarding feedback
with regard to this review mr lehne expressed the hope that it will take place under the mandate of this commission
the portuguese presidency will make every effort to reach a common position during that internal market council
finally i would like to address a comment from mr karas he has spoken about the trade in pharmaceutics
distance selling particularly of pharmaceutics is greatly restricted or even banned in certain member states
those restrictions also apply to selling via the internet
the risk is there
this concludes the remarks which i would like to make on behalf of the commission at the end of this debate
thank you very much commissioner
i feel i must thank you on behalf of the house for your exhaustive response to the debate
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
food aid 
day after day over the last few weeks we have seen pictures of the dreadful famine in ethiopia all over the media
this afternoon in response to precisely that situation the european parliament adopted a resolution on the famine in ethiopia
but let me add a few general comments
a binding strategy for closer coordination between the donor countries will help ensure that the aid really is effective
food aid consignments should gradually be replaced by measures to improve food security in these countries
thirdly it is extremely important in food policy to take account of the repercussions on local food production and markets
naturally the findings will have to be incorporated in our future activities otherwise the evaluation would presumably be pointless
my fifth point is that we must be extremely careful to ensure that the aid actually reaches the target groups who are genuinely in need
allow me to mention another point namely the problem of food aid on the basis of credit
instead we should increase still further the share of food aid in the form of grants
in that context let me also say that i fully and wholeheartedly support the amendment mr fiori tabled for the plenary
to finish a word about the forthcoming wto talks
mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs schierhuber you have already mentioned the resolution on ethiopia
well it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is even today
as such we can hardly deny this food aid convention review our approval
in this way local food production is often thrown off balance and deeply discouraged
the convention is used as a lubricant for commercial transactions and often clashes with social and cultural traditions
these rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement
in my view the intention to promote local agricultural development is vital
despite this there is still a blemish on the new convention
the european negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 
but what is  years in the life of a nation

the commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the budgets committee in that there is no complete financial statement
i am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land
this is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future
water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries
it is also good news that the new convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs
the extension of the convention and the new rules that have been introduced must therefore be warmly welcomed
mr president i also wish to congratulate the rapporteur
internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not in my view properly understood
there is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies
this is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the renegotiated convention
that is very important indeed
clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way
we need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency
we need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have identified them
we also need to monitor all foodstocks that are held in the world both public foodstocks and private foodstocks
this would represent very real progress in the attempts that we make to tackle food security
mr president this convention will only be successful if in time it becomes redundant
needless to say structural food aid will continue to be necessary as long as we have so many seriously undernourished people
the fiori amendment is preoccupied with europe s own interests and is therefore wide of the mark
in fact it promotes exactly the opposite of what is really needed namely a strategy which leads to selfsufficiency
another implication of a correct strategy is that soft loans would not be linked to compulsory purchases in the donor country
moreover the permitted  credit is not really of any benefit because it can lead to unfair competition
despite what has been agreed food aid must remain restricted to financial aid and a range of real food
as such vitamin tablets from canada do not form part of this
does the commission think that this is feasible and could aid not be allocated via one development budget line
our aim should not be to fill the purses of a few but to fill the mouths of many
only when we manage to achieve this will aid no longer be necessary
mr president i strongly support mrs schierhuber s report on food aid
one euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future
that is feasible in any case
how will future generations judge us i ask myself
the report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty
for reasons of time i cannot go into them in detail
but the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here
the main part of the report correctly makes reference to the fact that its aim ultimately should be to make food aid unnecessary
we hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants
if we take that approach then i am convinced we really can combat poverty
first of all i wish to condemn the derisory extent of this aid compared to what is actually needed
it is not charity then that africa needs
africa will then be in a position to develop its agriculture to a level where it can produce the food to feed its people properly
of course i am not naive enough to think that one decent resolution passed in the european parliament will be enough to guarantee this
however i cannot miss this opportunity to touch on an aspect a principle which i feel is of paramount importance precisely to our fellow citizens
in my opinion the correct weighting should be given to european production
europe has always been one of the highestproducing continents in the agricultural sector
for example the european union is one of the world s largest producers of starchy products which are essential for nutrition
and that is why the commission requested extending the period of validity of that convention until  june 
the new convention attaches special importance to the following points
firstly more consideration is to be given to local nutritional customs
secondly the donor countries can now express their commitments in tonnage value or a combination of tonnage and value
more than half the relevant commission resources will go to such transactions
my fifth point is that food aid to the least developed countries will be given purely in the form of grants
overall food aid provided in the form of grants will represent not less than  of a member s contributions and members will strive to raise this percentage even higher
our position is as follows food aid must be clearly separated from commercial transactions
the commission and the community are in a position to mobilise   tonnes of cereals between april  and march  ie immediately this year
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
aid to uprooted people in asia and latin america
mr president i am indeed privileged today to present this report to parliament
it is one of the first reports from the development committee under the codecision procedure
all are waiting with bated breadth to hear my speech
this is a very urgent matter
the extension we propose is for one year until  december 
the extension of the regulation will enable a further eur  million to be spent until the end of this year
between  and  parliament sanctioned eur  million
this regulation came to an end on  december 
the european parliament s original report on the current regulation the howitt report was exemplary in how it was constructed by parliament
in addition and more importantly more than fifty ngos were consulted
therefore the parliament played a major role in producing this regulation with its report
the unhcr estimates that there are  million in asia and some   in latin america
in afghanistan about  million people were assisted by the mineclearance programme which is crucial in returning that country back to normality
therefore in a sense an immediate approval of the proposal would postpone the need for a longterm solution
in doing so it would nevertheless allow the institutions to engage in a more thorough dialogue in this area and hopefully allow us to find a more permanent solution by 
this is also a very timely report in the context of asylumseekers
we are now presented with a solution by this parliament by our institutions in europe where we want to and can help people where the problem is
the need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago
or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from burma
on this regulation we know that the council has some divided thinking
i have to say mr patten i regret that the commission does too
you know that i have spent much time visiting and studying the problems of violent armed conflict in colombia
it is a disgrace that with this regulation the european commission in the past has failed to address this problem
it is the usual way things are debated in parliaments
a report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation
it is four months since it expired
but how can we do this without the necessary reports at our disposal
also the fact that the amounts spent are disproportionate to the number of displaced persons raises questions
we hope that the report and indepth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming
little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme
sound annual evaluation reports are lacking
moreover we are still waiting for a longterm vision for this programme
parliament must use this as a way of forcing the commission to account for the spending of the development funds
none of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with
the european union must help where it can
the role of the national member states however is at least as important
the most important prerequisite to a longterm solution for the problems outlined is sound coordination of member state efforts
nothing more nothing less
this being the purpose of this report i congratulate its rapporteur mr deva
to help those in need when it is in our hands to do so at the end of the day results in our really helping ourselves
the bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish
the other side of the coin is also true
hoarding does impoverish
the fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children
this makes it even more imperative that action should be taken
food supplies water and sanitation housing and shelter education are of course the top priorities
i welcome the recognition of this
it is essential that annual reports are submitted by the commission to this parliament and to the council as is specified
if such reports are not forthcoming then i could not find my vote to go with this renewal
i believe that the commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do
the financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to
these provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary
where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good healthy and proper debate
mr president the commission proposes that the existing regulation be extended
however the programme must not be halted under any circumstances that would be quite wrong
it is important that the programme should be extended but not before we have seen the evaluations
the commission promised that we would have the evaluations in march then in april and then in may so where have they got to
an independent evaluation is needed for otherwise we have no guarantees that the money has been spent properly
the purpose of the evaluation is of course to improve the future programmes
it is this directorategeneral which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility
the court of auditors has also criticised the lack of clarity in the way the different initiatives are related to one other
it is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence
without this amendment the commission could get away with not having submitted a single evaluation report since the regulation came into force in 
i have also noted that my dear friend mr dell alba has had his grumbles printed as an appendix to my opinion
however he is only speaking for himself
at any rate he had no backing in the committee since he was the only one to vote against the conclusions
a number of honourable members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation
i also noted what the honourable gentleman dr paisley said about our moral duties to those who are uprooted
the commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in spring 
however these discussions were delayed by the former commission s resignation last year
it was decided as an interim step to propose an extension of the current regulation up to the end of the year 
in parallel preliminary findings of an ongoing external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation were also transmitted
the final evaluation report will be submitted to the parliament by september of this year
now to the amendments the commission broadly agrees with the four amendments which have been tabled by the parliament
now let me come to the fourth amendment
i recognise that the parliament would like to see the independent evaluation report extremely soon
a number of honourable members have argued that you should see that by july
that will give us a reasonable period to evaluate  s activities
i want to make that commitment unequivocally
i hope that parliament would be willing to agree this approach
there have been references to the new regulation
i can confirm that the new regulation is under preparation
i can assure honourable members that i have taken account of the criticisms and of the aspirations that have been expressed during the course of this debate
so i hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at am
ecswitzerland agreements
the agreements were signed as early as june  ratified by the swiss parliament on  october  and tomorrow they will have reached the stage of ratification by the european parliament
nevertheless it is as well to remember that this declaration will certainly be different from the  decision in form and substance
i also want to thank the commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations
with regard to my committee s area of responsibility that of citizens freedoms and rights this agreement is welcome
i also want to emphasise that it is important to view the agreement in its entirety
mr president i too want to thank the rapporteur for his report and congratulate him
the two agreements that directly concerned us and that we have analysed concern air transport and road and rail transport
its adoption of the regulation on the liberalisation packages is the most practically significant measure
on the one hand switzerland will gradually forego reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles
it will allow vehicles of  to  tonnes up to the year  on the other hand it will abolish the quotas accordingly
eventually it will replace this system with a road tax of approximately eur  on average
so you can understand why the transport operators are rather critical of that
it is a step in the right direction
after all switzerland is located at the heart of europe but is not yet a member of the union
but there are a few aspects that still need clarification
tonight i will confine myself solely to the question of freedom of movement and will specifically address the subject of crossborder workers
in all there are   crossborder workers in switzerland who come from germany france italy and austria
these crossborder workers are very seriously affected by the most recent deteriorations in swiss pension schemes
under the tenth review which recently came into force this rule was removed
it was replaced by educational credits which were however tied to residence in switzerland
unfortunately european union governments have paid too little attention to this issue until now
i hope all this will change in the near future
the current rules on oldage and surviving dependants insurance conflict with the principle of equal treatment and equal status
crossborder workers pay in just as much pension insurance as their swiss counterparts but receive considerably lower pensions
i hope that this unilateral discrimination by the swiss government will be remedied in the wake of this bilateral agreement
i am extremely grateful to the rapporteur for touching on and bringing up this question in his explanatory statement
a glance at the map shows that these are probably not the last negotiations and agreements we will see between the union and switzerland
for that can only be to the benefit of future negotiations and future agreements which we will be negotiating and deciding bilaterally
mr president the bilateral agreements between the european union and switzerland are analogous to the multilateral agreement arrangements that have come into effect within the framework of the european economic area
it is the opinion of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party that the european parliament for its own part should support their adoption
the merging europe has organised itself into a series of concentric rings at the core of which has been the founder members of the european union
the attempt to form a political and defence community came to nothing but the european community was created
the outer seven as opposed to the six formed the european free trade association efta
the expansion of the six into a community of in the first instance eight and then twelve went relatively smoothly
since these instances of enlargement a debate has begun on differentiated integration
the first agreement on the european economic area was offered to the efta countries
it was then that concentric circles were being spoken of for the first time
eea membership was rejected in a swiss referendum
so the only countries remaining in the eea were iceland norway and liechtenstein
bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for switzerland
negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the european union
now that the union is growing fast it is reasonable that it should be subject to internal differentiation
for then we would not have to negotiate and decide seven different agreements but all this would be a matter of course
i very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years
to that end it will pay a contribution in line with its gdp yet participate fully in the programme
that is a major advantage for both sides
they have no say as regards its content
that is something the european parliament could organise
in fact this would also be a step towards bringing switzerland and the european union closer together
i would very much hope we could do that
aside from that let me thank mr carraro again for this excellent report
anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report
once again many thanks and i hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow
we want closer cooperation in europe
we want more dialogue
the peaceful settlement of conflict  ie democracy  versus the declaration of war
in fact war never has been a solution for the people of europe
we need ground rules for democracy and in the end we must also abide by them
that should set us thinking
i believe it is important that we use democratic methods to safeguard peace
in fact austria was always seen as the blueeyed boy in matters of human rights and democracy
but that means talking to each other meeting each other analysing things pragmatically finding compromises
in austria mr haider resigned on  may
he no longer plays an active role in austrian politics
we very much welcome the report by mr carraro and his colleagues
i totally agree with the remarks of the honourable member mr linkohr about the quality of the report
one or two honourable members have been able to bring in subjects about which they care passionately like the honourable member mr rubig and i commend them on their inventiveness
but it has been a useful debate which has reflected the importance of the subject
we are extremely satisfied that parliament has given this verbal approval to the seven agreements with switzerland
they are the result of four years of extremely difficult and tough negotiations
the outcome of those negotiations has been excellent and i am delighted that parliament has reacted in the way that it has
the agreements are very important
they are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well
they unblock the stalemate in the relations with one of our closest neighbours and our second biggest trading partner
they open the way to closer relations and i hope to further integration
equally important a viable solution has now been found for alpine transit
the european standard of free movement of persons will also be introduced in relations with switzerland
i want to make it absolutely plain that the commission shares these concerns
as a number of honourable members have said the swiss parliament has already approved the seven agreements they did that in october last year
we very much hope that the swiss people themselves will give their blessing in the referendum scheduled for may 
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at am
financial assistance to moldova
examined in human and economic terms moldova is faring very badly
the social situation is chaotic and democratic progress painfully slow
a civil war and the repercussions of the economic crisis in russia have been paralysing the country for a long time now
industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally
a modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions
a look at the figures will show the level of desperation that exists
bilateral financial aid via the tacis programme has been reasonably successful
this however is not enough
positive action to develop moldova must be supported with measures that boost the democratic system
the circle can only be broken by establishing moldova s own energy sector and the diversification of its export trade
the other problem with regard to russia is connected with the withdrawal of troops from moldovan territory
furthermore talks on dismantling russian missiles stockpiled in moldova must be pushed through immediately
my report was unanimously adopted in committee
there were good and sensible additions made to it by the committee on budgets
i hope that this spirit of consensus will be present too in tomorrow s sitting
the european union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries
there is however a ceiling to this provision of loans which has been determined in interinstitutional agreements
that is a maximum annual figure of eur  million from the guarantee fund
this causes problems for possible new loans from the european union because this ceiling is inflexible
the people once again find themselves living in poverty
the average monthly per capita income in moldova is only approximately eur 
for days now there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in moldova
so we are quite literally witnessing this country s almost desperate fight for economic survival and political existence
geographically moldova is a narrow strip of land between ukraine and romania
many young moldovans are looking towards the european union
some are studying at our universities and technical colleges thanks to funding from the european union and its member states
at home most of them want moldova to become more open to the european union
how can we the european parliament make it easier for moldova to become more open
but moldova must also know where it wants to go
in that case it also deserves stronger support on our part
that support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration
we hope moldova will opt for renewal and for europe
mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs matikainenkallstrom s report deserves our full support
she has guided this child in difficult circumstances for which i thank her
when we talk of transitional economies we might ask where these economies are really going
it seems that the direction is not always clear
moldova imports all its raw materials from abroad and is very dependent on energy imports
moldova s need for finance will be huge in the years to come
the russian crisis on  august  had an enormous effect on moldova
it has become a ragamuffin state
the basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat
no nation can live and function like that
the balance of trade surplus is a massive   
we are taking stability eastwards so that we will not have to import instability from there
the next zone of enlargement the following zone of candidate countries will be the one we shall have to concentrate on
we have to create an area of special action of which moldova will be a part and we have to help them
mr president i would also like to thank the rapporteur marjo matikainenkallstrom for preparing a sound report
she has got to grips with the issue in a comprehensive way and raised some important issues connected with it
our group supports the rapporteur s views
as has been said here several times the situation in moldova is extremely difficult
the country s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone
discrepancies in income have grown wildly and half the population lives below the poverty line
it will be extremely hard for moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance
the union s support for moldova is thus in place
mr president establishing and consolidating a multiethnic state is no picnic in political terms
moldova is still living proof of this
ever since its conception in  it has been faced with intransigent separatism from the dnestr republic
hence the present third request for macrofinancial support from the european union
given the level of exchange rate stability and internal currency stability achieved by moldova i can go along with this
however i have two questions
what has been the effect of the european union s two previous capital injections into that country
could the commission be specific about this
also amendment no  tabled by the competent committee seems to clash with the objective of this specific longterm loan
mr president i should like to extend a warm thank you to mrs matikainenkallstrom for the effort she has put into this report
the european union is prepared to invest eur  million equivalent to sek  million in a longterm loan
moldova is a country where the community or society has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas
the average wage among state employees is mdl  which is to say approximately sek  or about eur 
the lowest pension is a mere quarter of this or mdl 
because the state s finances have been completely undermined neither state employees nor pensioners receive their payments on time
many have to wait for over a year for their money and sometimes even longer
what we see fully revealed here is the harvest of the dragon s teeth sown by communism
moldova is today experiencing general migration
we can do nothing other than support this country europe s very poorest
therefore the commission will support these amendments in the council and i hope they can be taken forward
nevertheless i would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments
amendments nos   and  advocate the establishment of a new committee to control this type of aid
in our opinion this initiative would be excessively bureaucratic and would not make sense
i would remind you that the economic and financial committee is not a normal committee
it is a committee provided for in the treaties which in practice consists of personal representatives of the ministers for economic and financial affairs
in our view these are the people who really have the ability to carry out this management
by definition macrofinancial assistance includes a series of general economic indicators which are not always available at that time
in some cases they will be available to us in other cases they will not
by means of both reports the commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information
nevertheless in order to assess the aid we should be allowed more time
lastly i would like to make a comment on mr seppanen s concerns regarding the budgetary availability of resources for this type of aid
in our view there is no difficulty
we believe that this type of aid can be dealt with by means of the current budgetary resources
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
as such the grounds for the sanctions imposed by the  on one member state should be rescinded immediately
it says  in the german version of the minutes
would you be so kind as to check again whether the various language versions are all in order
mr goepel the services have already informed me of this error and all the versions will be corrected
the minutes were approved
combating counterfeiting and piracy
piracy and counterfeiting constitute a risk to consumer health and safety
counterfeiters take advantage of the investments made by bona fide industry in new product research and development and in advertising
this also undermines the fiscal resources of the state authorities
finally it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime
if we are to prevent this scourge we must first familiarise ourselves with it
of course each member state has its own internal regulations for law enforcement
in order to make them more effective we must endeavour to harmonise current legislation and thereby remove the disparities between protection systems
obviously penal sanctions must be made more stringent and civil measures and procedures must be simplified
the approximation of the penal sanctions applied by different nations in the case of customs offences is certainly desirable
it will also be appropriate to pay particular attention to matters of international judicial cooperation
mr president i want to congratulate mrs fourtou on this important report
it is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and most importantly for the protection of consumers
the consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace
it can be dangerous to health
it can certainly be dangerous to innovation
it can be dangerous for the future of research
this is not a victimless crime
we are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace
my second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker
it is this there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks
these must be kept separate
a number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear
we do not want to see these two debates confused
mr president this report is extremely late in coming given that the commission s green paper was adopted on  october 
the green paper is of course a good one
the legal affairs committee has incorporated most of the proposals made by the various committees asked for an opinion
what is important is that we are moderate and restrained when it comes to adopting the report
the union for a europe of nations group for example has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market
specifically i think that amendment no  tabled by mrs thomasmauro which requests that border controls be established at internal borders is extremely dangerous
mr president this is a useful draft legislative provision
we must consider the implications of these inferior quality products for consumers
we must find the means to curb the globalisation of counterfeiting and piracy
this text illustrates our inability to regulate the internal market since we eliminated internal border controls within the european union
should the aforesaid undertaking not be a condition sine qua non
i wished to point this out in my amendment no  which was adopted within the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy
in adopting this very important amendment realistic and constructive members of parliament will be cultivating the art of good border management
our markets are adversely affected by counterfeiting and piracy as are all world markets
i foresee the risks of allowing harmonisation to become an end in itself
given the real risk of losing focus i should like to issue a warning to the commission
many jobs in the textile sector the automobile industry and the sphere of culture also depend on these
but of course there is no fundamental difference between the two
in some ways the most interesting challenge posed by these relatively new forms of crime are the means of countering them
this tends to emphasise the need to harmonise more than is appropriate or necessary in the circumstances
we are often glibly told rightly in fact i believe that we are moving into a knowledgebased society
if that happens we allow it to happen at our peril
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place at  am
transitional civil administrationpeace accords
in this regard i nonetheless feel a certain unease
more information is required in this area
in accordance with the present proposal this type of measure is now to be transferred to the first pillar
there appear to be a number of gaps in this area
there must be a great readiness to engage in continued operations of this kind
moreover we must subsequently be given detailed reports on how for example the transitional administration is working
there are positive features to be mentioned
the present proposal also contains a new budget item of eur  million
the committee on budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures
there is a definite desire on the part of parliament to come up with the aid required and we are aware that the needs are very great indeed
i think that the sum of  million we are talking about here emphasises the need to review the budget
it is unreasonable that support for other poor regions in the world should be affected by the problems in the balkans
to sum up i think that we must now give more consideration to the quality of the operations
these considerations must not lead to the aid programme becoming bogged down in vague decisionmaking processes
against this background we support the laschet report
for this reason i would like to congratulate him on his splendid work
although this would appear to be a purely technical measure there are certain problems associated with it
the first concerns category 
category  is already overloaded
this transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in category 
another problem concerns competence
for this reason the regulation must be amended so that parliament may maintain its power of influence
under this agreement the council and parliament do not interfere with the content of each other s budget
mr president ladies and gentlemen i too would like to express our group s support for the rapporteur s report
this is what is really at issue in bosnia or in kosovo
the resolution indeed is silent on the key issue which is the validity of the policy implemented in the former yugoslavia
what is the state of affairs five years on in bosniaherzegovina
how is the outcome of the war in kosovo to be appraised
how much did the military intervention cost
how much did the destruction cost
what is more the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful
for example the level of the wages handed out to international organisations only serve to undermine these regions further
for example and this is still more tragic there are still no effective controls on the distribution of aid
even the committee on budgetary control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of european union aid to bosniaherzegovina
the deutschmark is foisted on kosovo and the law of the market prevails
as far as we are concerned the outcome of the military intervention speaks for itself
milosevic is still in power
kosovo is a ravaged country
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  am
the sitting was suspended from  am until the vote at  am
welcome
vote
 fr today parliament adopted the common position on the legal aspects of electronic commerce as it stands
everyone will acknowledge the value of clear regulations in a continually developing field where the economic and legal stakes are considerable
i shall not dwell on aspects which have already been extensively discussed
i should like at this point to return to one aspect i consider more fundamental
today we are setting regulations quite rightly for the litigation which may arise from impersonal and therefore risky electronic commercial transactions
the law must be the expression of a general political vision a social project
otherwise all it can do is follow after developments that it can neither anticipate nor control
international or supranational structures never have that extra spark of spirit which engenders motivating ideas and collective commitment
the european union is no exception
carraro recommendation a
so pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong
therefore the pensioners party has a liking for switzerland
 fr the report under discussion today concerns relations between switzerland and the european union
let us remember that switzerland participated in the negotiations that led to the signing of the agreement on the european economic area
it was therefore necessary to find some means of maintaining links between switzerland and the eu
this led to the signing of bilateral agreements
since  switzerland has submitted a series of requests to participate in the internal market in specific sectors
following these requests negotiations between switzerland and the european union resulted in a package of sectoral agreements
this represented a minimum guarantee of coherence
this proposal for a decision combines the seven proposals previously submitted by the commission in a single legal instrument with some amendments
shortly thereafter the council referred the matter to the european parliament
as it happens our rapporteur is urging us to do so and i shall follow his lead
we must send out a positive political message by giving our assent
i should however like to add a few minor points
switzerland must indeed clarify its position in relation to the european union
it must not be allowed to carry on picking and choosing the european policies it wishes to implement
laschet report a
let us make no mistake
for all the above reasons the french members of the union for a europe of nations group are unable to support mr laschet s report
hatzidakis report a
i hope that we will continue along this path and that national infrastructures will be established which give due consideration to european projects
sterckx report a
in the first place this report gives no precise analysis of the liberalisation of air traffic
there is no mention of its huge impact on the environment
these are the negative results of liberalisation
even the united states of america has not privatised its air traffic control agency
it remains subject to the federal authority of the federal republic of the united states of america
even the home of liberalism did not go for this option
yet the choice made in this report is quite different in fact the opposite the complete antithesis
they make this quite clear on a regular basis
a subsequent return of liberalism will come as no surprise
these are some of the reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report
fourtou report a
on the other hand i have rather more reservations as to the degree of harmonisation required particularly in terms of criminal law
we must face facts we already have tried and tested practices at national level
what we should be doing is coordinating them better rather than ruling them out in the name of a uniformity which would only prove counterproductive
 fr computers audio and video equipment toys fragrances pharmaceutical products clocks and watches cars  absolutely everything is copied
damage to the economy is much more significant
according to the international chamber of commerce the cost of counterfeiting represents between  and  of world trade
sales of illegal compact discs were reported to have increased by almost  in  and comprise  of the world market
in the software sector piracy rates are estimated at  worldwide
the number of jobs lost in the european union is put at   over the past ten years
these figures are probably still greatly underestimated and internet imperialism will make them higher still
this gives us an indication of the major stakes involved for the internal security of our member states
as the rapporteur quite rightly mentioned i think that a balanced policy on the subject must combine prevention and law enforcement
i am thinking for example of pharmaceutical products and spare parts for cars
i think it would also be useful if the forces of law and order were to receive suitable training to be able to detect counterfeit goods more easily
increasing penalties might also have a deterrent effect
counterfeiting and piracy constitute a threat to the proper operation of the internal market
they jeopardise the viability of some of our businesses especially small and mediumsized businesses that undertake research
they introduce distortions of competition
they undermine the foundations of a sound economy
moreover and most especially they mislead the consumer sometimes at the risk of his or her health or safety
this consumer must be protected so much is clear
it is in this spirit that i support mrs fourtou s report
the fact that such activities are often associated with organised crime makes it imperative for us to define most precisely the legal instruments we wish to create in order to combat it
the effectiveness of the law especially within the community area will lie in this precision and in its capacity to provide a realistic response to practical problems
that concludes the voting
adjournment of the session
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
the sitting was closed at  am
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday  may 
 ladies and gentlemen as you know on saturday a horrific accident struck the people of enschede in the netherlands
around four hundred homes have been destroyed by the explosion and more than a thousand have suffered damage
this is one of the most terrible disasters in the netherlands since the second world war
i have contacted the dutch authorities to express our deepest sympathy both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the european parliament
ladies and gentlemen i invite you to observe a minute s silence
the house rose and observed a minute s silence
madam president on behalf of the  delegates there is actually little i could add to your words
german hospitals too have been involved in the care of the wounded dozens of whom are still in hospital
i find this an example of european solidarity which is what we stand for in this parliament
 thank you mr oostlander
the terrorists intended to strike a blow at one of the most precious assets of democracy freedom of expression
this forum means to affirm that intimidation and blackmail are not enough to silence consciences
after spending five years in prison under the franco regime he fell victim to another dictatorship that of terrorism
i also notified the spanish government of our utmost support in the fight against terrorism
agenda
relating to thursday
we can have five items in the human rights section
at the moment we only have four
we therefore have the opportunity to add a further item and i have received three requests
madam president ladies and gentlemen the association agreement between the european union and tunisia has been in force since  march 
madam president for my part i wish to speak on a constructive rather than on a polemical basis i think this is indeed an opportune moment to have a debate on human rights in tunisia
there are no substantial differences between us
secondly i would like to point out that the matter of our relations with tunisia does not end with an urgent debate
thank you mr baron crespo
i think the house is now sufficiently well informed to proceed to the vote
parliament rejected the proposal
and now to the proposal from the group of the european people s party on hooliganism
madam president i wish to thank my own group for allowing this resolution to come this far
it is not often that we discuss urgencies that might be able to change something for the better
we are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect
however next month before we sit again in strasbourg the european football championship starts
this is what this motion is about and i very much hope members will support it
parliament approved the proposal
now i do not think that this is the appropriate place to debate this
however that does mean that we have a problem in the short term namely what we will be doing this coming friday
as i understand it this has not been discussed by the conference of presidents
we can then decide next month what we want to do in the long term
thank you mrs van der laan
as you can see this provides some incentive for you to attend in great numbers on friday in order to vote
but we cannot keep in touch with what is happening
what are you going to do about it mary
thank you mr blak
mrs banotti will reply immediately
madam president this is becoming a regular item
we were not getting interpretation throughout
so dear freddy i did not understand a word you said  but i am sure it was wonderful
mr blak will explain it to you
but let those who want to work here on a friday do so in peace and quiet
ladies and gentlemen as you are well aware we are not going to start a debate on this sensitive issue
i will allow two more speakers and then we shall move on to the order of business
madam president i think there is a misunderstanding here
mrs van der laan spoke about the proposal made by the bureau to the conference of presidents
as i understand it the conference of presidents has not discussed this matter any further
what matters is that we too discuss a proposal from the bureau here and now
surely a proposal from the bureau cannot simply be sidelined
all we want is that it should also be discussed and that a vote should be taken on it
the first possibility is to scrap friday sittings altogether
madam president the competent body in these matters is not the bureau but the conference of presidents
having said that if you wish to continue to discuss the matter i see no objection to this
we shall hear your comments presented as procedural motions
madam president on a point of order
i was simply making a protest about the electronics here
i was unable to receive interpretation and i am sure that certain other members were having difficulty with interpretation earlier
i think i was getting swedish at one point and i could not hear mr blak at all
i just wanted to point that out
thank you mrs ahern we shall take steps to ensure that this does not happen again
madam president on a point of order
it is the same point and for once i agree with mrs ahern
this must be a first
madam president i should like to start where mrs van der laan left off
when a rollcall vote took place at  o clock hardly any of the  proponents were still here
we really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind
madam president i should like to respond to what my fellow member has just said
it is inaccurate therefore to accuse members of sabotage
madam president i could not agree more with the observations made by mr wiebenga
the least we can do is to carefully examine once more how we have filled fridays
i wanted to highlight these two aspects
reference can be made to the last rollcall vote for this
let us examine in a fair manner and through sound discussion how we can fill this partsession
madam president i have little to add after mrs oomen s intervention
i only hope that you will understand this
this is because we already spend a great deal of our time in brussels and strasbourg as it is and because we need the time to talk to our electorate
i support the action in this sense
as i said there is scope for discussing this when we come to examine mr provan s report
madam president ladies and gentlemen i was among those who were present throughout friday
it is easy to check up on because electronic voting took place that day
this has also given rise to quite a major debate in my own country sweden
we must get a serious discussion under way about these matters
either we make friday a proper working day or we do away with it
i will be very brief madam president
moreover i feel that this issue should be discussed in more detail perhaps at a more convenient time
as mr wiebenga said and as i said myself we are currently investigating the best solutions
i cannot therefore put this request to the vote
it only remains for me to express the hope that there will be a good attendance this friday votes or not
i am counting on you all if only for the benefit of the public that attends our debates
agricultural prices
it is in this spirit of optimism that we can begin this debate on our report on the prices for agricultural products in 
in the past this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes
the decisions made under agenda  established many principles not necessarily always for the best as far as agriculture is concerned
this commission proposal too contains a series of points which will again lead to a reduction in farmers incomes
in my report i make my opposition to this absolutely clear
the commission s proposal to reduce the monthly increments would mean another substantial deterioration in farm incomes
in this context we also reject the commission s plan to make the intervention criteria stricter
the agriculture budget is neither a selfservice shop nor a highyielding dairy cow
our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think
after all we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go
we need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term
we need a new vision for our farmers which is forwardlooking and geared towards future needs
i refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments
that is what i want to prevent at all costs
i started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the european agricultural landscape
i should like to finish with the sentence food and drink hold body and soul together 
let us not forget this even in our political considerations and decisions
nothing more nothing less
this is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture
in various european countries large groups of farmers are in dire straits
at present there is a great deal of suffering in silence
so far it would seem that the agricultural budget was born under a lucky star
the eurodollar rate impacts favourably on the budget although certain figures are a cause of concern
there is nothing to say however that things will remain the same forever
despite this the commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget if possible
sometimes these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget
the budget will stick to this principle
am i not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the berlin agreements
and in order to evaluate the  budget effectively we need to know this
but that is not the case
in fact we are discussing the proposals which the commission has tabled following the agenda  reforms
may i at this stage specifically thank the rapporteur mrs jeggle for her work
however i should like to warn you that with this system the annual review by the council the commission and parliament might not perhaps receive the attention which it deserves
the proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned
i should like to fully support the rapporteur s stance in this regard
we should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers incomes
i am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism
this was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar
personally i was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the council at this stage
and as agenda  adopted and extended this approach the establishment of agricultural prices is henceforth multiannual
the same applies to moisture content in cereals
the berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark
logically then it should also set the standard in our debates on internal cap matters
in this connection then i would urge the commission to provide us very quickly with its proposed reform of the com in sugar
mr president the opinion of the committee on budgets and that of the liberal group more or less coincide
this is purely accidental
i will therefore not repeat what i said in the first two minutes
all these points which i mentioned are also backed by the liberal group
i would like to add a few more points however
we are living in an era in which the agricultural budget is extremely tight
the slightest movement in the dollar and euro rates would get us into great difficulty
this being the case the commission will have to make a choice as to what to do with the money that is available
potentially however there is another very large gap
over the past few years we have been faced with outbreaks of epidemics of infectious animal diseases
we had the bse crisis in europe and several european countries suffered from swine fever outbreaks
it was agreed in berlin that this can no longer be the case
without a doubt the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role
up until  the commission should work on the basis of the realistic targets set and should deduce its financial needs from them
as a result of agenda  european farmers had to accept a eur  billion reduction in their income
this meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at eur  billion and it should stay as such
today more deals are concluded in a second than used to be in an entire day and change is the only constant
agricultural prices change particularly quickly
in the eu in  the prices of crop products fell by  and livestock products by 
as a result of excessive overproduction pig prices fell by 
in the saturated marketplace only products produced economically can be sold
the price reductions will destroy farmers livelihoods in europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market
another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution
i am very pleased to see commissioner fischler here to listen to this debate
this happens in many instances
i would also like to congratulate the commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals
article  of the regulation on processed fruits and vegetables provides for lump sum aid
this aid is going to stop very soon it comes to an end during this season
with regard to table grapes on  july aid expires for the production of juice which is included in the com in wine
in my opinion it should be included in the next amendment of the com in fruits
will it be extended
what is the intention here
regulation no  also provides for aid for promotion in the flower and plant sector and this aid is also coming to an end
does this fit in with the commission s plans
they are important sectors because they affect very specific areas
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen agenda  has created a certain kind of stability for the european agricultural policy
it is necessary for this parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 
one thing of which we seem oblivious is the present everyday reality of agriculture
it is the farmers themselves who will ultimately have to pay these costs
the farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations
the question therefore is what are the farmers doing about this
as a result while nominal producer prices have fallen often quite sharply consumer prices have risen
the question is what will farmers and consumers do about this
will they step up their fight
thirdly low quotas and the resultant extortionate fines are eating up the subsidies for the  harvest
thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant
a blatant example is that of oil which also concerns my country and in particular my native island of lesbos
despite declarations that the  subsidy would be grd  producers were only paid grd  one year later
we also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in november since harvest time in greece is in june
the president cut the speaker off
and how are these millions going to be used
i therefore think that this policy calls for caution commissioner
and you have our support
commissioner we are counting on you a great deal
we are speaking from the bottom of our hearts within parliament we are aiming to defend the family farm
we are all aware of the iniquity of the present regulations of the policy on processed tomatoes
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i should like to thank you mrs jeggle very much for your report
after all it is the first which you have tabled in the house
with your permission i will first comment on the background to and the content of the proposals which we have made
it is absolutely right  as has been stated here  that the price package is no longer as significant as it was in the past
that is why it would not have been appropriate  given that this final year has to be fixed now first  to introduce a change here
i shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward
amendment no  seeks to leave the monthly increments unchanged
on the contrary this is the logical consequence of the decisions made in berlin
you see in berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments
but that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts
in the past too we made adjustments more or less  every year
that is why i cannot accept this proposal
that actually puts an end to the debate because as of  april commission regulation ec no  was enacted
i do not think that we should reopen this debate now
that is why i cannot agree to amendments nos  or 
it does not present a particular problem to farmers
it would run counter to the peace clause which states that no new products may be incorporated into the support system
i now come to amendments nos  and 
some clarification is probably called for here
at this stage the commission has specifically decided not to prejudice anything here either
this is a much more complex problem because here the commission had originally intended to make it possible precisely to transfer funds between the two subheadings
however this was rejected by parliament
that is why a transfer of this kind is not possible on the basis of the financial regulation currently in force and the interinstitutional agreement
at the moment however we are of course still in the discussion phase the actual budget debate on the  budget is yet to take place
the study which mr mulder mentioned was also intended to examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory insurance scheme
we will commission a study of this kind
however i have to tell you that the results will not be available until the end of the year
we will not obtain the results from those carrying out the study any earlier than that
however in principle it is the member states who are responsible for this issue
we expect this report to be ready at the beginning of the second half of this year
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
flax and hemp for fibre
it is precisely the possibilities which this branch of agriculture offers of developing products with a promising future which we need to support at european level
i am firmly opposed to this subsidy hunting and strict controls are necessary to ensure compliance with legal provisions
all the same in my opinion the commission proposals overshoot the mark a little
allow me briefly to outline the basic considerations underlying my report
allow me to make one further comment on hemp because there is still some misunderstanding here
the committee on agriculture and rural development adopted this report by a large majority
that is why i should like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who supported me when i was drawing up this report
flax like hemp is a special product with a long european tradition
the reason we are having to hold this debate is to do with the fact that the regulation has gone off the rails
we all know what happened to short flax
we also know that that derailment occurred in southern europe and we need to be prepared to adapt the policy
people have overstepped the mark
at the same time they form a true complement to agricultural policy
they are special products which offer a great deal of added value and employment
it is exactly because of these three facets that we have to be so much more careful about drafting a sound regulation
this is why i give my full backing to mrs schierhuber s report
the amounts which have been mentioned guarantee that cultivation remains profitable and also ensure sound processing
what we need is tighter control on processing to ensure that malpractices are prevented in future
i would like to end on a historical note
an eightyyear conflict failed to destroy the cultivation of flax along the north sea coast
we therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the committee on agriculture
lastly we absolutely agree with the existence of controls in this sector
therefore the existence in every single case of the sales contract between the farmer and the processor seems to us to be essential
we are therefore voting against the report with regard to the disappearance of these contracts
the existence of a contract is the best way of proving that the crop has been sold and processed
i would also like to say i agree with the previous speaker mrs rodriguez ramos regarding average yields
there are no great differences between them
as far as cereals are concerned however the differences are considerable
mr president i am pleased to have this opportunity to address parliament on this very important issue
excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported
in my own nation wales flax processing plants are already being established using european union aid
this is a crucial matter as it affects thousands of hectares of european land with low productive possibilities
for example  of the land mass of my nation wales is nonarable
the importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the european union cannot be overemphasised
i would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard
we also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors
i congratulate the rapporteur and call on the european parliament to support the agriculture committee s report
these situations obviously required modifications which logically should have concentrated on strengthening controls
mrs rodriguez ramos amendments therefore seem to me to be a good solution to the problem
producers in those countries destroyed their harvest whilst they pocketed the subsidies for the crops
it is vital not to lose sight of this objective
the production costs for longfibre flax are higher than those for shortfibre flax and for hemp
it is precisely with the shortfibre variant that farmers fiddled the system
we can go along with the proposal to bring the cultivation of flax under the general support regulation for arable crops
an increase in support should however be accompanied by the following three control measures
thirdly the use of certified seed
finally i would point out that as it is late in the season this regulation will not be able to come into force until the  season
firstly the commission is explaining the need for the reform in terms of an increase in budgetary cost
i do not believe that that is the best way to try to justify the need for a reform although i agree that it is needed
the commission proposal offers a good coherent and precise analysis of the sector in the european union
it explains the importance of flax and hemp production from both an economic and an ecological point of view
however the thing that seems least appropriate to me is the proposal on processing aid
in this case i would like to draw your attention to the increasing number of uses for this type of fibre as several speakers have already pointed out
these were the words of the local minister for agriculture for that region
this type of situation will become inevitable if this amendment is put into practice
it appears to me that they have not made any precise calculation to justify the different amounts for the premiums
neither does there appear to be any precise calculation to justify the maximum guaranteed quantities either at european level or on the different national levels
consequently these quantities are going to hinder development in the european union with regard to short and longfibre flax and hemp
however i shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned
we should note that flax and hemp are environmentallyfriendly crops
they also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources
we should welcome therefore the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification
however i wish to raise the question of land eligibility which appears to be a particular problem in the uk
the commission proposals as i understand them threaten the uk growers and would leave uk processors with no domestic supply of raw material
this would allow expansion should market conditions encourage growth and allow new growers to enter the market
it would be helpful if the commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate
mr president i would firstly like to thank the rapporteur mrs schierhuber
i have a feeling that this type of subject matter is right up her street
i can only say that i agree with the thrust of her report
that is why the commission was right to intervene
flax and hemp are typical crops which could help us find new markets for new agricultural products
encouraging initiatives have been taken in this field and large investments have been made in various countries
i am thus not persuaded that it is absolutely vital to tie certain quotas to certain countries
instead they should be tied to certain user capacities
could he not consider making the use of these products made from flax or hemp compulsory
perhaps this initiative could help us to turn the corner
mr president commissioner fischler the commission appears to have made a sound proposal but in actual fact this is not a sound proposal
you know what procedure this is
mr president the aid scheme for flax and hemp has turned into pure subsidyhunting
for a number of years aid for hemp has been much higher than that for other crops
perhectare aid for hemp is more than twice as high as that for cereals
the commission proposes that aid for hemp should be reduced in three phases to the level of aid that has been set for cereals
it gives farmers time to adapt
i cannot however live with the recommendation from the committee on agriculture and rural development
that would be far out of place moreover it is something i shall be voting against
i take the opposite view namely that the aid should be limited
in place of the reform proposed by the commission at that time however the council simply stepped up controls
the proposal before you today has three main objectives
it is intended to put a stop to subsidyhunting once and for all
you see we are not under any illusions
in the light of budgetary constraints  with which everyone is familiar  the sector has to be more marketoriented
the commission has carefully examined parliament s amendments
then there are others which i am afraid we cannot accept
i now turn to the first proposal on including flax and hemp grown for fibre in the arable crops regulation
i am prepared to accept amendment no  which concerns the formulation of the objectives and amendment no  at least in spirit
however in my opinion it is doomed to failure
consequently i do not agree with amendments nos    and  nor for similar reasons with amendment no 
the same goes for amendment no  which is along the same lines
nevertheless problems could arise in some areas
we will try to find a solution here so as to reduce the possible constraints which might arise
i can accept amendment no  on hemp
there could be room for a certain amount of flexibility however where it is a question of achieving high control levels
that is why i can state my agreement with these amendments and with amendment no  at least in this respect
this is a highly political issue which we can certainly discuss further
however at the present time i do not wish to agree to amendments nos   and 
but the actual objective is clear
it is a fact that processing longflax fibres entails higher costs
a distinction must therefore be drawn between processing aid for longflax fibres and aid for shortflax fibres and hemp fibre
our policy for the sector has to be unambiguous
we can only accept investment in products which are profitable under market conditions
this principle also applies here
that is why i cannot agree to amendments nos  and  even though they definitely contain further food for thought
nevertheless the limits given in the budget cannot be exceeded
the second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities
in view of the wellknown difficulties with checking harvest results these are absolutely indispensable
a maximum guaranteed quantity for the whole community would not be a solution
experience shows that this only leads to disputes between member states and makes it more difficult to find a real solution
that is why i cannot accept amendments nos    to  and 
i can accept amendments nos  and  for those instances when the farmer and the primary processor are one and the same person
as far as the import of hemp and hempseed is concerned i agree that we need a practicable solution
but this would mean that the aid per hectare for the next marketing year would have to be set this year in accordance with the system currently in force
in this case i would be bound by the figures in the  budget
a reform of this sector is absolutely essential
i think that you agree with me on this
we really should not allow this kind of situation to develop
mr president allow me to ask the commissioner one more question
commissioner you mentioned the controls which will need to be carried out in connection with the processing premium and these must indeed take place
mr president with your permission i should like to ask the commissioner a supplementary question
perhaps i will begin with the second question which was asked by the rapporteur
in this regard i have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind
i now turn to the first question which was asked by mr graefe zu baringdorf
i am sorry but what you are proposing is still based on an assumption namely that this check is carried out
it is simply the case that the current system is not working and that is why i believe we have no choice but to change it
and so i do not want us to turn the system completely on its head
thank you very much commissioner fischler
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on tuesday at  noon
civil liability and motor vehicles
mr president i must and can be brief
it is about improved protection for accident victims in the european union
this directive resolves a large number of the problems which usually arise when people are involved in an accident in another country
first of all however and before looking back i wish to take a look into the future
commissioner bolkestein a draft fifth directive already exists
i have drawn it up and it will soon be put before parliament
i very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue
the fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline
as you can see we wish this debate on improved protection for accident victims to gain a certain momentum
i would be very grateful to you in particular commissioner if we could achieve this together
that is a very big step forward
when we debated this some questions were still open
you overcame resistance from within your own commission
this was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it
i hope that where the protection of accident victims and its improvement is concerned we will also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the future
the joint draft adopted by the conciliation committee certainly represents great progress for our community
in making these statements i would like to declare that i particularly support this report and once again i thank mr rothley and the commission for their endeavours on behalf of our citizens
mr rothley was extremely kind in thanking the commission for what it has done
the commission is duly thankful to him for that initiative
i wish to say that the commission welcomes the adoption of this fourth motor insurance directive by parliament
as mr rothley pointed out every year there are more than   car accidents involving vehicles from different member states
however the current system of compensation for people involved in an accident outside their home country does not work satisfactorily
this is also a measure which will bring the european union closer to the citizens of the union
mr rothley has announced a fifth directive
i have to tell mr bigliardo that this is a matter which does not concern this directive
strictly speaking i could end my response there but his comments deserve a fuller answer
you cannot ask french or german citizens living in italy to pay a different premium from italian citizens
that is a clear case of discrimination
but that is not the case
the premia differ according to the number of accidents in each region and are therefore the same for italians and nonitalians
they relate to the different areas of italy
i do not think that the commission can intervene on that point
thank you very much commissioner bolkestein
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on tuesday at  noon
development cooperation with south africa
it is very worrying that we should find ourselves in such a situation
this took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which i just mentioned
the council finally presented its proposal
the first question refers to commitology
during the previous five years the budgetary framework had been eur  million per year
both amendments seem wellconsidered
this is actually an unproblematic regulation and also in fact an unproblematic report
this is therefore predominantly about renewing the legal base for this cooperation as the preceding regulation expired in december 
our former fellowmep mr fassa presented the report for its first reading in parliament in may of last year
the council accepted nearly all of the amendments
nevertheless i do wonder why the council s common position was officially only sent to parliament in march of this year
of course the rapporteur also referred to this
no doubt people in south africa itself are also asking themselves what conclusions they should draw from the council s behaviour
secondly the threshold of eur  million which has now been settled on constitutes a good compromise in my view
small projects can be planned and implemented efficiently by the institutions and organisations on the ground
the limit of eur  million gives sufficient room for manoeuvre
in making these efforts the rapporteur has for his part done everything within his power to present a proper report on the regulation
i very much hope that we will indeed still be able to avoid the danger of a third reading mr martinez martinez
for the time being i offer you my warmest congratulations on this
the south africans have already managed to put an end to legal discrimination against the majority of the population and to hold democratic elections
today it is a question of anchoring the rule of law more firmly in the state
from a political point of view the union s adoption of this new regulation is not only an acknowledgement of the results achieved by the reform process hitherto
i read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level
food housing and sometimes clinics and schools are made available to farm workers and their families
the situation is similar in large areas of south africa
this cannot be in the interests of south africa and it cannot be in our interests either
by adopting this regulation the union is showing that it still backs the economic political and societal reform process in south africa
the south african government needs all sections of society to have lasting confidence in the development of the country
i hope that this expectation too will be taken seriously in pretoria
the ppede group will be voting in favour of the report
we thank you very much for it
we are clearly in a very serious situation
the regulation for south africa expired on  december 
this budget line is the work of the european parliament
i was the budget rapporteur in  when the development committee established the line
surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history
coming as this does after ouzo and grappa we are in danger of sending a very bad signal to south africa
decisions need to be made
we cannot risk delay
for example i am very familiar with the south african human rights foundation that would be endangered
if there is delay if agreement is not reached on the regulation then new programmes will be affected too
even the  budget of eur  million would not be committed
let us be clear what we are talking about
we are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas
we risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in south africa
the european parliament position is and always has been realistic and morally right
however i must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay
it is the first year of the south africa trade agreement
how does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations
we must continue our commitment to supporting south african efforts to overcome the legacy of apartheid
to do that we have to have a regulation sooner rather than later
mr president apartheid in south africa may have been abolished but it has not yet disappeared
they may want to escape their past but they are compromising their own future in the process
the key goal of development strategy should therefore be to correct the imbalance in growth created by apartheid
the council has sat on the regulation for far too long
all the signs are there that its association with the negotiations regarding the trade agreement was spurious
a maximum of  million seems very reasonable to me
the commission delegation must be sufficiently equipped to be able to do this independently and to a professional standard
mr president south africa has enormous potential
there is so much there which so few have enjoyed
economic growth is a necessary but not an adequate condition for development
what is needed is for resources to be better distributed and correctly allocated to meet all social needs
the apartheid regime has been abolished all that is left to tackle now is apartheid itself
mr president i would like to start by adding my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur
i strongly support his aim of getting this regulation brought into force as quickly as possible with no third reading
an estimated  of black south africans are jobless as compared with just  of whites
a quarter of schools have no water within walking distance
half of south african households are classed as poor
 of adult south africans are illiterate and  million south africans live in informal shacks or on land they neither own nor rent
it is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries transition
the loss of customs duty alone is extremely high in some cases
in swaziland for example this accounts for up to  of all government revenue
in spite of its own challenges south africa is already demonstrating its commitment to support its neighbours in the region
for example in its agreement to a highly asymmetrical liberalisation agreement with the other sadc countries which will benefit those countries
the european union needs the same generosity of spirit
in the light of this the continuity of the development connection has been in the balance
accordingly i would like to thank the rapporteur for the drive he has displayed in dealing with this subject matter
i share his criticism regarding the eight months which the council deemed necessary to formulate its position
although development cooperation and trade are very much interrelated they should not be played off against each other
the deliberate delay in approving these regulations would seem to suggest that there is little real involvement with south africa
this is irrespective of how fair the european negotiating position is in terms of trade
this document addresses both the fight against poverty and improvement in infrastructure
would the commission be able to answer that
this is an example to draw on when it comes to determining the strategy for other countries
i would like to finish off with just one remark for the rapporteur
this is why south africa s neighbouring countries can also benefit from european development projects
it seems that coherence and consistency are gradually gaining ground in the eu s development policy
surely we cannot continue to work in this way
it is interesting to note that half this report is taken up by the procedural points the rapporteur has had to work his way through
most welcome is the fact that the council has made poverty alleviation a top priority
this should strengthen the partnership between south africa and europe
the commission might like to comment on this particular point
i would also like to hear from the commission on how we can streamline the system
this regulation is bound to have an impact on neighbouring states and i hope the commission will take this into consideration
the rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future
my group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in
we would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification
i must confess that the slow progress in council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled
mr president i am apparently not the only one who hangs her head in shame when it comes to south africa
in  it became our key partner in development cooperation
the fact that that country received most support from europe was justified
in his eminent report the rapporteur emphatically referred to the expiry date of  december 
the council needed no fewer than eight months to determine its position
we are deeply ashamed about such a state of affairs which resembles a cattle market
there is another reason to feel ashamed
i think this is disgraceful
mr president commissioner we will naturally assent to the amendments tabled by the committee on cooperation and development
poverty is an injustice
we want the reconstruction of kosovo
we are happy to finance it but not with money intended to combat poverty
this is unethical
we also support the second amendment
it may seem less important but i think that the resources for the procedure should be retained
this is why we give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur
relations between the european union and south africa must not be damaged
south africa has a vigorous constitution with a clear commitment to human rights and freedoms the country has a constitutional court whose judgements are respected by the president
it can show that it is freedom together with democratic and strong ethical and moral values through which africa can advance furthest
the time has come to say enough is enough
cooperation requires a positive attitude of good faith and responsibility on the part of both cooperating parties
as this has not been the case i cannot in all conscience support the rapporteur s position
i should like to retain the possibility of increasing this threshold for the south africa budget line in the future if need be
as a result the commission has agreed on the necessary budget adjustments to accommodate new needs
this exercise has been very complex it has required a very sensitive balancing of the political priorities across the eu s regional programmes
this is below your proposal of eur m but it is significantly higher than the eur m the council proposed
i understand your determination not to reduce the financial amounts for development aid to south africa
mr president you have heard the commissioner s request that the vote be delayed that is that it should not take place tomorrow
on principle i am always willing to discuss issues again
i do not feel at the moment that parliament wishes to delay the vote
i would not be opposed to that and i do not reject that possibility
if that is the case then parliament is unnecessary and all our dignity as an institution has been lost
i am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month
i believe that it would be very dangerous to prolong this process but in any event we must not take responsibility
there has been a misunderstanding
the commissioner can speak for himself but the commission was not requesting postponement of the vote
the commission was simply making a point on amendment no  as i understand it
perhaps the commissioner would like to explain the point he was making on the amendment
i said i would welcome it if a postponement of the vote were considered as a possibility
it is totally in the hands of parliament as it should be
it is simply in order to minimise that risk that i am expressing my views as i have here
the decision is of course totally in parliament s hands
that concludes the debate
any motion to delay a vote would have to be put to the house immediately before the vote which will be taken at noon on tuesday
the sitting was closed at  pm
decision on urgent procedure
mr president the committee on industry considers that this is an extremely important issue and should be dealt with as a matter of great urgency
i therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure
mr wynn chairman of the committee on budgets asked for an opinion has the floor
also i have not had a chance to speak to my good friend mr westendorp
firstly i should like to make it clear that the committee on budgets supports any aid to montenegro
it has done so in the past and will do so in the future
on this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now
we are of the opinion that the relevant committees need to study the details of this proposal
we should not be bounced into a decision because the council deems it to be necessary
as for budgets our main concern is where the money is coming from
we should leave it until next month
the committees can debate it and we can vote on it at the june partsession
thank you mr wynn
that is a very sensible opinion
mr president in my opinion this proposal has been submitted under rather strange procedural circumstances
despite this as speaker on behalf of the ppede group i am of the opinion that the urgency is such that we need to take it extremely seriously
accordingly regardless of the mistakes in the procedure i have to say on behalf of my group that we would like to support this request for urgent procedure after all
it might be helpful to verify this
however it would be an insult to the people of montenegro if we rejected this urgency today
montenegro is in great danger especially from belgrade and i think we should send out this signal
however we should wait until the commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money
it cannot take it away from bosnia
it cannot take it away from kosovo
mr president firstly i am against the urgency for the reasons expounded by the chairman of the committee on budgets
there is in fact no urgency because the money would be released for august
secondly if we look carefully in the line which has been applied until now there are still eur  million which have not been used
therefore there is no uncertainty and no urgency and we can study this issue again calmly at a later date
parliament agreed to urgent procedure
 budget  parliament s estimates
the next item should be the presentation by the commission of the preliminary draft budget for 
unfortunately the commissioner has not yet arrived although she is on her way
i therefore propose that we examine the next item on the agenda
what have we focused on in parliament s budget 
i should like to outline this briefly with reference to five main points
both are provided for by figures in the draft budget
secondly we must also exercise extreme restraint in the area of staff policy in the coming year
we cannot allow parliament s staff numbers to increase exorbitantly just because there is some financial room for manoeuvre
and we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions
thirdly we must prepare ourselves for the enlargement of the european union and this applies to parliament even more than to the other institutions
that is the wrong way forward
it is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions
i am pleased to see the commissioner is now with us
i have taken over your role insofar as we are discussing parliament s budget first and shall then move on to the commission s budget
fourthly we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the european parliament since the amsterdam treaty entered into force
i should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern
my fifth point is that this increased responsibility must also find expression with regard to groups in the european parliament
that is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile
that is the right way forward
i have taken note of the amendments to my report proposed by my fellow delegates with a great deal of interest
we must prepare for enlargement but we do not need to start recruiting interpreters from the candidate countries as early as next year
we need to be a bit more realistic in our approach to the important question of enlargement
we need to take account of that in our calculations
however i should also like to extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the committee on budgets for their fair cooperation
i think i can present you with a budget which has earned parliament s confidence
that quite clearly is a way of longterm planning which is very sensible at this stage of parliament s life
there are three things which i would like to emphasise in particular in this parliament budget 
it is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us
the sooner we can make sure that the image of the european union is reflected by one european house the better it will be
the last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement
we are aware that in the last parliament a lot of work was done on this by vicepresident cot
his report was never released to members
i suspect the commission might wish to do that as well because it is a problem which rightly in this amendment relates to interinstitutional matters
mr president let me also start by congratulating mr ferber on a comprehensive estimate of parliament s revenue and expenditure
our main priority has to be to explain to european citizens what we are doing why we are doing it and how we are doing it
do we really believe that by committing less than half a per cent of parliament s language budget the political decision will be made and taken out of our control
what is the point of approving a joint operation whilst at the same time we are preventing any recruitment of people
it is necessary if the admission of the new member states into the institution is to run smoothly from a language point of view
i reiterate that we should not preempt any political decisions to be taken on enlargement
what we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement
the average time that it takes for a case to be heard has risen from  months in  to  months last year
that is a very long wait
how are they possibly going to be effective with  members
it is important that we plan and prepare
i have been disappointed by some aspects of the report s focus
it focuses too much on the minutiae of detail in sometimes preventing administrative changes in staffing and frustrating strategic vision
there is a contradiction in the rapporteur s argument
he has always focused on outsourcing of parliament s services
here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working
i am also disappointed that the report ignores one of the biggest inefficiencies we have
members of the european parliament are the only parliamentarians who have no say in the location of their seat
a seat on three sites is the most incredible waste of time money travel and transport
it also confuses the roles of the organisation
mr president mr markus ferber has produced an excellent report on which i wish to congratulate him
the parliament budget is essentially an administrative budget since wage costs constitute the largest item of expenditure
in the budget appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous  
this increase is so huge that no other institution could even contemplate an increase of administrative costs of this magnitude
already at this early stage the intention is to spend this increase on the creation of  new posts and apparently  more will be created as a result of the amendment by the bureau
for the sake of comparison i would like to refer to the  period during which parliament established a total of only  new official posts
in addition the budget contains a significant number of new staff promotions
mr president it is necessary in this context to address the issue of the policy of the european parliament in its capacity as an employer
reallocation of resources is necessary and consequently also reform of staffing regulations
mr president i too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for his report and for facilitating open communication
mr ferber s report does not just contain political aspects but is in fact largely composed of administrative aspects
i will start by quoting and commenting on a number of political statements
my group wholeheartedly agrees with the line taken in the report that the council and parliament should draft a statute in the short term and should do this in joint cooperation
they should compile a statute for the members of the european parliament and independently of that a statute for the member s assistants
we support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year
we must avoid hidden subsidies for european political parties at all costs
quite apart from this the report also covers many administrative aspects
it is not because i am new i think that i have great difficulty in passing judgement on this
in my opinion it is mainly up to a manager to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy
surely a great deal depends on the organisation of your group and maybe not every group wants to work in exactly the same way
i think that we should really rethink the system
i understand that during the reform of parliament consideration will also be given to allowing groups to take responsibility for their own affairs and i wholeheartedly support this
i would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians
i am not against this increase in principle
what i do object to however is running ahead of the report and i am also opposed to it because i am sure that in september it will transpire that we will need to prioritise various issues
for example the rent we pay for the buildings may increase
we will need to decide whether we want to inject more funding into other institutions in preparation for enlargement
we will no doubt return to these points of criticism in september when we will have the precise figures in front of us
as such it is not really a criticism but i do object to running ahead of a decision
i find this rather strange but perhaps she has not yet said her last word
we shall see in time
yet on the other hand in the ferber report members of parliament are awarding themselves fortunes
we are awarding ourselves a second computer claiming that one is not enough
we are awarding ourselves a  pay rise from a zerogrowth budget
moreover generally speaking the objective is to reduce the budget
but not in this case
this paragraph does parliament no credit
if we adopt an attitude we cannot express any indignation at waste while at the same time putting forward a budget of this type
on behalf of the radicals in this house i must inform you that i shall be voting against mr ferber s report
we are in agreement and we are very happy
we congratulate him wholeheartedly
i hope that in september new appropriations will be provided for these lines
i am very glad that mr ferber has reacted to the report of the court of auditors on the funding of the political groups
we fully agree with the rapporteur s view concerning the linguistic staff necessary for enlargement
we must initiate the preparatory administrative measures
six new countries  with at least five new languages  in  means that we will have to make a great effort to adapt
we therefore support all mr ferber s amendments
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to start by expressly welcoming mr ferber s report in its broadest outlines
the challenge which faces us has been described
one can in fact do no more than repeat it
we cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directlyelected parliament to lag behind what the council can do
there is no point in the president of our parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page
that is not enough it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well
in this respect it is both right and important  and i expressly disagree with mr dell alba here  that we prepare ourselves properly
nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now
having scrimped and saved this money ourselves we then need to use it to good purpose
to good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this parliament
we are still within the  margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it
at no point do we go over parliament s  share of administrative costs
i think that shows that our approach is very serious here and we do not want to promise any cloud cuckoo land
we shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge
not because we are afraid of being forced to do so
no we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here
the basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where
and it is needed
however we must head off criticism on procedural grounds or because we have accommodated certain sums under various budget headings
but when we are specifically called upon to move forwards we should do so decisively
as far as specific preparations are concerned we need for example to make preparations for more buildings
so we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management
according to one estimate this will mean another  translators and interpreters
no preparations need to be made now
we shall support the release of the cot report  that is one part of mr elles motion
mr president allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur mr ferber for the good work he has done
there is a lot in this report which has been well thoughtout and which it is very easy indeed to support
what is more that may be an underestimate
a few days ago the commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new member states by the year 
even that figure is awfully large bearing in mind the number of new languages involved
that is precisely why it is so important that the issue is highlighted right now
that is what the rapporteur is doing and i think it is excellent
we must not in a few years time find ourselves in a situation in which the issue has still not been resolved
we should also be clear about the fact that things are happening very quickly right now
mr president i congratulate mr ferber on his report
these types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job
my only criticism is that amendments nos  and  should have been tabled in someone else s name for the ppe group
i shall explain why shortly
as chairman of this committee i have discovered that your loyalties are spread very wide
i also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time
this sometimes leaves me bereft of my own loyalties to myself and what i want to say
i am not saying that we have done that
however if that is the impression we are going to give we have to be very careful and realise the consequences
not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through
the first reading will be time when the final decisions are taken and cognisance has been taken of that
the british newspapers will be full of gbp m per mep  that is what they cost
however we are trying to reduce those costs especially on buildings
one only has to look at paragraphs  to  to see how serious we are about the buildings policy
the policy of ramassage has been a great success for this parliament
finally one of the great problems in our institution is that we have no statute for members assistants or political parties
what is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors
it has to be this way as we have been through a tricky time and there are permanent tensions and glaring contradictions
does enlargement require subtle changes in the membership and functioning of this parliament
this applies to the european union as a whole
we are at a turning point and now that we have reached this point nothing will be the same as it was before and things will not remain as they are now
now that the process of enlargement has been launched fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition
the need to make the economic sphere correspond to the political sphere is becoming increasingly clear
we are swinging between deepening and dilution solidarity and selfishness decisiveness and delay coherence and contradiction and convergence and divergence
i congratulate mr ferber on the care he has taken over this work
as far as i am concerned  and we should be very clear about this  new challenges require new resources
i hear what mr wynn the chairman of the committee has said about prudence
there is a delicate balance to be struck and i know that in his report the rapporteur has striven towards it
i broadly welcome mr ferber s report
however there are three fronts to which parliament needs to pay more attention between now and september
the first as other colleagues have mentioned is the issue of languages
i had the honour of sitting on mr cot s working group on multilingualism
if we leave it any longer once we start enlargement we will not be in a position to continue multilingualism
the decision will be taken for us
we were almost in that position with finnish at the last enlargement
we shall find ourselves in that position again come the next enlargement unless we take hard decisions now
so i want parliament to rethink the  language posts
the second area where we still have much to do as an institution is informatics
we have come a long way but there are further benefits to be obtained from informatics
finally again something i have heard you mr president talk about the issue of legal advice
we need to enhance the legal advice we have as a parliament to support us through the conciliation and other procedures
finally i should like to make it clear that i am not asking parliament to spend massive amounts of new money
mr president ladies and gentlemen mr ferber i should like to make a point of congratulating you on your report
in this respect congratulations once again on your report especially on the fact that the report on the budget  looks beyond the budget 
thank you very much commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
presentation by commission of preliminary draft budget for 
the next item is the presentation by the commission of the preliminary draft budget for 
access to new technologies is not very well developed in small and mediumsized enterprises
the preliminary draft budget also contains a new focus on foreign policy
we have already had the opportunity to debate this in great detail especially assistance in the balkans
so now a few figures on the overall budget
i should point out that the average growth forecast for the budgets of the member states is 
i stress this because it will certainly play an important part during the debate with the council
what does this mean for the european state quota
by that i mean what proportion of the total gross national product of the european community is absorbed by the european union budget
there are very positive growth prospects here
is the change in the ratio of gross national product to budget from  in the year  to  in the year  a step backwards
this clearly illustrates that the budget of the european union is worth its weight in gold
the european union acquired a new remit following the war in kosovo and the resolutions on the stability pact in the balkans
the council stressed the importance of this remit once again in lisbon
eur  million have been earmarked for aid to the western balkans in  following on from eur  million this year
is expenditure of eur  million for the entire region too high an estimate
we have already discussed whether these countries are able to absorb this figure in the trialogue debate with the council
i should point out that the proposal for serbia for the year  makes provision for a fixed sum of  million
now we can see at a glance how much is being spent on which political areas
i think that abb ie this proposal this new structure will really make public political debate much easier
what is the european union spending its money on
this is therefore a very important step not a technical step but an important political step
more importantly it also includes a whole series of technical adjustments and in particular the consequences of the annual accounts for  for the european union budget
the european union budget for  closed with a large surplus of eur  billion
in other words eur  billion will be refunded to the member states
these refunds will be offset against the contributions for this year
there was some confusion in relation to great britain in the report
so we need to take a good look at the question of exchange rates in the european budget
of course this will be followed by intensive debate
mr president commissioner thank you for your presentation i should like to pick up straight away on your closing words
i do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the budget 
the debate and the budgets which we have voted in the past demonstrate this and that is the way it should stay
allow me to remind the house agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to rise by 
on the face of it these relative figures alone ie the percentages are highly satisfactory
this may take account of the wishes of the council and of council s decisions but it does not take quite such good account of the wishes of parliament
nevertheless you want to increase this expenditure by  and research expenditure accounts for over  of category 
so far so good
we can support that
but what about parliament s priorities
that is perfectly normal and we have supported that
if you look at the culture and audiovisual media heading there is a  increase
i would have expected it to be higher information and communications have risen by 
but what about social dialogue and employment  down 
what about energy policy which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again
you have cut it by  and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 
to my mind the preliminary draft budget as it now stands takes no account of parliament s priorities
we urgently need to discuss this so that the budget also clearly sets out our priorities
you wrote to us last december saying that a proposal would be submitted in the middle of april
we are all dying to see it
thank you mrs haug
remember that you will have many months ahead to discuss this matter and to speak at length
furthermore this is simply a dream on the part of the commission
the serious discussion will begin in july with the council s draft
i know we should not do so but there is that link between the two which makes me want to comment on both
for the commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial
the first is the assessment of needs for the western balkans
in a couple of weeks time parliament will send an ad hoc delegation to kosovo to try and make an assessment
that is why i say they have to be linked
i will give you an example
one area of great interest for me  i make no secret of it  is south africa
the proposal to take eur  million per year away from south africa for six years may not seem much
but eur  million is a lot of money for the projects in south africa
once again that would be a challenge for parliament
the third factor and probably the most important one is the attitude of the council
if they reject what you are proposing especially as far as the revision goes the question remains what will you do next
what happens if the council is adamant and rejects the commission s proposals
mrs schreyer you are something of a juggler and an illusionist at the same time with the proposals that have been made
one of the great mysteries in your proposals on the revision is where the money will come from after 
but that is not for next year
that is for the future
in the meantime we await developments on those three factors
hopefully at the end of this process we will get a satisfactory outcome
protecting the communities financial interests and the fight against fraud
mr dell alba has the floor on a point of order
mr president i should like to ask a preliminary question pursuant to rule 
according to my rights under the rules of procedure i should like my preliminary question which is a question of principle to be put to the vote
the committee on budgetary control must stop meddling wholesale as has been the case recently with the subject areas of other committees
we have seen rapporteurs particularly mrs theato obstructing documents outside their own area of competence for weeks at a time
some of us are starting to become annoyed
in this specific instance i move that this report be deemed inadmissible and that we move on to the report which is the next item on the agenda
i request that this be put to the vote
thank you mr dell alba
such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately
mrs theato are you speaking against mr dell alba s motion
i would have expected such matters to be clarified in committee rather than here in plenary
secondly i would be obliged if mr dell alba could tell me what he means by saying that i have blocked documents for weeks
i fail to understand mr dell alba s choice of words and assertion and i would welcome an explanation
as no one wishes to speak for the motion the vote shall now take place
parliament rejected the motion
i welcome this judgement
that was my position from the outset incidentally
unfortunately the committee on constitutional affairs did not subscribe to this view
i said from the outset that members offices were off limits for olaf
obviously the commission s legal service took a different view
now it has been taught a lesson by the court
however the court judgement has put us in a position of inequality because only the plaintiff can cite this judgement
this state of affairs may last for a ridiculous amount of time perhaps until a judgement is returned on the main issue which may not be for two years
i have therefore taken recourse to rule  of the rules of procedure and proposed an amendment to the rules of procedure
the text which i have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the committee on budgetary control
i urge you to support this initiative to amend the rules of procedure
if the proposed amendment to the rules of procedure is implemented their action would as a matter of course be pointless anyway
i totally fail to understand that we have no intention of interfering in the banks work
they certainly would not have done so if they had felt that their independence was being jeopardised
three points on the content of my report
point number  concerns olaf as an investigation unit which identifies and investigates suspicious cases quickly and efficiently
the legal basis for this is in place
together with the council we have done everything within our power
the development of olaf is well under way
point number  concerns really effective disciplinary procedures
this provision has never been applied
the commission is planning even now to delete it from the financial regulation
that would be precisely the wrong signal
we urge the commission to reconsider such a move
what is wrong with the present disciplinary procedures is that of necessity they lead to huge conflicts of interest
that cannot work and it does not work
as long as this system is maintained the accusation will be made time and again rightly or wrongly that proceedings are open to manipulation
the report also includes a number of points from the white paper on the reform of the commission in connection with olaf
except that the commission wants to implement all the points addressed here before the summer recess
if we do not take a stand on them now then we can spare ourselves the trouble altogether
i can only urge you to stand by your own decisions and not create difficulties where none exists
applause
the eu budget however is largely administered within the member states and this is where huge potential for fraud exists
first was the issue of definition
the second point that i want to make is about the commitment of member states to deal with fraud
the fact of the matter is that member states have a high responsibility here
my final point concerns the accession countries
we must demand that the accession countries also endeavour to work in conjunction with the european union and to the highest standards
in the past  as we are now all aware  there have been irregularities within the commission
this opens the door to fraud
just think of the example of the collection of value added tax
under no circumstances should olaf become nothing more than a help desk
olaf is not one of your broadcasts for diy enthusiasts along the lines of how can we build a model railway
i would like this financial instrument to have an additional name such as prosecutor a broadshouldered european financial prosecutor
i would remind you at this point that parliament called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline in its resolution of  january
the immunity of members for example will of course continue to be protected
i call on the intergovernmental conference to take our concerns on board
we are fighting here for technical measures which hopefully will not turn into a longrunning saga
we must concentrate once again on european values so that for example our money is not misappropriated for the drawing up of military measures
i know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person
but that is where our efforts should be concentrated
because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness
 pt mr president the current year is the first in which olaf is fully operational
according to the court of auditors the gap between actual receipts and their theoretical amount is eur  thousand million
mr president i too would like to start by congratulating mr bosch on his relentless efforts to turn olaf into a success
there are many points in the present resolution which the liberal group can endorse
we would call on the commission to submit proposals to this effect as soon as possible
also the date mentioned in the report is important in our opinion
in our opinion it is important that this task is taken from the commission so as to take away any semblance of nepotism and such like
olaf starts its first full working year this year
we will all have to wait and see what the outcome of that will be
expectations are naturally very high
one aspect however could be improved on namely the supervisory committee as mr bosch calls it in his report
everyone has a right to a defence including those who need to be investigated by olaf
we must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible
i would call on the commission to submit proposals to this effect too
the liberal group is of the opinion that this should clearly be the case as these are european institutions too
they cannot remain outside olaf s general scope of investigation
we support the commission so as to make this possible
this anomaly must be resolved without delay
the structural funds are gaining in importance all the time and form a large area of investigation for olaf and the commission
on my own behalf i will therefore stick my neck out and endorse all paragraphs of the bosch report which call for the setting up of a european public prosecutor s office
i know it is a controversial issue even within my own group
despite this i believe that such a european public prosecutor s office should be set up
fraud is a scourge as far as the eu is concerned
i do not know how large a percentage of the member states budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities
we think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level
the other paragraphs are about something completely different
my criticism of the bosch report then is the very simple reason that we have other instruments
a situation whereby the committee on budgetary control s many reports keep bringing up the same subject is not normal
let us take the proposal for an independent prosecutor
mrs theato attempted to have this adopted as a legislative initiative
she did not succeed
the committee on budgetary control tried to do so and parliament rejected it
this is not a proposal for a legislative initiative
what then is the point of harping on all the time about something which is obviously a problem area
even though the fraud problem primarily affects the member states you wish to set up a special court ad hoc courts
you know mr bosch in the past in italy and other countries they had special courts
probably in your own country too and these were not exactly models of democracy
so i would adopt a more cautious approach
i think this report is a waste of a lot of paper
what is more many of the amendments seek to remove paragraphs
mr president mr bosch has prepared a good report on protection against fraud
what are we not allowed to see
what is the ombudsman not allowed to see
when will we be given a complete overview of all the committees and working parties together with their members
will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds
lack of transparency is the fraudsters best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters
in olaf s judgement it appears that it is not in the structural funds that fraud and bad management prevail
it is other expenditure that we should be concerned about
finally we should not duplicate responsibilities
i therefore believe that we should clearly separate objectives and not allow confusion to reign
mr president i would like to join the many speakers who have congratulated mr bosch on his report
i would like to distance myself somewhat from what mr mulder said on this score
the steps required to fight fraud have been mentioned on countless occasions including today
i would like to highlight two
firstly there are still member states that have not signed the convention on the protection of the financial interests of the eu
the ppede group had better have a good explanation for this
we have made a new start with the independent olaf
mr president my last point concerns the european parliament itself
i regret that the court has reached this decision and hope that it will arrive at a different decision in the final ruling
ladies and gentlemen this report is an excellent illustration of what should be done and what should not be done
this principle has been emphasised all the more by the revelation of inefficiencies within the community institutions
in order to do so we must focus on the effectiveness of the procedures set in place particularly under olaf
so i beg you please do not try for ideological reasons to come and complicate matters adding yet more structures and procedures
this is the reason why we are not in favour of creating a european public prosecutor s office
we must be able to have confidence in relying on the national structures
in fact the proposal to create a european public prosecutor s department is unacceptable since this requires us to be effective immediately
from the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud these creations are no more than fresh grounds for sterile conflicts
in conclusion i feel that the commission s watchwords must be rigour discipline and proper collaboration
no other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at european level
this is why the bosch report deserves particular attention and support
allow me to congratulate you on this report
organised crime has identified the institutions of the european union as a particularly easy target
i am delighted that both the commission and parliament have included this question in the intergovernmental conference
the committee on budgetary control has gone one step further in this report
i require an answer and i should like it recorded in the minutes
mrs theato you know perfectly well what i am talking about
the matter was discussed at length in the conference of presidents
one group chairman even left the room on an occasion when the matter came up on the agenda one day
do not pretend that you know nothing you know perfectly well what happened
that is the truth of the matter
that has now been cleared up
we must address the lack of moral responsibility on the part of bureaucracies which was condemned in such a masterly way by kafka
the immunity which we enjoy as meps must not be confused with impunity
mr president i have to depart a little bit from what i intended to say
i heard mr van hulten s reference to the fact that olaf should have the right to investigate members of parliament
he has a point and a minority of people in this parliament agree with that
in the end olaf might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted
we should not throw staff money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist
those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem
mr bosch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs
i do not agree with all of his report
reform of the commission is now under way
mr kinnock has submitted a timetable and it is now up to us to applaud it i am very impressed with the reform plan
in general it is both visionary and realistic
there are nonetheless a number of sticking points and these are what we ought to draw attention to and criticise
this idea is one we should stick to i think
if such a body were to be established this would mean that disciplinary matters would be taken away from the commission
we have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils
that is indefensible
both the echo and med cases are all too wellknown examples of this state of affairs
i also agree with the rapporteur when he criticises setting up an advisory panel to deal with irregularities
we have of course established olaf to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities
another panel would serve only to undermine olaf s powers
i cannot however vote in favour of setting up a european public prosecutor s office
in actual fact there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform
it is for all that only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences
ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence
instead there is a need for public internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people
we need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure as also proposed in the report
i would also point out that i had three minutes in which to speak
i spoke for only two but i am very disciplined
i am happy to let someone else use my time
you should also of course be allowed to make mistakes from time to time
mr blak allow me to apologise officially
you are quite right you had three minutes
i was not wearing my glasses
do you wish to add anything else
no
well that puts the friendship between denmark and bavaria back on terra firma
thank you mr blak for overlooking my error
mr president this is just the sort of issue which gives rise to lofty declarations
but i should like to go into a few points which as far as i am concerned are relatively unclear
i think we need to amend and clarify the basis of the matters about which we are talking
problem number two of course further investigation may show that some financial irregularities are in fact cases of fraud
mr president i also congratulate mr bosch on his report
he is the acknowledged expert within the european parliament and to a large extent was the architect of the new olaf
one thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the eu is big stories about fraud
they always get big coverage
that is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable
the figure that is being attached to it is about  of the eu budget
to give you an example a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly
that is not to say that he means to defraud
it may be that he measured his land incorrectly
and then there are the big fraudsters the people who for example import cigarettes illegally avoiding tax
there is a huge difference between these two things
we need to have them distinguished much more clearly
let us not forget that  of the fraud takes place within member states
yesterday the commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 
we want to know whether the member states will follow that lead
it is clear that a lot of the problems lie there in particular with the structural funds
it is about time they signed up
they have had five years to do it
let us see them ratify it
when we talk of the court of auditors report this covers the whole spectrum of financial irregularities
mr blak stated in his speech that the citizens of the european union are sick and tired of fraud
as a result such a move cannot be reconciled with the present treaties
article  of the amsterdam treaty also makes this clear
i should like to thank all the speakers who wrote home calling for the necessary steps to be taken at long last
a conference on this subject is to be held in ancona at the end of the week
in poland for example it has been decided to set up a polish olaf
the member states have indicated that they will not amend the treaty in this area
i should like to comment briefly on the complaints filed by the commission against the european central bank and the european investment bank
unfortunately neither bank has made a move over recent weeks
not that this was ever disputed for the european central bank
i think that the new director of olaf defends this view very vigorously including in a personal capacity
we shall have the opportunity of debating other reports on the subject of fighting fraud this year
the olaf supervisory committee which monitors the independence of olaf will soon submit its report which we shall also have the opportunity to debate
i should point out that the commission is currently working on a fundamental strategy paper on the fight against fraud
this too will certainly lead to further intensive and fruitful debate
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place today at  noon
the sitting was suspended at  am and resumed at  pm
vote
however for some technical reason the services did not receive it
the services have however said that we have a tightlypacked voting programme tomorrow so that it would perhaps make sense to vote today
we would be happy to vote
the vote is not the problem the problem is that you did not receive the motion for a split vote in time
in parliament we have certain rules that are applicable to everyone
they must be observed and i cannot make any exceptions
i must be frank and tell you that even though i appreciate the problem
we shall then proceed to the vote unless you are going to propose postponing the vote which is a proposal i would of course put to the vote
madam president in that case  i understand your position  i should like to move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow or thursday
i would like to hear the opinion of our rapporteur mrs schierhuber
madam president i am sorry that the socialists voting list was not received by the services in time
unfortunately if we vote tomorrow it will be too late
mrs schierhuber let us be clear on this
you have just expressed your view to the effect that you prefer to have the vote today
parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote
following the vote on legislative proposal no  and adoption of the commission proposal as amended
mrs schreyer can you give our rapporteur an answer in the affirmative
mrs schierhuber the commission has not changed its opinion
the commission presented this proposal as the outcome of experience in past years

our rapporteur mrs schierhuber proposes referral to committee
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of referral to committee
madam president i should like to speak for the motion
the groups have agreed that this is the only way of exerting any influence
we must prevent this and parliament and the commission must join in the discussion to find a compromise
madam president exactly the same applies to this second decision as what you said for the first decision
two proposed amendments in this second file are of fundamental importance to the committee on agriculture namely amendments nos  and 
i therefore again ask the commission if it has perhaps revised its opinion here
madam president my colleague mr fischler made a statement on this yesterday
the commission has not changed its position
madam president in that case may i again ask the house to vote to refer the report back to committee
parliament decided to refer the second part of the report to committee
parliament adopted the resolutionexplanations of votes
rothley report a
i was the victim of a road accident
a compromise has been reached between the institutions at a recent conciliation committee meeting which was held last march
the most complex problem concerns the directive s territorial application
this matter is now resolved
 i welcome my socialist colleague willi rothley s recommendation on protecting motorists abroad
we are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across europe
as many as   drivers in the european union are victims of road accidents abroad every year
this is   too many
every insurance company will therefore need to appoint a representative in each member state
under the compromise the directive will apply to such accidents in a certain number of countries outside the european union
for my own constituents and for all of europe s citizens i give the green light to this proposal
martinez martinez report a
we should take this into account whenever we provide aid to any third countries including south africa
madam president the situation in south africa is difficult  and it is by no means an easy country to run
yet south africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent
we should therefore be doing everything possible to assist the economic social and democratic development of that country
eur  million is not an insignificant sum of money in south african terms
in terms of the european budget it is not something we would struggle to find
thank you mr martin
thank you mrs cauquil
i am given to understand that mrs laguiller and mrs bordes are also involved in the explanation of vote that you have just given
jeggle report a
this measure deals once again with the european union s common agricultural policy
in future we must pay more attention to the needs of elderly familybased farmers
the planned reduction in the monthly increments would therefore clearly be breaking our promise to the farmers
given the worrying economic situation of the rural population further erosion of their income is unjustifiable
the income of people working in farming has fallen by a total of nearly  in real terms since 
a reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers
 sv a transformation of agricultural policy is a prerequisite for enlargement of the european union
because the report opposes a reduction in the intervention price of cereal we are voting against the committee s proposal

 da agricultural aid is a heavy burden for the european union
we are forced to reduce aid to the absolute minimum and we should have the discussion now
aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons
schierhuber report a
madam president i voted against this measure on the european policy on flax and hemp
basically we must start to change the way we provide aid to agriculture in europe
madam president ladies and gentlemen i voted in favour of mrs schierhuber s report
i consider proposed amendments nos  and  to be particularly important
she rightly points out that any limitation on maximum quantities must correlate with actual processing capacities
introducing national maximum quantities as proposed by the commission would create a system which fails to take account of national processing capacities
the  tonne per annum limitation would exclude many member states from cultivation in advance

it is therefore difficult to guarantee that there is no cultivation of hemp for the purpose of manufacturing drugs

if parliament is serious about eastward enlargement there must be a drive extensively to cut back on the costs of agriculture
all direct forms of support for agricultural production ought gradually to be abolished
bosch report a
this is not because i do not approve of fighting all types of fraud  of course i do
the same report states that these eur   million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the iceberg
it is absolutely essential that we change the way we spend our money
madam president you have just congratulated the rapporteur on his work
these particularly concerned all the sections to do with the white paper
consequently many amendments which went beyond the report and the content of the report that mr bosch was supposed to be drawing up have been dropped
all honour and tribute then to the wisdom of this parliament for restoring order
 da we have voted today in favour of mr bosch s report on the more effective combating of fraud and irregularities involving eu resources
mr kinnock s reform plan is on the whole both visionary and realistic there are however a few sticking points
if such a body were to be established this would mean that disciplinary procedures would be taken away from the commission
we have had a lot of bad experiences with the internal disciplinary council
that is indefensible
both the echo and med cases are all too wellknown examples of this state of affairs
we ought likewise to criticise the proposal in the white paper to the effect that an advisory panel should be set up to deal with irregularities
we have established olaf to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities
another panel would serve only to undermine olaf s powers
in actual fact there is more need for a fundamental staffing reform
it is for all that only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences
ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence
instead there is a need for public internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people
we need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure as also proposed in the report
we were also unhappy with the references to vat made within the report
 fr i abstained from the vote on the resolution on protecting the communities financial interests and the fight against fraud
i did not vote however because of the establishment of a new control body
the community is not going to achieve the desired goal by creating a tangled multiplicity of such bodies
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
we have a report here before us which the commission promised together with its final report on the  bse report at parliament s request
it has now presented it
the committee on agriculture and rural development and mr boge have drafted opinions on it
in other words we have been able to keep the bse team going well
so far you have presented no proposal on this
here too we need to take the member states to task more
here too i repeat mistrust is always shown of the member states including my own and rightly so
i am convinced of the need for the commission to make proposals in order to close any loopholes in current legislation
but you have said that you have a problem with cat food
please say something about the risk of infection from cats
mrs attwooll and others have proposed a number of amendments specifically amendments nos   and 
for example no distinction is made between breeding and fattening that is a completely inadequate proposal
allow me to repeat quite clearly the repercussions on the member states have obviously been overestimated by some members in the house
mr president i shall have another three minutes at the end of the debate which i shall use to comment on some of the interventions by the honourable members
i should also like expressly to praise the excellent collaboration between the committees and the rapporteurs
even scientists have so far avoided committing themselves on this point
that is why the compensation paid by the commission to beneficiaries must be quite substantial
commissioner byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer
this would cost a great deal of money
it would not remove a single additional suspect case of bse
i sincerely hope so
mr president i would first of all address the commissioner and say that i naturally welcome the present proposal
secondly i want to congratulate mrs rothbehrendt on a very good piece of work
i also want to thank mr boge
i wish to support in principle all the amendments from the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection
nowadays we know a very great deal indeed about the living world
life is not however complete as it were but is evolving all the time
it is evolving not only in a positive way but also in a negative way
as time goes on we are faced with new viruses and new problems
the bse crisis is an example of such a phenomenon
there are however also many more examples
there are therefore two things which must be done
we must make sure that the situation does not occur again
however we must also find ways of overcoming similar tragedies in the future
such tragedies will clearly not occur in precisely this area but will crop up elsewhere
we must have the same rules monitored in the same way
everyone must be treated the same
i am thinking of the last intervention
the united kingdom has been affected badly
i can well understand why people there have points of view as to how it might perhaps be possible to make savings
that would mean our becoming unclear and sending out false signals
i would like to expressly congratulate mrs rothbehrendt on her report
my group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you
we give you our full support and have every confidence in you
after all the proposal follows on from a pledge which was made previously regarding the followup committee
this is therefore to be welcomed
i would like to home in on the following issues
firstly it makes sense to include regionalisation and regional differentiation in the goaloriented fight against tse
if you are in any doubt about this just ask my scottish and welsh colleagues
secondly there are tests for a rapid diagnosis and to identify tse in cattle
i believe that these tests are at least heading in the right direction and that we should support the scientific research carried out in this field
thirdly i welcome the requirement to destroy or remove the entire herd on farms where the disease has broken out
i think that it is important to bring about more democracy to get away from comitology and to increase parliamentary control
these are cardinal amendments to my mind
this is why this proposal needs to be changed particularly where it specifies classifying countries into categories
it would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties
the conclusion which we draw from this draft regulation is that it is probably an attempt to cover up the situation
we therefore oppose the commission proposal
this house must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated
for my country ireland food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers
so now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since  ie for fourteen years
it is rather late in the day to react but even so over the last fourteen years we have done a great deal last month for example we decided to stick labels on meat to warn consumers
the commission told us that it was impossible to enforce such labelling before  sixteen years after the outbreak of the disease but we have done something all the same
we have had debates topical and urgent questions on the embargo etc
the starting point for this business was the  milk quotas
bse is the tragic product of the race for profits and the british farm model
the disease has been identified since  but nothing much was done until 
why not
the public could not be thrown into a panic because the maastricht treaty had to be sold to them
so the press the commission and the european parliament all knew about it but did not say a word
why
so met first with silence and then with lies the epidemic spread and we all know what the outcome of that was
in the first place bse has not been eradicated in great britain and will not be eradicated
secondly the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination
thirdly either contamination crossed over to the meal fed to poultry or there is a third transmission route
fourthly great britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not as polluters paid
it is innocent farmers grain farmers who are paying the price in the same way that the farmers are paying for kosovo
all in all then the directive and the regulation are all well and good but they are somewhat hypocritical
in the bse crisis at the moment of truth when protective action had to be taken it was taken by the national states
that is the main lesson to be learnt from the tse business
firstly protection is always led by the states
secondly the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations
this is no obstacle to the construction of europe but like children making tree houses it is just a game
that is what we are doing here mr president all playing out together
consumer welfare demands that we use every means possible to prevent and vigorously combat these diseases and their vectors
the action taken in  is now proving even more inadequate as scientists are today talking about a third transmission route
finally the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected
the development of common guidelines should allow firmer more balanced and therefore more effective responses
the objective is to gather into one dossier all regulations relating to tses to date
if we are to restore consumer confidence it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels
mr boge for his part has ensured that these views will gain wide support in this chamber
she will appreciate even better than i how far scientific opinion on tses has developed
similarly certain measures in combating tses have already proved effective
while accepting that some member states may wish to engage in the practice i would submit that it should not be compulsory
indeed we take tse and bse very seriously in the united kingdom
we are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare
this twofold concern seems to be particularly justified today as french experience shows
medical and scientific uncertainty still prevails
in these circumstances the precautionary principle must be adopted to the full
the development of bse in france raises issues that are not purely medical in the narrowest sense
this is nothing new
no public health policy should ignore these factors
they are however discussed only on rare occasions and in little detail by the european institutions including parliament
i can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls
we already have enough and i believe they are adequate and effective
this proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry
of course i have no objections to other countries adopting measures which match ours
in fact it would be helpful if measures already in place in the uk were implemented throughout the eu and elsewhere
thus it is not new laws we need  we need more compliance
in any case if more controls were needed we should not be looking to the commission for guidance
we should wait to see what this inquiry says
her approach and hence her report is one we can wholeheartedly support
i think it essential in this case to define suspect animals quite apart from the age criterion
the important thing then is to have systematic recourse to testing whenever an animal dies of unknown causes
systematic testing precludes fraud and makes it possible to offer better guarantees
the issue of slaughtering herds has been discussed at length
in both france and germany the whole herd is slaughtered if a single animal is found to be diseased
but is it possible to put the argument of the costs of destroying a herd when a public health issue is involved
i think this is not a tenable position
it is important for the regulations of the various countries of the european union to be harmonised
i should finally like to talk about atrisk materials these notorious substances which may present risks
so this regulation is a good one
it represents some progress but it is capable of being perfected rather than perfect as it stands
it does not raise any questions concerning the incineration of animalbased meal
i think commissioner that these are questions we also have to ask
mr president i asked to be allowed to speak again at the end of the debate  we are not quite at the end
allow me to say a few words on the debate
allow me therefore to say a few words on some of the points raised yes mr trakatellis and others are right mr staes
we still have no tests for live animals
of course we need that
we are not legislating just for great britain
i am the first to recognise what great britain has achieved and at what price to farmers
i have spoken to countless officials and farmers representatives in great britain over recent years and i know that
which is why i believe that this regulation is a good regulation
i will be the first to support it
but i do not want this to be rushed as is the case with certain proposed amendments
this particularly applies to proposed amendment no  to which mrs attwooll referred
what must the member state do to qualify
mr president at the outset i would like to add my thanks to mrs rothberendt and indeed mr boge for their commitment to this important issue
the proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals
the principle of this approach cannot be faulted
having discussed this with mrs rothberendt we have tabled amendment no  to article  as a compromise to this effect
i welcome the principle of laying down common rules for the prevention and control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
however this proposal may have negative consequences for countries trading in sheep and this is an important point as it currently stands
i make no case for leniency of treatment at all
the uk would be in class  ireland would be in class  under either classification system the ssc or the oie
the united kingdom already has comprehensive and effective measures in place to protect human health and eradicate bse in our herd
this is working
cases of bse are declining rapidly
but most importantly so far we have not had a case in an animal born since the complete feed ban was introduced
that should be happening around about now if it was going to
no older animals over  months of age enter the food chain
very large numbers of animals die of natural causes or common ailments
bse is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway
this could well result in the underreporting of cases as we have seen in switzerland recently
bse is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally
wholeherd slaughter has no scientific justification
the majority of herds that have experienced bse in the uk have had only one or two isolated cases
most herds in britain are not closed herds and therefore animals come in from all over the place
if one of those animals gets a disease why kill the whole herd
wholeherd slaughter is not an effective way of reducing cases of bse
it would cost a small fortune for no tangible benefit
mr president i will omit replying to that particular remark
with respect to mr martinez i will only say one word to him  sludge
i will say no more as far as that is concerned
however whatever we do we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened
that would be a drastic approach
one other point where i come from in recent years there has been a continuing downward trend
that is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the united kingdom
mr president i would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report
both issues are important but we must be able to show clearly the priority of values public health comes first
one important aspect of this view is the wholeherd slaughter on a farm where disease has been discovered
even without knowledge of whether any of the other animals have become infected this action is nevertheless justifiable precisely in order for the above objectives to be met
at the same time we must of course ensure that the breeder receives proper compensation for his livestock
this objective has now been met in the committee report  in a slightly different but nevertheless satisfactory manner
contrary to the commission s proposal the report refers to instant tests which are being used to detect tse by name
this in itself is acceptable but we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a technology which is continually being developed
i wish to begin by thanking you for the excellent cooperation between your assistants and my services
due to this thorough preparation i am in a position today to agree in full or in part to almost threequarters of your proposed amendments
that is an issue which i have referred to before
i should like especially to thank mrs rothbehrendt and mr boge for their huge contribution to this proposal
i can think of no other individuals who have made such a positive contribution to tackling bse
they have both rendered an enormous service to the health protection of europe s citizens
i turn now to the specific amendments and formal commission position
firstly on commitology we accept amendments nos           and 
with regard to the recitals i also accept amendments nos   and 
with regard to the articles themselves firstly the scope i accept amendments nos  and 
with regard to definitions i can partly accept amendments no  to article  on the definition of tse suspected animals
but the inclusion of fallen cattle sheep and goats in the definition cannot be accepted
it is not practicable to collect incinerate and carry out a full epidemiological investigation on each fallen animal
however i accept amendment no 
with regard to classification bse status i accept amendments nos    and 
let me add however in passing that we will keep under constant review the scope for increased testing of animals for bse
i happen to believe that it is essential to maintain the flexibility of the commitology procedure
that is the advice i have been given
i also welcome amendments nos   and  to annex iv
on feed ban i accept amendments nos  and 
i also partly accept amendment no  to annex v laying down the detailed rules on the extended feed ban
i identify cats here in particular
that is the advice i have been given in relation to cats
i can partly accept amendment no  to annex v where it exempts gelatine from hides from the ban
however i cannot accept the exemption for feeding cats with ruminant protein from the ban
on disease eradication i accept amendments nos  and 
i also welcome amendment no  to article  but propose to reformulate providing for regular rather than immediate notification
i cannot accept the second part of this amendment as it is in fact superfluous
i can partly accept amendment no  on condition that the equivalent measures are approved on a casebycase basis under commitology
i should add that adns regions are too small and too difficult to control
on the conditions for marketing animals we welcome the intention of amendment no  to article 
however i propose to reformulate the text to ensure approval of the equivalent schemes by commitology
i cannot accept amendment no  to annex viii reducing the protection measures against scrapie
finally on laboratory techniques i accept amendments nos  and 
thank you again for your cooperation
i sincerely hope that this will continue to be a hugely important proposal and that we shall continue our cooperation on it
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
organisation of working time
as president for today s sitting it is my honour to inaugurate a new procedure
mrs smet our rapporteur was president of the council of ministers when the original working time directive was enacted
mr rocard is a former very wellknown french minister and indeed prime minister
the delegation also had a great responsibility in this negotiation because we had many difficult decisions to take
indeed we finished up with a nineyear period
only in extreme circumstances will governments be able to go through a procedure to justify an extension of that period of nine years
as many people will be aware today many junior doctors are working  hours in some countries
we see that the junior doctors are in fact going to get a great benefit from this extension to the directive
we also were able to clarify the position regarding the classification of mobile workers
that i think was another major achievement for parliament in this negotiation
thank you mr provan
i think we can in fact thank all the members of parliament that were involved in this conciliation procedure
my thanks go to all of you
this has already happened in the case of road transport
the european parliament has made its position clear but it appears that the council is unable to adopt the common position
i would call on the council and both sides of industry finally to resolve this matter
fortunately agreements have now been concluded within aviation navigation at sea and also rail transport which have been translated into directives
exemptions are only possible under a collective labour agreement or following consultation involving both sides of industry
the reason why they want to have an extended transitional period and the decision which is eventually taken have to be published in the eu s official journal
but at the time it appeared impossible for the council to draw up a directive which covered all employees in all sectors and activities
hence the commission proposed to take a separate and additional initiative for the benefit of those sectors and activities which were excluded from the council s directive
that culminated in the  white paper and the  consultation paper and communication
the power of codecision proved to be decisive
in this case we managed to keep the procedure within bounds
mr president as british conservatives we have always opposed the working time directive
we very much hoped that this would pressure national governments  especially our own  to produce a better deal
certainly parliament as a whole was of similar mind hence the conciliation committee on which i was privileged to serve
i should briefly like to mention a point made by some of my colleagues from that delegation
i hope other nationals will forgive me if i mention only other british colleagues for a reason that will become apparent
the first speaker in the main meeting was mr hughes
one of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention
certainly it was meant to be
that will not have strengthened our case
it may or may not have made any difference but certainly it will not have done the parliamentary delegation any good service
a few weeks later we did the best that we could
it will be presented  as you president have already presented it  as nine years
but it is as you know nine years plus two years plus one year
the uk government will add that up to twelve years as against the  years which the uk government was asking for initially
there are three main issues which i would like to concentrate on in the brief time available to me
thanks to conciliation collective agreement will now need to be the route for an extension to annualisation
that was an important point of progress
the second point concerns seafishing
that can be subject to derogation but again only after attempts to broker collective agreements to involve the social partners
looking at this part of the agreement without detailed knowledge of the negotiations that went into it it must seem like a very strange animal
a fouryear transposition period  five years transition and then the possibility of extra time beyond that
but of course that was to take account of the special difficulties facing one or two member states
i would repeat what other speakers have said for us the period in question is nine years
that will be the normal period within which member states will be expected to comply with the requirements of this directive in relation to junior doctors
i am confident speaking today that will be the case
a further important point might have been missed
the provisions relating to nine years for junior doctors only relate to the average working week
the final point i would like to make relates to the transport dossier
it is very important that we get movement in that area in the transport council
maybe the commissioner has some news for us today
the agreement will not be implemented in the near future at national level
i would agree with philip bushillmatthews as well
i think the strength of having allparty support throughout the uk on our delegation was very very useful
i would like to talk specifically about junior doctors
i am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive
there are   junior doctors across the eu who will be affected by this
 in my constituency work over  hours a week as do   in the uk as a whole
the present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike  they have our life in their hands
we would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and i do not believe that we should be treated by an overtired doctor
evidence proves that somebody who is impaired by tiredness is impaired in the same way as drunkenness
a lot of those were going to australia and new zealand where the working practices were better
we have to stop that drain
the nineyear timetable of course is an improvement on what the council of ministers wanted
it is far better than what the council wanted which was the year period
i of course would have preferred a shorter time
as i have said before our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right
the uk government of course was part of the problem
they maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale
but as everyone else has said it has to be in exceptional circumstances
it is not twelve years  it is nine years and we must state that very very clearly
it is long enough  i would have liked it to have been shorter but let us hope the governments and the british government in particular adhere to that
mr president i must apologise for this appearing to be a british show at this moment
i assure you that it does change with the next speaker
i also would like to thank mrs smet our rapporteur for the excellent work that she has done throughout this entire process
i speak as my group s representative on that parliamentary delegation and i know what i have seen
this is a health and safety issue as has been said for both the workers concerned and for the public
i consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action
that would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains
i would like to congratulate in advance those member states that will meet their obligations under this directive for all sectors
the progress of others will be monitored very carefully
i also want to thank other key people such as mr provan and mr rocard
they have played an important role
it was of course important to solve problems
the idea was that seven million people should be brought within the scope of the directive
i wanted to make the point that in spite of everything i was not satisfied with everything in this compromise
i was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors
this is really little different from the council s position involving thirteen years
there was therefore not so much of a compromise on that particular point
young doctors do not choose these working conditions and working hours but are forced to accept them
naturally we hope that in reality the process will be still more rapid
i hope that this will continue
it is not just a question of establishing longest permitted working times but of a good deal else besides
there are ever more differences in the way in which working time is distributed in our society
working time puts the squeeze on women and children in particular
young and old have different needs and different abilities
mr president i join in the congratulations to all involved with this matter
rather than reiterate what other colleagues have said i think the core issue is the junior doctors in training
in addition as mr hughes pointed out the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately
i shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive
firstly concerning fishermen there is some attempt to compromise within the proposals before us
perhaps we should review this at some stage in the near future and look at it anew to try to come up with a better solution
perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh
it will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the union
finally i wish to pay my compliments once again to mrs smet
i have one small further request to the commissioner
i would like also to extend warm thanks to the commission particularly for their declaration on working on sundays
this was a major obstacle for us mainly because the commission had skirted this thorny issue a little too easily in the past
the declaration was therefore a great help to us
i would like to say one thing to the representatives of the guengl group and the greens
the first problem was that they appeared unable to train a sufficient number of doctors
if therefore you do not train sufficient doctors you need to obtain them from other countries
if this plan fails too then the whole procedure could take a very long time
that is the problem
i have one question for the commission it concerns the other matters at issue specifically that of transport
i would like to know how the commission intends to deal with this
it is now up to the commission
the working time directive will not be complete until these issues have been resolved
the ball is now quite clearly in the commission s court
the transport council is behaving badly
i wonder if the commission can think of a way to resolve this
more of this later
that makes it all the easier to bring this directive about
he  more than anyone  should be in our thoughts when dealing with this subject matter
this is demonstrated by the excellent work of mrs smet and also mr provan and mr rocard
however we should not be dazzled by the light
they may have requested this additional period but we should take great care to ensure that they do not use it
like my colleague mrs lambert i am concerned that this compromise has not gone quite far enough in relation to doctors hours
there would remain though some workers in some working places where practical issues do not readily lend themselves to the implementation of this type of directive
this may be an improvement but i still have some questions to put to the commission
we have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector
the directive says that work at sea comprises sea fishing and other offshore work
they are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand
is this directive going to affect them or is it not
i call for a similar exception for sharefishermen
the only exception made concerns junior doctors for whom the period is extended from four to nine and possibly to twelve years apart from anything else this also threatens the safety of the patients themselves who are examined by doctors who work excessively long hours
that is why we have voted against this agreement since what we want of course is a better agreement
the most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation
hence the conciliation procedure which you mr president were involved in
i do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later
when used preventively it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money
one does not exclude the other
we also need a framework directive because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now
we know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcoholrelated problems
parliament has shown sufficient flexibility mrs smet highlighted our legislative maturity
i think mrs smet you have proven that we can also fight
the results are acceptable
i am trying to muster support even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to
but the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the council
directive  was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned
it does not harmonise social legislation upwards quite the opposite
what is more a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence
it makes flexibility more widespread particularly for sea fishermen establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods
it will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of  hours per week
proper organisation of working time would entail we reiterate a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs
we cannot support this report as it stands
however to get a hour week junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years
i will not pretend to be happy with this situation
it is however the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the council s delaying tactics
it has been obvious since  that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection
in ireland some junior doctors work over  hours per week the average being  to 
in some cases they were not paid at all in some cases only half the normal rate
some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard
through the council of ministers both britain and ireland fought toothandnail to slow the process down
that was unfortunate
the same question arises with at least as much urgency for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers
what we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours
well the proposal does intend to cut hours but by phasing in the cuts
for the first three years hour working weeks are permitted
some restriction even a derisory cut in working hours is better than no restriction at all
thank heavens my fellow members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself
i shall come back to this point
we are not terribly proud of the final result but i should at least like to pay tribute to it as some outcome had to be found
at this point i should like to thank mrs smet our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur and mr provan who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our conciliation committees
it is the second following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere
this is however an infinitely more wideranging issue of course
mr president i must point out how unusually tough the council is to deal with
parliament made most of the running
we are not proud of the result in terms of the content
in a real democracy parliament would have been determining the legislation
mr president i would like first of all to make three political comments
i feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will there is a way
this was no mean feat
in my view therefore we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements
certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive
i should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue
one of the commission s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives
first i must tell you that the transport council is involved making the whole process even more complicated
the commission intends with the cooperation of the french presidency to retable the issue
we are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent
if we cannot proceed in this way we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far
with regard to the issue of fisheries the matter was raised once again by mr hudghton
we have discussed this in the past
i will try to clarify it
i am afraid i was not clear enough
so i would like to repeat that the issue of selfemployment in fisheries is not included in this directive
the selfemployed in fisheries is a matter of national competence
that is very clear and very precise
i thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions and that of your services
it is very much appreciated indeed
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
reviewing aid to third countries
the next item is the commission communication  reviewing aid to third countries
commissioner nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise
i hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle
very briefly it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is
we have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the scr over the last  years
it is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 
while our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly staff resources have failed to keep pace
the commission has  staff for every eur  million that we manage
that is an embarrassingly large figure
i do not blame the staff of the scr who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances but there are not enough of them
they have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures
we have brought forward in the document which has now been made public our proposals for dealing with this problem
we want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and where possible to national authorities in the field
we have proposed special treatment for the preaccession strategy humanitarian assistance and macrofinancial assistance with fully integrated management
that means for example transferring the residual scr functions for phare to the directorategeneral for enlargement
we have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects
we are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the court of auditors to explain our approach
we may as a result present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the  budget proposals in september
that is for the future
the simple point i want to make is this we cannot go on as we have
in my judgement it is simply not an option
we have to do better
we are not bidding for a bigger empire
the budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of european union external aid programmes
however my only aim is to put the commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently
they are the people who suffer as well as the european union s reputation
i am sure this will be a long debate
i am sure that parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months
mr president this is refreshing  the fact that the european union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions
commissioner nielson will recall that a couple of months ago i suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes
is it not the case now that this proposal taking away so much from dg development as it does is likely to make my prediction come true
i would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other commissioner
mr president i do not feel like an emperor without clothes but you can judge for yourself
we also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy
we have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined
my role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer
there are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency
one is what i have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation
the other one is the qualitysupport group which will have its secretariat in dg development
all in all i think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last july
this will also concentrate a lot of attention among all relex commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering
we have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering
what we are doing here will be part of that change
we also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem
the reality because of the way we are organised in the commission is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic
this is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now
clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable it is not possible
we have to make the point as clearly as commissioner patten just did which means that we want those resources
this is the situation as we see it
we do not want to invest our own role as commissioners in fighting a losing battle
we want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in
mr president i am very happy to hear that in order to fulfil commitments more resources and personnel are required
as parliament is aware of this we will offer our full support
however i would like to ask a question since i have not had time to study the document at length
what will happen to humanitarian aid
mr president it is a shame that mr patten had to leave so soon
i actually wanted to put my question to him
that goes without saying
i should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat
mr president i am very sorry that commissioner patten had to leave
in his absence i am delighted to direct my questions to the development commissioner mr nielson
i am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the commission is going to put into place
europeaid would be a very important attribute of the european union as far as our external relations are concerned
it has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept
microcredits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves
firstly echo is not affected by this reform of development assistance
echo is going to continue
this is clearly part of what we have decided
this is a well established discussion
we want to keep echo more or less the way it is
i have confidence that with the new director of echo we are on track
why are we saying this as clearly as we are even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat
i noticed your choice of word there
it is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other wellperforming donors
this is the message
so saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong
i realise that
but there are other elements around
we have to say it a tous azimuts
it is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear
i do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion
development ministers are not that unproblematic either
this is our biggest problem
we will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now
we are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries
we are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world
we would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned
i warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped
that is not the case
this is the goal
it will deal with private partners inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between european companies and business in the developing acp countries
this major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about
microcredit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems
however we are quite active in this field also
we should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower
thank you very much mr nielson for your optimistic view of the future
question time commission
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the commission
first part
question no  by h
what action did the commission take
xu wenli one of the founders of the cdp was sentenced to  years in jail in december  along with two other prominent democracy campaigners
these efforts by the commission will continue
i will gladly provide more detailed information on that mr commissioner
the question will however have been recorded
i will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable member with the response he is seeking
i know that my colleagues elsewhere in the commission share this view which i share with the honourable member
question no  by h
the measures and actions announced in the white paper provide for a radical reform of the commission which will involve a considerable amount of time
can the commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement
clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement
all political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the commission
reform is therefore an essential precondition  a precondition for realising our vision of europe
i would like to thank the commissioner for his response
i would however like to add something
mr president the honourable member s approach to these and many other matters is i know extremely constructive
question no  by h
furthermore a launch belonging to the canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly thus hampering its fishing activity
a few days earlier canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a spanish freezer trawler which was also fishing in international waters
what information does the commission possess on these incidents
can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of nafo or the canadian government
has it taken any action in this regard or does it intend to do so
thank you mr president
the canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the nafo scheme
their inspection was carried out under its auspices
the santa mafalda arrived in aveiro on  may  and two commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel
mr commissioner i am satisfied with your reply but i would like to add something else
the european commission  like the fishing sector itself  has made significant efforts to iron out our differences
mr president i am grateful to the honourable lady
i understand from his second reply that he does not yet have the result of that inspection
that is what i wanted him to clarify
if that is the case i believe it would be prudent and logical for us to await the final result
i would like to receive it because this parliament will have to act accordingly
i would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of nafo regulations
mr president i will draw the honourable member s remarks to the attention of my colleague mr fischler and i know that they will be of interest to him
he summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions
question no  by h
does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations
will it reintroduce the institution of intervention but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned
second part
questions to mr solbes
i am happy to respond to mr korakas
the new regime would apply from the  marketing year which as the honourable member will know begins on  november 
as far as product promotion is concerned the community is already financing promotion campaigns through the international olive oil council
those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the european union and indeed in third countries
since the start of the  marketing year it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid
mr president we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this chamber
so how are we to deal with this situation
will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced
are you going to increase them
that is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets
thank you very much mr kinnock for your cooperation during this question time
we also congratulate you for using olive oil which is very good for the health
i also say this from a mediterranean standpoint
question no  by h
this should also bring benefits for savers and investors
budgetary consolidation itself which is of course the reduction of the public deficit gives each member state room to act in adverse situations
that is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility
thank you very much for your answer which up to a point contains many of the features i had expected
what kind of large budget
is it a large eu budget which is being considered
for example denmark has in fact on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the commission
in your reply  or comment  i note two implicit questions
firstly a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties
in the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact
i do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing but that is our obligation as the commission
earlier i referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the member states
i do not see any great correlation between the two questions but i do note that the euro is being taken seriously
what has happened with the euro
there are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation
it is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked
we believe that a strong economy means a strong euro
in these circumstances we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months
as an example i refer here to the decisions made by the french government on working hours
i will try to reply briefly although these are complex questions and i will therefore have to give this point some attention
the french president has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency
transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the united states but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in europe
it would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue
i am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year
question no  by h
questions to mr verheugen
therefore allow me to make a rather more general comment
the measures adopted in each member state must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them
it is also the responsibility of the member states to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions
i am grateful to mr solbes for the intention behind his reply which is to safeguard and show concern for worker s conditions
with regard to the basic problem i would make a different comment
our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment
basically because they are two completely different types of figure
i would like to say that in order to judge from afar it is often necessary to understand the reality
unless they all work in unison they will not achieve this objective
thank you for your comments
question no  by h
noone has ever counted them and i cannot therefore tell you how many there are
we usually talk of just over   legal acts in this context
mr president there is not very much to thank the commission for
it is really quite simple i have worked on it for a good many years
so there is nothing to thank the commission for
the legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the council by parliament by the commission and by all the community institutions
i do not know of a single member state of the european union whose laws are numbered consecutively
even the laws in your country  and i have taken the trouble of finding out  are not numbered consecutively
i have no intention of arranging for them to be counted
i am curious to know how it helps if i tell you that this figure is  or 
if you want you sit down and do it you can find the entire community acquis online on the celex website here in parliament
you tell your employees to count these legal acts because i shall not tell mine to do so
mr president commissioner the acquis is of course an important basis for accession
can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view
with which candidate countries has most progress been made
which chapters have been completed
chancellor schroder recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 
how do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time
what do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options
i can tell the honourable member that screening  ie legislative adjustment  was of course completed with all candidates some time ago
this amended acquis must of course be included in negotiations
but this happens on a regular basis
the screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates
your question is based on a misunderstanding
screening is not the same as negotiation screening is merely an adjustment process
that has been done
now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall
a few more will be completed during the portuguese presidency
but more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened
only the chapters entitled institutions and miscellaneous are still closed for obvious reasons
they come at the end
with the helsinki group of countries negotiations did not start until february of this year
between  and  chapters will be opened for these countries during the portuguese presidency
in all events the process is proceeding apace
it is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place
there have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months
the commission stated quite clearly in helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available
as things stand today i am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready
i have said on many occasions that i would like it to be ready by the end of this year at the nice summit
mr president commissioner my question does not concern the timetable instead i would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement
i hope this question was not an improper one at this time
madam what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion
there is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative
in any case it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less
there is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership
if there were i would know about it
but there is not
the candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust
question no  by h
what transitional arrangements have been agreed to date
questions to mr monti
mrs muller the question is based on an erroneous premise
the chapter entitled free movement of services has not been provisionally completed with any candidate country
nor do i expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future
mr president it is certainly correct to say mr verheugen that the chapter has not been completed but negotiations have started
you know i am from a border region and i know exactly what the situation is on the ground
you yourself know full well which industries are affected
is there any intention on the european side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services
i would gladly do so but i am not allowed to
however i can still answer the question because the commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised
transition periods must be very very limited in both scope and duration especially where the internal market is at stake
you must know that every transition period irrespective of whom it benefits suspends the internal market for that area
that cannot be the meaning of enlargement
the region which you come from and the region which i come from are just such regions
but we have not yet reached that point
the social chapter is the corollary and counterpart of free movement of services and labour mobility
the social chapter is in fact a part of our common regulations with which the candidate states must also comply
having given this general warning i give the floor to the commissioner
mr president to be honest the underlying question was how many legal acts does the european union have
now i am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country
however if you take the view that there is a connection then i am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so
all the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries
the charter of fundamental rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready
it is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised
we must also report in the progress reports  as you will have noticed  as to whether a country is complying with the copenhagen criteria
mrs thors is raising a point of order
i wish to point out that i was not earlier referring to mrs thors but to all meps but you have the floor
i would ask you not to enter into a debate with the commissioner
these include working conditions which i think are a corollary to the movement of services
what are the conditions under which services are provided
what are the conditions under which people are working
that is the corollary of free movement
mr president i did indeed hear the words charter of fundamental rights
of course the social charter forms part of the treaty and is therefore negotiated with all candidate countries
it forms part of the community acquis
we report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis ie to apply the social charter
commissioner we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods
these are two very fundamental points and i should like to know what the commission or your position is on this
my own personal opinion is irrelevant
as far as linking transition periods is concerned this happens automatically
basically their wishes concern transition periods
irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds
it is a german problem and it is an austrian problem
thank you very much mr commissioner for your replies
questions nos  and  will be replied to in writing
mr titley has the floor for a point of order
i think it is absolutely outrageous and i will be writing to the president to complain
mr titley i will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other meps
i am not getting at you
what has happened is that the  minutes devoted to mr verheugen have run out and it is now mr monti s turn to reply and he has been waiting some time
with regard to the rules of procedure i must tell you that there are two supplementary questions not one
please read the rules of procedure
there are two questions
i am not going to get into a debate
question no  by h
such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification
in practice notifications are frequently incomplete so that the commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision
the commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this timelimit
however this seems at present not feasible for different reasons
the commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures
this will considerably simplify state aid procedures
however in some member states there is still a serious problem created by delays in decisiontaking on state aids
as to time limits there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future
you mentioned the problem of resources
question no  by h
the euratom treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid
it would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case
as regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry the commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation
commissioner thank you for your response but i must admit i find it hard to grasp the logic of it
in other words the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 
alongside that nuclear energy amounts to  of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation
thank you mr turmes
i very clearly understand your concern but permit me some observations
i do not think therefore that you can accuse the commission of banning aid to renewable energies
aid to these forms of energy may moreover vary according to the member states
unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy
question no  by h
commissioner you have failed to answer my question
i want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid
you can provide state aids that are untouchable even by a commissioner as powerful as yourself
but let me ask you what exactly is the situation
you said that under the treaties there are derogations  and you quoted the euratom treaty
there is clearly a distortion between member states because of the state aids
where exactly in the treaty are the written permissions for these state aids
could you elaborate on that please
i shall try mrs ahern
first of all if you allow me i have here a note in french
on what part of the treaty then is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based
articles  and  make no reference to nuclear energy
so it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy
i believe i have given you all the information available to the commission on the subject
if however cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the commission
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
of those  amendments the council and commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part
the report therefore returned for a second reading
it also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data
for a scheme of this nature rigour and comparability in terms of the data collected by the governments are essential
if we bear in mind that community law  directives and regulations  is often not complied with it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with
they also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions but also their reduction
another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles
in this final agreement our main concerns have been addressed
the only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles
mr president i believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved
mrs gonzalez alvarez conciliation processes vary in difficulty i can assure you
i am glad that this one has gone smoothly
mr president commissioner allow me to start by congratulating mrs gonzalez alvarez
parliament has asserted itself against the council once again
the introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the kyoto protocol
some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels
despite all the pessimism introducing a paneuropean monitoring system for co emissions will not do any harm
but we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary
hence trust is good control is even better
and if they are not then we must take legislative measures
since the rio de janeiro conference and then kyoto the european union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change
it is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts
in terms of political action the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons
i regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system
in any event i congratulate mrs gonzalez alvarez once again on the results she has achieved
mr president commissioner i intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure
i think that is a huge success
i should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report
mr president i welcome the excellent result reached by the european parliament and the council on this dossier
i congratulate the colegislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement
therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the kyoto target
mr president unforgivably i have forgotten something
furthermore i would like to thank all the meps for their support
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
interoperability of the transeuropean rail systems
a on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the interoperability of the transeuropean conventional rail system
mr president i hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed
i think they are in the house and will arrive in time
unfortunately the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past
it is now  times higher than in 
in other words freight traffic especially transit freight traffic is growing massively
according to forecasts it will rise by more than  between  and 
that is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the european rail network
it totals   kilometres in length of which   km are accounted for by the ten network
at the moment we still have five different gauges
we need uniform electrification especially in relation to voltage and frequency
the third and i think the most important point is the safety of trains
we really do need external inspection and certification agencies
we cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it
what is the subject matter
ladies and gentlemen we must appreciate the full importance of this subject
there is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of european transport systems
directive  was adopted for this purpose
the conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future
these two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments
for the first time the railway industry rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability
they have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the international union of railways
finally during the transition period it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart
to this end new investments between now and the publication of the tsis shall have to comply with authorised technical references
to the many of you who contributed to this let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation
the directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned
interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport
better services greater comfort less travelling time increased safety and possibly also lower prices
the harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways
both together interoperability and liberalisation are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market
we are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out tsis
including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage
finally a few other proposed amendments have been tabled which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot
 mr president i would first like to congratulate mr savary on his drafting of such excellent reports
this is an important topic but also an extremely complicated one
mr savary has taken good account of the views of others
my group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition
the first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the european union
technical specifications for interoperability tsis and common standards are a sine qua non for the development of railway interoperability
the rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach
technical solutions can vary a great deal
this report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective
there is one further matter which would require fine tuning this was outlined in amendment no  by my group
they are not necessarily inferior but different
russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the union
for finland this is an exceptionally major issue
this proposal is very good but the solution remains halffinished as far as finland is concerned
it will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy
there is no certainty either that russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases
mr president environment commissioner i am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away
we are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter namely the interoperability of both highspeed and conventional rail systems
this gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal
in short the proposal has a knockon effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality
this does not bode well at all for the future
the second important point is of course the social dimension as i touched upon a moment ago
i regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum ie working conditions
mr president despite european integration the rail system is disintegrating
this is now a thing of the past
meanwhile railways are however in the process of being rediscovered
the times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century something that can be neglected and dismantled are fortunately over
the views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided
for a long time it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains
according to the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left these remedies are worse than the disease
in the case of the conventional railway system the routes brussels to amsterdam hamburg to copenhagen and dublin to belfast are good examples of this
the passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link
the position of the one million employees in the european rail system must be protected
they are people who offer useful services to each and every one of us
my group would like to see tradeunion rights participation working conditions and work pressure given a more prominent role
luckily the rapporteur is not yielding under the pressure to consider personnel as a cost factor alone
i am pleased that mr savary s proposals help strike a happy balance
mr president mr savary s reports raise a matter of crucial importance to european railways
given the alarming position rail finds itself in in most member states intervention is vital
the harmonisation of the physical networks for the conventional rail system is a step in the right direction and certainly deserves support
nobody can deny its importance
despite this i am of the opinion that a great deal of the work done by members is superfluous
most of their wishes have already been incorporated in some shape or form in the text of the directive
this should not be done again
furthermore we are dealing with a directive here which means that it makes little sense to include too detailed and intricate specific cases
this directive is extremely technical in nature and its main objective is to facilitate the use of all kinds of trains using all kinds of networks
this is why comments concerning personnel do not really seem to fit in here
only clear agreements on qualifications for personnel who will be deployed on crossborder routes are necessary
the curbing of the freedom of enterprise should not go further than strictly necessary
in short mr president i will certainly support the idea contained in the reports even if certain proposed elements are not appropriate in this context
we have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability
i also hope that the council will accept our proposed amendments
i hope that the council will do so and i call on it to act responsibly
we are opening the markets but we need interoperability in order to do so
it is grotesque every private company even small private companies think european nowadays
the comment about industry is correct
except that when it comes to american companies the situation is quite different
in europe uniting in a common european market is proving to be an arduous task
in this sense i should like to offer the rapporteur mr savary my full and unequivocal support and congratulate him on his excellent report
what we need is technical interoperability that has already been said
safety is also without doubt an issue
the huge advantage of the railway is that it is safe and environmentallyfriendly
for all these reasons none of them new ones the european union must make it possible to take up the challenge
in transport policies within the european union rail was overlooked
the declining figures for rail transport particularly for freight bear witness to the lack of investment at this level
in the race to develop infrastructures rail has been the great forgotten area
fortunately there are now crucial studies which make it possible to justify the urgent need and the relevance of investing in rail
these are to do with taking account of social dialogue which we deem essential
i would urge you to support the amendments to this effect
and new technical specifications for interoperability are at the forefront here
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the savary report follows the rationale of sustainable development
as we consider interoperability to be essential we support this report and offer our congratulations to mr savary for the pertinence of his observations
the roadrail balance must be adjusted by means of a carefully calculated interoperability
in the long term the increase in heavy goods transport will cause enormous problems such as congestion the construction of new routes and problems of safety and pollution
it is absolutely essential in this eventuality to have recourse to rail transport
interoperability is all the more necessary as rail transport is profitable over long distances
airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops
so let us adapt
we shall not be able to upgrade the competitiveness of rail unless we bring in stringent constraints
interoperability must be made compulsory particularly for the new networks that are being built even if the tsis have not been finalised
mr president commissioner a great deal has been said in today s discussion
in my view the most important points to be borne in mind are two figures which are really quite shocking
the second figure concerns the average hourly speed of railways in europe which is  kilometres per hour
and all this in the year 
evidently we need an immediate political response from the  member states of the european union
and of course we all endorse the report by mr savary whom i would once again like to commend on his work
however it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability
we should all realise that a common market without a unified transport network is simply willo the wisp
so if we want to examine the problem in its entirety we need to have and to provide the necessary responses
the first problem is that greece has no main crossborder rail links especially with other member states
mr president i too regret the absence of the commissioner here this evening
perhaps she is stuck at brussels airport
perhaps she should have taken the train
i begin by welcoming the commission s proposal to integrate europe s convention on a highspeed rail network
i thank the rapporteur for his patience his skill and above all his commitment to the cause of europe s railways
this problem i believe can only be solved satisfactorily at eulevel
what is the problem
in  the railways had a  share of the passenger market today just 
the very future of our railways is at stake together with the jobs of one million people employed in the industry
a key reason for this decline is that in contrast to aviation and road haulage a single market does not exist in this sector
for  years the railways have been organised along national lines
even the opportunity of electrification further divided europe s railways because there are now five different systems in operation
more recently the railways have adopted  different and incompatible electronic signalling systems
that all adds costs and it means railways cannot compete
differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment
this proposal being considered here tonight together with other proposals from the commission aims to create an internal market in rail services
that will make the railways more efficient reliable and more competitive
it would also boost the railway equipment industry in countries such as my own
the revitalisation of the railways is crucial to the future of europe s transport system our environment and our economy
that is why mr savary s report deserves our full support
mr president commissioner like aviation the present issue is reminiscent of air traffic control
instead we are now faced with the opposite
trains should not be confined to internal borders within a large european market
i think that is important
liberalisation and competition should be introduced within this large european market
that in my view is the best solution for customers and services
indeed a small country is vulnerable in that respect but a country which lies at major intersections is even more vulnerable to this
i think that we need to take sound steps and take them fast
a difficult issue was that of personnel
mr savary i welcome the compromise that we were able to reach in that respect
i am left with one question namely i wonder whether we are sufficiently ambitious as indeed we are only referring to transeuropean rail systems
this is especially important for those people who manufacture trains and train equipment
it means that a fixed link is being created between scandinavia and the continent
the bridge will make it considerably easier to convey people and goods from sweden and finland to the rest of europe
however we have a problem at present with different voltage systems
we have different gauges in sweden and finland
the only railway linking the two countries is that between haparanda and tornea
gauge switches are now being tested there to make it easier to cross the border
however there are also some extremely good examples of other systems
this works well because the countries concerned have cooperated with the employers and employees
within the eu we now have fifteen different and separate railway systems which are often incompatible with one another
this means that within the railways sector we have neither free movement nor a common market
coordination of the railway systems is especially important for those countries and regions which are not situated in the centre of europe
if compatibility is to be achieved the specifications of a range of technical components need to be brought into line with one another
road traffic in europe is increasing each year
it creates problems in the form of environmental damage noise overcrowding and accidents
in order to be able to cope with this trend methods of transport must become cleaner quieter safer and more efficient
railways are the means of transport which now best meets these requirements
rail transport must therefore become more attractive and competitive
in order to reach that point however the railways must be able to compete on the same conditions as other forms of transport
the savary report is therefore very important and one step along the road
it is now just a question of all the member states turning it into a reality
but still
it has taken more than  years for us to pluck up the courage here and give the railways another chance
and yet the facts do not look very promising
the rapporteur has included figures in his report which are all the more significant for being so thin on the ground
the prospects for highspeed trains are somewhat more encouraging although here too not everything in the garden is rosy
we shall leave them out of the scope of our directive and the friends of the railway will thank us
in this context a word to my austrian minister of transport
the southern railway in austria is an old stretch of line and is of regional importance
but more importantly it is the northsouth link in the east of the present union
if we do not invest in it the east of austria will run the risk of economic exclusion in the future
that is in nobody s interest
austria is excluded from the union at present more than enough as it is
let us end all forms of isolation and ensure that we have comprehensive interoperability in the union
applause from various quarters
therefore let us deal with this issue when other points are under discussion
mr president i believe that gilles savary has done magnificent work with these two reports
the routes of the railway structures on our continent were set a long time before schuman made his famous speech on the quai d orsay
in those days military factors were given priority over the transport of people and goods
paris and many other capitals and almost all intraeuropean borders act as barriers for through rail routes
for this reason the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades
we have managed to harmonise the european economy but the current rail network is not a useful instrument for the single market
therefore we resort to road transport despite the fact that it creates pollution and is dangerous
the inclusion of a social clause seems to me to be an excellent idea
these workers have already paid the price for our forgetfulness
their number has decreased by   in the last  years
it is possible to revitalise the railway as certain projects that have already been undertaken demonstrate
rail transport is not really a great help in this respect quite the reverse in fact
let us be honest the train has remained stuck in the nineteenth century
in percentage terms trains have certainly not retained their share in transport
we can only hope that they have retained it in real terms
trains are not durable and they are no longer clean especially the diesel locomotives
we have finally reached a point in europe where we are about to try to bring about a change in mentality
this is desperately needed and about time too for the sake of both the people and mobility within the european union
rail systems develop extremely slowly
as a result of this planes are still used in europe for shorthaul distances
this is already the case in the technical field in the form of the european association for railway interoperability
this should also be the case for railway legislation right across the board
after all railway companies have the necessary inhouse expertise and need to be involved in the entire process
take for example the night train from amsterdam to milan which will be introduced from  may
this route covers germany geneva and italy
each country has its own set of rules regarding speed safety and travelling comfort
only if these requirements are met can access be gained to the railway network
this beggars belief especially if the rules change and are adapted virtually by the day as has been the case
this makes the interoperability of the european rail systems almost impossible in practice
as a result a lot of things work well within our countries
however the deficiencies become apparent as soon as it is a question of crossing a border
as long as we have obstacles of this kind there will also be clear limitations of at least two different kinds
there is no doubt that the railways have been the big losers in recent decades and remain so
at the same time the market share for passenger transport has almost halved
it is just not an option to force goods or passengers back onto the railways
for this reason it is a step in the right direction when the commission seeks socalled operational compatibility within the railways sector
firstly a diversity of operators is required
secondly a distinction needs to be drawn between the national operator and whoever owns the track
otherwise the confusion between public authority and operator will continue to be an obstacle to the development of europe s railway networks
i would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect
it is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system
at the same time within my area people are talking about doing away even with parts of our present minute railway system
i find that totally atrocious
we have one of the main links between northern ireland and the republic of ireland between dublin and belfast
this is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently
then we have the link between belfast and larne which links us to the rest of the united kingdom
parts of this have had to be closed down because there is not enough money to keep it in repair and upgraded
this is the one commuting area from the northwest and it takes in part of the republic of ireland and the inner shore and peninsula
they need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to belfast to reach airports and everywhere else
so we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here
we have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link
i certainly want it within my region because that is important
it is hurtful when i go back to my region and am told the money is not there
it is hurtful when you go back and you are told that no we must improve the road system  we must not improve the rail system the rail system has a tremendous future
it is wrong it is totally unacceptable that it is allowed in any way to be run down
as is well known the commission has made the railways sector into one of its priority areas for taking action
this was especially made clear in the  white paper on the revitalisation of the community s railways
i am convinced that this can contribute to a renaissance for goods transport in the community
above and beyond these measures further efforts are required if the strategy is to be complete
by this i mean primarily measures which integrate the national networks and increase the quality of the public services
we all know how different the various countries technical standards and operating regulations are
this has also emerged clearly in the course of the debate
this makes international transport both more expensive and more complicated than domestic transport
these differences affect not only interoperability but also the internal market for railway equipment
the committee on regional policy transport and tourism has adopted an amendment to the report and in that way backed our own proposal
most of the amendments to the report are acceptable
a series of amendments entail actual added value something for which we wish to thank parliament
when it comes to the amendments i only wish therefore to deal with those which are unacceptable
first of all amendment  article 
the area of applicability is established in annex i and cannot be limited in the way proposed
those cases which are mentioned may be dealt with as special categories as special cases or at worst as exceptions
amendment  article 
the proposed change is incompatible with the idea that the technical qualifications for interoperability are to be introduced gradually
nor does it fall in with the need to prioritise those measures which provide the greatest benefits in terms of cost
amendment  article 
where this is concerned there are legal obstacles to acceptance
amendment  annex i together with amendment  on exempting passenger carriages from third countries
in order to achieve this minimum level of safety all rolling stock must fulfil certain minimum specifications
amendment  article  and amendment  annex vii
allow me to leave the other amendments because they all have our support
i would conclude my intervention concerning the interoperability of the conventional rail systems by thanking parliament for its efforts
we must hope that it will be possible to adopt the directive as early as at first reading
the directive will take on a key role when it comes to revitalising railway transport
i now move on to the second report which concerns the interoperability of highspeed trains
in this case too mr savary has prepared an interesting report containing a number of constructive observations and proposals
the commission will examine them in detail and as far as possible take account of them in planning its activities
this has to do with the fact that the railway network in question is still at an early stage of development
parliament s proposal for carrying out an assessment of how much progress really has been made on interoperability is therefore very interesting
at the request of a member state or of the commission this would provide a picture of the transeuropean rail system for conventional trains
increased interoperability is a key factor in our endeavours in this area
the council should accept our opinion and the commission should support us not the council commissioner
mr jarzembowski the name of the committee is the committee on regional policy transport and tourism
the joint debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  am
british nuclear fuels at sellafield
however it is clear from his own report that bnfl cannot be trusted
the response to previous recommendations by the nii was to ignore them
indeed i have documents showing this to be the case as far back as 
this shows arrogance even when they are called to account
surely it should have been the other way around
he gave me a serious answer
however what about euratom inspectors
can we trust them
do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control
i would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards because here we received conflicting answers in committee
local people often ask me what the eu is going to do about it
i can give them very short answers
i believe the scandal of abuse of safety at sellafield is a european question
the thorp reprocessing plant produces continually more waste
it is this plant that the inspectorate threatened with legal sanctions if the backlog is not cleared
reprocessing by its nature produces large quantities of liquid waste
for more than  years highlevel liquid waste has been stored in tanks at sellafield under constant cooling
even then they will still be highly radioactive for more than  years
the nii would like to see the minimisation of the amount of highlevel liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential hazard
i would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now
as this was clearly inaccurate according to the regulator s report this independent verification now lacks credibility
i have already talked about going native in regard both to euratom and the uk inspectorate
this is the polite euphemism for corruption and that is what we must control here
i would ask what does urgent mean in this context
we are closely following the developments and have made direct contact both with the uk authorities and with the company
the commission is highly concerned with this event which raises questions in relation to nuclear safety
the neglect of internationally agreed nuclear safety standards should be openly and firmly condemned
it is also clear that our member states do not wish to give up this responsibility
that is a quote from their report
the company has reacted to the requirement of the nii to produce a programme responding to the recommendations in the report
we are now awaiting the formal reaction of the inspector to this programme
therefore the verifications performed by euratom safeguards did not indicate that these declarations had been incorrect
therefore also for the transport of radioactive material the prime responsibility lies with the member states
as such the measurement deviations at sellafield do not have any consequences on the safe transport of pellets
however the commission welcomes any decision which would increase even further the safe transport of nuclear material
as such they would be unlikely to improve on current nuclear installations safety standards
it is therefore unlikely that harmonising minimum standards at an eulevel would have been able to prevent what happened at sellafield
there are however several activities at community level where harmonisation would be both beneficial and possible
these activities are based on common recognition of national requirements and the promotion of best practices
one area where there is scope for indepth harmonisation is in relation to new types of facilities
we have in fact set our sights and those of the accession states beyond such a level
we are working to encourage the applicant states to apply the good practices in use in the european union
one example of this is the development by the dgenvironment of guidelines for periodic safety reviews of the sovietdesigned light water nuclear reactors
another major step forward was taken only last week with the setting up of a european nuclear installation safety group
it will bring together nuclear power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both member states and applicant states
i am convinced that more could be done at community level to achieve this
i want to emphasise that safety was not compromised in the incident of record falsification
bnfl has responded positively to the  recommendations in one report and  recommendations in the other the falsification report
i do not propose to go through those in great detail
i have no time
let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here
regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance
members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course
both of these are forms of recycling
i welcome their launching of a project aimed at harmonising its members safety rules and practices
the regulators themselves are undertaking this job across member states who better to undertake that task
the result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all
the highest standards are required of any nuclear installation
i have considerable sympathy for the workers at bnfl let down by a sloppy management
their livelihoods were endangered
they will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture
i do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of mox
that is not under debate although those matters should be debated in the uk and elsewhere
bnfl is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly
there are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of european industry
we cannot really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector
the commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication
please come to our committee commissioner and we can discuss this further
if you want public acceptance  and many of you do  of the nuclear industry you have to ensure that
this whole sorry tale has added to the uk s reputation as sordid as it is often inaccurate as the dirty man of europe
i believe that all at sellafield must accept collective responsibility for the things that have gone wrong and must act to improve them
a number of improvements have been made the new chairman of bnfl has undertaken a fundamental review a number of people have been dismissed
there is undoubtedly progress
however there is a lot yet to be achieved and there is a long way for the uk to go and for bnfl to go to reestablish its reputation
i would ally myself with the concerns of mrs mcnally when she asked the commissioner to look again at these matters
the fact is that the commissioner telling us that the rules of individual member states are more specific is simply not good enough
i recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the republic of ireland and denmark
my group cannot support the green motion here tonight
we feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms
it raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at sellafield
but one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers
this is a saga in which nobody least of all sellafield comes out well
but it is an area where action at europeanunion level really can make a difference
mr president i wish to begin by thanking my colleague mrs ahern for raising this very important issue
wales like ireland has suffered from the radioactive contamination in the irish sea due essentially to sellafield
there has been a theory about a link between a high incidence of childhood leukaemia for example and proximity to the welsh coastline
it is this crisis of credibility in the management of british nuclear fuels which may actually bring about the end of reprocessing
bnfl was determined to press ahead with the sellafield mox plant to keep reprocessing going
it was cheaper for them to store waste and evidence published recently by the nuclearfree local authorities confirms this view
this is unacceptable
a strategic approach is needed
mr president an essential requirement in parliamentary work is rigour
this is the view of the british regulatory authority
it exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of mox fuel
these have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible
i hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue
i would suggest that one of the roles of parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place
i am glad that the commissioner has reinforced that view this evening
the fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured
but to say all this must not lead us to be complacent
it is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a parliament
mr president i have been a member of this parliament now for sixteen years
our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the british government
they have largely been treated  i regret to say  with indifference and indeed very often with contempt
there now exists in ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in sellafield
we are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant
i ask the commissioner to reconsider her point
we are joined in our concerns by them as well
i do not
i asked to speak because i want to try and help to get some truth into this debate
the trouble is when you talk about nuclear issues  especially sellafield  it is dominated by a distortion of the truth
when mrs ahern spoke she spoke of the nii giving a damning indictment of the plant
no it did not
she spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks
no it did not
it made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks as other speakers have said
she said the report came from a press statement in the independent
no it did not
the workers at bnfl raised the issue
they were the ones who discovered it
bnfl were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened
she spoke of contamination of the seas in ireland and denmark
when your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue
she spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety
that is an absolute insult to the people who work there and more so to their families who live near that site
those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe
they would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case
that is an absolute indictment of those people who work there
then she finished by talking about corruption
that really is the last throw of the dice
that is the best advice that i can give you and many members of this parliament also
let us be clear
there have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed
those lapses quite simply are not acceptable
in a society subject to the rule of law recent events cannot be used to close the plant
i know that there are many people who would like to see sellafield closed down
in particular i know this is a very strongly held view in parts of ireland
in a free society if that is how people feel they must be allowed to articulate their opinions
but that is no reason why the plant should be closed
there can be no question of any lawfully established enterprise in any part of the european union being closed by the public authorities without its breaking the law
this true in ireland denmark the united kingdom or any other member state
the owners  that is to say the united kingdom government  and the employees of sellafield have legitimate interests which quite simply cannot be swept under the carpet
this applies in this case just as much as to anybody else
i wish them well
but words are not enough
they must be matched by deeds  their deeds
from an irish perspective we are witnessing the beginning of the end of reprocessing at sellafield and we have allies
the powers of the commission in this area as the responsible community institution remain hopelessly inadequate embarrassingly inadequate
nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern
realists accept and understand that life is full of risks
what benefit accrues to ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of britain s nuclear installations
to minimise the risk to these population centres of course
witness the bse and dioxin problem
choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one s children is a very basic human right
in practice nuclear decisionmaking in the uk falls far short of democratic standards
often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy
i will conclude
serious doubts are being raised about the longterm viability of reprocessing
a director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt
mr president thank you very much for an interesting and valuable debate
it is in the interest of all of us to ensure that our citizens have confidence in our safety and security systems
i am ready to come any time to any committee in parliament to discuss those issues
i can say that personally i would very much prefer to have community rules
we need european rules
however we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly
i share the view that we ought to discuss it more thoroughly
it is not a wider forum but they can cooperate in this specific safety group
so even in highly advanced societies there are serious risks with nuclear and processing techniques
i should be pleased to come to parliament at any time to continue this discussion
however i do not want to give anyone false hopes about what can be achieved very quickly and with the help of member states
that is also why we have restricted competence
i have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to rule   of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
mr president i would like to make a comment in relation to yesterday s minutes
i do not appear amongst the signatories of the attendance register
i would be grateful if this error could be corrected
we will check the list mr valdivielso de cue and make the necessary correction
documents were taken away the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain
mr president this matter is one of the utmost importance
mr robin cook is in moscow today
he will discuss the matter with mr ivanov the russian foreign minister and the  ministers are thinking of a joint demarche
but we in the european parliament  what are we doing
nothing
we take note of your comment and your suggestion lord bethell and we will pass them on to the president
i believe this is worth sharing with the house
thank you for your statement mrs stenzel
the minutes were approved
broad outlines of economic policies
the commission however has avoided specifying the ratio of investment to gdp
ladies and gentlemen we achieved a significant degree of consensus in our work in the committee on economic and monetary affairs
of course there are certain differences in our assessment of the best way of achieving these targets
this percentage is a familiar figure
the commission set it repeatedly in its studies and it would not have hurt to have included it
just imagine ladies and gentlemen if that were to happen and we in the meantime had forgotten how to handle public investment
furthermore it is the european economy which is funding a good portion of us development
we therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market
obviously we endorse the general thrust of the katiforis report
in particular we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and above all salary agreements
on the other hand we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous
in the first place we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely
this is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking
there is not a word however on the current depreciation of the euro and its influence on the economy and economic policies
this debate has been deferred once again even though there is a great deal to be discussed
for years all the economic and financial advantages a strong euro was going to offer have been trotted out for our benefit
now the euro is weak are we to assume that the loss of these advantages has no implications worth mentioning
this is surely some mistake
finally the basic problem still remains
in this instance too then let us hope that the european parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future before it is too late
we have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its nonidentifiable character
formerly speculation on the exchange market involved the pound
now it is the euro
this is nothing particularly surprising for us members of the european parliament who are accustomed to seeing europe operating on a daily basis amid differences and antagonisms
it would almost be like the united nations issuing a currency
if this should happen and obviously we hope it does not then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible and this would not mean mr duisenberg
we shall judge the candidates in the french presidential elections according to the efforts they have made to get us out of this bind
mr president the report is selfcontradictory
however inflation should always of course be between zero and two per cent
it is now quite certain however that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times
we no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix
we have a central bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation
in this way the euro is allowed to depreciate and interest rates are increased with the result that there may be lower rates of growth and increased unemployment
it is worse than the sacred cows in india yet the report does not protest against this
in paragraph g on the other hand a new sacred cow is to be found that of high taxation
in that way people receiving cash benefits and unemployment benefit will be able to exchange these for proper wages
that is an alternative recipe for economic policy but one which is contrary to the treaty
mr president i enthusiastically support the further deepening of integration
the reason given for regional monopolies and concentration of power in regions with a small population base is rather lame
we must take advantage of the fact that we are in the european union to do things collectively
i wish to concentrate on research and development
we need scientists in order to have research and development
let us stop young people choosing to do other things
let us encourage women
let us ensure that competence in widelyused languages is increased
above all let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists
that is what makes them choose other careers
of course we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications
we need a strategy
jacques delors spelt it out in his white paper so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts
commissioner busquin s communication on the european research area is very good
let us be innovative in the european union
that would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do
it clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining even going beyond the requirements of the stability pact
the committee on economic and monetary affairs report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the lisbon decisions
it advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages it proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market
we must shake up the dogma of the stability pact
this is one of the shortcomings of the euro a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible excessively regulated markets
some say that political control of the economy at european level would be a way of resolving this crisis
beware
if political control has to be a means of control which transfers the interventionism of national economies to brussels this would be a bad move
mr president the present draft resolution by mr katiforis contains many valid points
we should however qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle
do we want even more
do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means
the lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society
it stimulates egocentricity social exclusion a blurring of moral standards and moral decay
the corruption of society eventually harms economic development
on a positive note attention is paid to the effects of an ageing population on the sustainability of government funds
only since  have both government expenditure and revenue fallen
the amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support
after all the kyoto agreement more than merits compliance
that is one of the reasons why the united states is doing better than europe
i refer to the remarks made earlier by mr lipietz for the committee on economic and monetary affairs
i am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation
i have a shared concern about the jobs of workers
that is a structural reform we must drive through
it is not just in that area
we see that the wealthiest states within the european union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid
that is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here
my concern where decentralisation is concerned is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy
unfortunately spring had already started this year
the text for the broad economic guidelines for  had already been drafted very much along established lines
that seems to me a highly interesting challenge for the commission s new secretary general david o sullivan
at the moment it is just tacked on at the end
among danes there is a great deal of scepticism about and opposition to the national currency being swallowed up by the euro
i only have time to mention a couple of points
the first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro
this is a crucial point
what is missing of course is a political superstructure for steering economic policy
it is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the danish people s consent
mr president the katiforis report is no more than a mundane vindication of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the member states
of its  paragraphs  go in for approval and then  indulge in selfcongratulation
as far as the working population of the countries of the european union is concerned there really is not much to be pleased about
this is one way of admitting that there is no place in this growth for employed workers or for retired workers
once again the council and the commission are acting as spokespersons for big business asking parliament to sanction it
we shall therefore be voting against this report
mr president we do not support the commission s guidelines
today together with the broad guidelines for economic policies other issues have been raised particularly in relation to the euro
this is not an issue we can go into today but i wanted to make those points
today we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies
the new broad guidelines differ from previous ones in that they partially incorporate lisbon
it has been said that they do not incorporate it fully
many of you have referred to the idea of full employment as a fundamental element
the problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns
we can put a figure on both our employment objectives as well as on what we take the expression full employment to mean as some of you have suggested
it all depends on what we consider the objectives to be
in our view this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market
it will therefore lead to more employment but also  as we have always argued  greater quality of employment
this is something we have regularly stressed
a major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment
that is why public and private investment are absolutely essential
since  investment has been increasing progressively
i would like to raise a point here which seems to me to be essential
some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy
i would like to make an additional comment on two points
with regard to the interinstitutional agreement this is clearly one of parliament s recurrent demands
i believe that this is a good direction to take and we must continue to cooperate in this regard in the future
as you all know economic policies are the responsibility of the member states and in this respect subsidiarity is guaranteed
in my opinion the greatest possible coordination is essential
i would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented
stability and convergence programmes
mr president commissioner i am very happy to reiterate your closing words in the debate on subsidiarity or coordination
this is the first time that this parliament has debated the  plans presented by the member states
we also ask in this regard  and i am returning to the debate on subsidiarity  for greater political commitment from the  national parliaments
we believe that this is a task which falls to everyone and not just to the european parliament
these include firstly labour reform which we discussed earlier
it is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate
in the longterm reforms we should also include the serious problem of population
in the programmes presented to us we note that particular attention is given to the ageing of the population
this is the way to tackle the problem at source and not only its effects
this is the only way we will prevent the old europe from becoming a decrepit europe
mr president the liberal group supports the rigorous and demanding report by mr pomes ruiz
this perception betrays a rather narrowminded budgetary policy
it is something in addition to the stability pact
but they are higher in europe because we have a social state
inflation has fallen over eight years from  to  thanks to constant and unstinting effort
i had hoped that we warranted more generous support for this tremendous effort which has required sacrifices on the part of the greek people
to say that greece will be unable to sustain the criteria i am sorry but that is prejudging the facts
the greek people are determined to apply the criteria and they will show their determination in due course
in fact in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between states there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators
in the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements
the commission must judge them but it is not our job to give instructions on this point
nor is it our job to give instructions on the stability programmes or structural reforms which you have mentioned
these structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies
i am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population
these are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the member states
we will also tackle the issue of our future obligations
all of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned
i believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth
having said this i am grateful for the effort you have made to assess the work we have done
mr karas referred to the greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria
in the case of greece exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments
therefore i believe that these concerns about greek inflation are sometimes excessive
secondly you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the pomes report
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
adoption of single currency by greece
mr president greece will be the twelfth country to sign up to the euro
at the beginning of the s greece was considered the sick man of europe economically speaking
the rate of inflation exceeded 
the european union officially described the budgetary deficit as excessive
the public sector was notoriously mismanaged
almost half of the public debt was due to ongoing transfers from the state to public undertakings
it must be noted that private operators have also discovered greece
in recent years it has become a significant net recipient of foreign capital
the stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion
international rating agencies have improved their rating for greek loans
the situation is far from perfect of course
there are still problems particularly regarding the restructuring of the public sector
the committee on economic and monetary affairs stresses the following points
greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of disinflation has a lasting effect
cooperation between the two sides of industry seems essential in order to maintain a situation of noninflationary growth
parliament has been consulted in the context of a political decision to be taken by the economic and financial affairs council after deliberation by the forthcoming european council
greece s entry into the euro zone does not entail any political risks
greece is entitled and indeed obliged to join emu
there are probably some economic risks but these are more significant for greece than for the countries in the euro zone
in joining the euro zone greece will be forced to maintain the culture of stability which has been established since  and this involves pursuing a responsible economic policy
mr president let me add a few more personal observations
i should like to congratulate the danish and swedish governments on having decided to consult their citizens regarding accession to the single currency
i hope that the results of these plebiscites will be favourable
in the same way i should like to see the united kingdom opt for the single currency in the very near future
there are some members of parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow or who will abstain
it must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency
of course the value of the euro has fallen in relation to the dollar and to a lesser extent in relation to the yen and the pound
such fluctuations are inevitable in a floating exchange rate system
even so the euro has not become a weak currency
in the last twenty years the deutschmark has experienced much more extreme variations in relation to the dollar
in  the dollar stood at  dm
in order to reach such a low level in relation to the dollar the rate of the euro would have to fall below  to the dollar
what structural reforms did germany undertake after  in order to ensure that the deutschmark returned to a rate of  or  dm to the dollar
the fact is the economic position of the european union is very sound and is much more favourable than it has been over the last decade
the only grey area is a rate of unemployment which although falling is still excessive
a return to full employment is certainly not calculated to please the financial markets most of all
generally speaking good news regarding employment makes the stock exchange nervous as it makes them afraid of a rise in inflation
financial markets operate according to their own particular logic
they look for immediate returns and currently this is a safer bet in the united states particularly because of its higher interest rates
this trend looks set to continue as the federal reserve has just hiked up its interest rates
for those other out countries including my own i very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon
historically that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of usd  in december  and a low of just usd  in february 
in other words the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further  or rise by 
certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the italian lira but the same point applies even to the mighty german mark on its own
if the euro is a weak currency than the mark was positively anaemic
within three years and a dollar crash the mark was back to dem  during december 
 el mr president the report under discussion contains accurate information and an objective assessment
in all events this moment is an historic moment for greece and may i say for europe too
for greece and the other members of emu the problem of sustainability is crucial
greece has a tax reform problem
this structural change is pending while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation
these are the areas which need to be strengthened immediately if sustainability is to have a future
the union for a europe of nations group almost agrees with their conclusions but as a result of a very different logical argument
our initial impulse obviously would be to refrain from participating in a debate which a good number of us think is nothing to do with us
but on the other hand we think that extending the euro zone may in the end provide the stimulus for beneficial reforms
the truth is that greece now meets the convergence criteria with the exception of the public debt criterion
however they are due mainly to the efforts of the greek people as a whole
i hope that soon the verdict of the swedish people will take the completion of the euro zone one step further
the greek government has major financial interests in an extensive number of government enterprises which are mostly loss making
why did the commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment
on  january last the greek drachma was revalued by  mainly to push down inflationary trends
at the moment the shortterm interest rate in greece is about  basic points above the european central bank s level
participation from  january  means that the shortterm interest rate must come down by the end of this year at the latest
as a result the credit facility will expand considerably and greece will be unable to meet the inflation criterion
why does the commission turn a blind eye to this
this success is particularly significant because it was built on the basis of an economy which was not rich and not particularly strong
we do not need you to remind us that the greek economy is weak
we know it is
this effort is dictated by our wish to have a better standard of living to run a modern economy and to prosper with the rest of europe
no one should rejoice prematurely at the present vicissitudes of the single currency
that is the meaning of greece s accession that is the meaning of its acceptance
europe has become stronger today not weaker as the result of greece s accession
so too does mr goebbels report even if the part about sweden is limited
the swedish economy is doing well  very well
mr goebbels also points this out
this is a timely reminder of something which is selfevidently the case
if one is going to join the eu one should not do so by halves
this could have been brought out more clearly in the report
the euro has provided greater stability
this has benefited companies especially small companies
price competition has increased and there has been greater transparency
the euro is not weak instead it is the dollar which is extremely strong
allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further
at present the economy is on the way up in europe but the clouds are gathering  in the united states and in europe
the euro provides europe with economic stability and competitiveness
there are very strong economic and moral reasons why sweden should join emu
sweden should also have an obligation to help increase europe s economic competitiveness
i should therefore have liked to have seen my home country sweden being able to join with greece today
as far as emu in general is concerned we are in favour of real economic and monetary union
unfortunately this union is only monetary not economic
it is mu not emu
this is the opinion expressed by the nobel prizewinning economists friedman tobin and modigliani
the creation of emu was not preceded by an agreement on the economic policy which the member states had to follow
but the road is long and full of adventures as the poet says
however the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone
we agree
there is no danger to the economies of the other  member states
of course i have trouble understanding how anyone can distinguish so easily between political and economic risks but we shall let that pass
as far as greece is concerned our reservations concern the economic risks mentioned in the report
the sole aim of the economic policy pursued by greece over recent years has been to satisfy the convergence criteria
efforts have focused on improving indicators not real economic quantities
the competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise
wage differentials have been sacrificed to indicators and are increasing and as a result the figures are doing well while the people are suffering however
it is therefore the greek government s choice of means which we object to
the means chosen were neither economically suitable nor socially just
the rich got richer and the poor got poorer
in joining emu we are jumping in at the deep end and hoping for the best
some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress
the stability and growth pact calls for member states to reach in the medium term a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus
it must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios
i welcome greece into the euro zone
it is also clear that sweden and denmark will accede to the single european currency regime over the next couple of years
it will be adjourned for a formal sitting and will resume immediately after the formal sitting
i therefore urge the members not to leave the chamber at the end of the formal sitting
agenda
are there any objections
that is why the bureau proposed this solution
madam president i respect what the presidency has said but i have different information that this morning all the versions are available
i accept the president s words but i must point out that there is some inconsistency here
mr baron crespo i quite understand your objection
perhaps mrs buitenweg can give us her opinion as rapporteur
we have an agreement with all political groups in this parliament that we would accelerate proceedings for this directive
the council will be convening before our next plenary sitting
i therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here
if we fail to meet that commitment what does that say to the racists
and my second point we talk about the dignity of parliament
what about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment victimisation and discrimination
ladies and gentlemen i should like to make things quite clear
i think it would not be right to vote on it immediately
madam president i do not see why the conference of presidents should make the decision
mr cohnbendit i think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough
i did not suggest that the decision was referred to the conference of presidents which does not have the authority to decide
it goes without saying that only the plenary assembly has the right to make this decision
i should now like to put an end to any further speeches on the subject as i am afraid that discussing the matter ad infinitum is not going to lead to a clear decision
i shall just give the floor to mrs ludford whose group has not yet had an opportunity to comment
it is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions
after all if it were technically impossible the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow
vote
mrs muscardini i suppose you wanted to speak on the next item but quite frankly i would urge you not to take the floor
i cannot deprive you of your freedom of speech however but i do appeal to your sense of responsibility
i will not go back to the previous debate although i had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter

explanations of vote gonzalez alvarez report a
why am i in favour of this measure
it is above all old cars the cars which have been in use for a number of years which cause atmospheric pollution
i therefore support the use and preservation of pensioner cars as well
 fr the gonzalez alvarez report deals with reducing co emissions a necessary goal particularly with the fight against global warming at stake
furthermore the increase in the number of vehicles plays a major part in the increase in co emissions
it is better than nothing but not much
despite its limitations we nonetheless voted in favour of the gonzalez alvarez report
smet report a
the doctors will need to have learnt their trade well free from considerations of working time
i refer in particular to categories of the transport sector
 el it is a fact that man s strength and capabilities are limited
extending the directive is essential but it is not enough
we struggle greatly with the long transitional periods for the junior doctors sector
under certain conditions this period can be extended by another two or three years
needless to say we feel for the many member states which struggle with inadequate staffing levels in their health sector
this favourable vote is of capital importance as it concerns the health and safety of some  million workers in europe
the nineyear period is to be subdivided as follows a fouryear transposition period and a fiveyear transition period
for some states however this sort of nineyear period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjustments
these states may therefore be permitted an additional period of two years
the maximum number of weekly working hours may not then exceed 
these restrictions are no longer acceptable today
that then is one urgent question to be raised for the forthcoming revision of the treaty
ambiguities and inadequacies are however just as evident in the proposal before us
mrs smet s proposal extends the general rule of  hours to some of these sectors
in such circumstances how can we expect the european union s social policy to be taken seriously
until  there will be no change there will be no restrictions on working hours
between  and  the maximum working week will be  hours
between  and  it will be  hours
between  and  it will be  hours
in adopting this text we are sending out a worrying message
social europe will not make progress nor will it convince our countries citizens with proposals such as this
rothberendt report a
so let us combine practical action with a desire for improvement
 fr i should like to express my satisfaction with the content of this report
it incorporates all community regulations in force in the field of tses
 fr the problem under discussion this morning was first identified a long time ago
why has it been necessary to wait so long to effect the necessary changes in the regulations
why is there this time lag between scientific discoveries and community proposals
it is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread
they will be a significant component of bse monitoring at community level
let us not however treat them like a universal panacea
these tests can only detect the affected prion protein above a certain level
they are therefore no substitute for in particular the withdrawal of specific highrisk materials
savary report a
this is not the purpose of today s report but in view of debates we will have in future i wished to state this publicly
madam president i voted for the measure contained within the savary report on the transeuropean conventional rail system
how could i do otherwise
this is a clearly a matter in which the european union must intervene on account of the subsidiarity principle
longdistance transport can only be regulated at european level
nevertheless there was room for improvement in this measure but i hope that this will be achieved over the next few years
savary report a
 i voted against the report on the transeuropean highspeed system a
the highspeed sector and the conventional rail system respond to quite different philosophies
the former report received unanimous support in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism
only half of the members of the very same committee voted for the latter
this fact is in itself expressive enough
this report drawn up pursuant to directive ce gives an initial assessment of the progress made
the majority of member states have not to date transposed the provisions of this directive into their national legislation
we are a long way from debating the priority to be given to rail
it would however be unfair to say that no progress has been made
even so these achievements are still inadequate in terms of the issues at stake
the figures speak for themselves in  the railways had a  share of the goods transport market today they have only 
the trend is the same for passengers where the market share has dropped from  in  to 
where freight is concerned the railways could quite easily disappear altogether from large areas of the goods transport market
there is no doubt that the closure of large parts of the european network would lead to significant job losses
it is therefore essential to give a fresh boost to interoperability
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
adoption of single currency by greece continuation
mr president allow me first of all to congratulate greece on its extraordinary economic progress
the commission has now concluded that greece fulfils all the convergence criteria
i am convinced that parliament will take the same view
against that background i have no reservations about recommending that greece join the euro zone as from 
sweden too fulfils the basic economic requirements
however sweden still does not fulfil all of the more formal requirements
i am very well aware of the implications of the treaty
we are therefore also grateful for the phrases in mr goebbels report in which he welcomes this democratic process
i look forward to that day
mr president i would like to make a brief comment concerning sweden
sweden joined the european union without an optout certainly not in respect of monetary union
there is talk of a referendum coming up
i would like to know when exactly that will be as i am sure there is not a date for this yet
the swedish government sets an extremely bad example for the candidate countries which are at this moment waiting to join
mr president i would now like to move on to greece
i have a problem with that country
the greeks have produced a fantastic achievement
i only wonder how long the effects of that achievement will last
greece probably does not meet the criteria any more or less than other countries did
the euro zone should be able to carry a relatively small economy such as the greek one quite easily
this is why parliament on behalf of the citizen has to send out a signal to the union s large member states
but the central bank for example is not concerned with the euro s external value
the true culprits are the governments of germany france belgium and especially italy
they do not introduce the required structural reform within their own markets
why is italy not called to task when it makes a shambles of its good intentions
the large member states and belgium are trifling with the interests of all european citizens
it is said time and again that the european citizens are not adversely affected as long as they stay in europe
but surely mr president we should not make that decision for them
in the netherlands many farmers are emigrating to north america
a weak euro lets them down badly
businesses within the european union have become  cheaper for the united states to buy
i think it is time for some changes
i will be abstaining from the votes today
mr president i am wholly and unequivocally in favour of greece s adoption of the single european currency the euro
the european parliament must express a political opinion it must speak from the heart and not on the basis of figures it must listen to its soul instead of numbers
and i refer in particular to the greek pensioners
you may wonder why as representative of the italian pensioners party i am interested in greek pensioners
mr president the euro was born two years ago
now two years have gone by  without any response or progress on sweden s part
we are unfortunately the country without an emu strategy
for my part i can only congratulate greece as the twelfth country to adopt the euro
that is indisputable
it is amazing however that more is not being done by europe to reverse this trend
for me the reason for this is clear
there is a lack of confidence in the european governments
it is time to implement the structural changes which are often talked about but which are still not being carried out
with lower taxes and a more flexible labour market europe can enter the new economy
there needs to be more rationalisation of the budget more exposure to competition more deregulation and a more rapid phasingout of monopolies
if the governments of europe give priority to this work we shall immediately find confidence in the euro increasing
but many of the eu s social democraticled governments are visibly unable to take action
there is a lack of leadership
mr president i would like to thank mr goebbels for his report and also the various participants in this debate
today we are studying the report on convergence which deals with the swedish and greek problems
with regard to sweden the situation has hardly changed since 
with regard to greece the situation is radically different
greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in  but now it does
by that i mean that it fulfils them in the strictest sense using exactly the same criteria as in 
there have basically been two issues of concern debt and inflation
are they sustainable
is this inflation situation sustainable or durable as you call it
in the case of greece debt stands at more than  of gdp practically the same as in belgium or italy
in comparative terms the greek situation is similar to the italian or belgian situation at the time of their accession to the single currency
the second point of concern is inflation
greece has been complying with the inflation criteria for some months and the situation is improving considerably
this morning i had the opportunity to discuss the greek figures which were issued a few days ago by the greek national statistical service
the eurostat figures were also published this morning
in comparative terms therefore greece s current situation is quite sound
therefore in terms of figures i believe that we should not worry about the greek situation
however the commission also shares the concern which certain meps have highlighted
we have therefore insisted on two points in discussing both the broad guidelines for economic policies and the convergence report
i am convinced that all of that will happen and the greek government has committed itself to ensuring that it does
i therefore believe that the entry of greece into the euro will help rather than hinder it
the euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join
i hope that the path being taken by greece will be followed by other member states in the next few years
this is the end of a process
when will the commission enforce the treaty
the commission always respects the treaty
secondly we should not forget either that participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the ems is a voluntary decision
thank you very much commissioner solbes mira
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
transparency of financial relations between member states and public undertakings
mr president article  of the treaty captures the very essence of the resolution
it is up to the commission to monitor the observation of this article and to provide fitting directives or decisions to the member states
let it be clear then that the much desired level playing field no longer exists
the present situation promotes money wasting distorts international trade and as such forms a threat to the internal market
these are the considerations with regard to the proposal
in short what is the origin of investments in the commercial field
initially the commission proposal met with a great deal of resistance from emac and the commission
in actual fact there was only a handful of ppede members and the liberal group who were in favour of the planned transparency
this caused me concern
we as meps are elected to exercise democratic control over the executive in this case the commission
the commission is in turn responsible for observing article 
i wonder how we must come across in a situation like this
in the report on the adoption of the single currency by greece i blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done
those against this directive are thus giving the governments a helping hand
this directive may seem tedious but is in reality the acid test
in your proposal commissioner you quite rightly exclude a number of sectors and we can only be pleased at this
at the present time there is no definition of services of general economic interest at european union level
my third observation commissioner is on public broadcasting services
once again i cannot ignore what we incorporated into our treaty when we amended it in amsterdam
this sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions
i just wanted to complain about the quality of sound reproduction
there is a bad echo in the chamber as a result of which we can hardly hear those speaking in their original languages
can something be done about this
we will try to resolve the problem you have raised in your speech mrs maes
we want to thank mrs randzioplath for cooperating so well
state aid distorts competition and is unfair to both consumers and companies
in principle the treaty prohibits all types of state aid including crosssubsidies
the member states should not however themselves decide what kinds of aid they will be granting these undertakings
the rules must be applied in the same way to all parties
all aid which is not used to finance services in the public interest is prohibited and is to be opposed
an example is internet connection
in that case competition is distorted to the disadvantage both of consumers and of private companies
these are very reasonable demands
both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings
this is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market
first of all i should like to thank commissioner monti for having had the courtesy to consult the european parliament
my second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive
having said that the problem is by no means easy to solve as the previous speaker made clear
i await the commission s response on the matter
i think this amendment is an improvement on the current text paragraph  is a masterpiece of diplomatic language but is relatively incomprehensible
i should therefore like to see the commission expressing its support for amendment no  as proposed in plenary
thank you very much mr president
there are clearly opposing views in this house on this subject matter
we must ensure that with the advance of new technology the public service broadcast ethos is not undermined
the president cut the speaker off
mr president i also wish to add my congratulations to mrs randzioplath for the work on this report which has been difficult at times
this directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition
however i believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach
admittedly an exception is made but then this exception accommodates further exceptions
for example it is very difficult for public broadcasting to survive in an increasingly commercialised environment
i am against the commercialisation of culture
in my opinion culture is above these market laws
the commission has thus overstepped the mark
i can already tell you that i will be here once again when you produce a directive on film
thank you very much commissioner monti
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
poor countries debt
mr president i would like to thank mr tajani mr van velzen and mr poettering for their valuable substantial contributions to this debate
parliament has attempted to deal with the issue on more than one occasion but it has never appeared to find satisfactory solutions
in addition we would be stemming migration flows which quite apart from being a problem for the migrants countries of origin are above all a problem for the host countries
this would i feel be a different way of interpreting the meaning of the millennium this time in the name of solidarity between communities
we are all aware of the situation
the whole thing verges on the ridiculous
peace between nations can only be achieved if there is balance
political and economic balance are on the other hand devastating to a world which is increasingly unipolar
mr president hearing the other speakers i note that we all agree on the facts
the harsh and tragic figures are there for all to see
the  poorest countries spend twice what they receive in aid in order to pay off their debt
an average of  of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments
what action are we taking to prevent this
the indebted countries were expecting a strong message from the conference between the european union and africa held in cairo recently
they were given plenty of fine words but no practical action
the commission s contribution to debt relief can be seen in the hipc initiative
it represents a coordinated effort by all donors including in particular multilateral creditors
it was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly
as mentioned before the community as a creditor is only a small player in this discussion
fortunately we are mainly a provider of direct grant assistance and not loans
the community has since decided to considerably enhance support for the hipc ii initiative
in june it will present the relevant financing proposals
according to the information available needs for the first tranche this year will be in the order of the magnitude of eur  million
the first ec tranche will be paid in july
these are still needed in order to fully finance the initiative announced at the g summit in cologne
the expectation created a year ago was that the g countries would come up with additional resources
this draft budget needs to be passed in congress and this is definitely facing some difficulties
in fact it seems very doubtful that the us will deliver its share as planned
this view has also been clearly expressed by the european court of auditors when commenting on these issues
our hands are somewhat tied in this discussion on how we can accomplish these things in practice
the commission has expressed its strong support for this radically new approach initiated by the world bank and the imf
the community is maintaining and stepping up its commitment to support macroeconomic reforms social sectors regional integration and sound economic management
that cannot be allowed to continue but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen
this is why the recent euafrica summit held in cairo was so important
a longterm strategy is essential and cancelling the debt is the starting point for such a strategy
resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development
in order to succeed we need to harmonise national policies and supplement them with greater opening up of the markets
the recent euacp agreements follow this rationale and provide assistance for the  least developed countries over a period of time which should end in 
mr president there is no point flogging a dead horse
this is why the disastrous vicious circle of loans debts and new loans must be broken
the immense repayment costs prevent any form of development
debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency
however a very broad strategy will not get us much further
the debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country
it is essential in this respect to tackle not just the social problems but also to lay a firm foundation for sustainable economic development
if this fails to materialise then foreign investments will not be forthcoming either
a prerequisite for relieving debts is sound financial housekeeping within the governments concerned
we should not be naive about this
we can no longer write out blank cheques
in the past billions never reached the intended causes
the imf and the world bank started an initiative back in  to relieve the debts of the poorest countries
last summer the conditions were amended with good reason
aid was made conditional upon tangible results
it would be wonderful if the european union and the member states were to take a generous stance if the conditions were met
let us do everything possible to help the poorest countries fight poverty
this can work if the victim is involved in his own rescue
there are at least two questions which i think must be answered
that is naturally not enough
the council responded by saying that it was not in favour of that kind of control
the president cut the speaker off
the same is true of the states which have maintained links with western powers by means of economic agreements of this type
mr president this year is  ad a jubilee year
in the holy year each fiftieth year debts were cancelled slaves released and the land was left fallow in israel
such a year created the opportunity to start the future with a clean slate
in analogy with this biblical reference the year  should become a holy year for the world s poorest of the poor
we therefore welcome national and international initiatives to reduce debts with open arms
these rich countries boast about the fact that they no longer make a fuss about the gigantic amounts which these poor countries owe them
in the bestcase scenarios  debt relief only yields an actual  reduction in the debt
as such it is not a matter of making available additional financial resources but more a matter of shifting funds
in this respect it is desirable to deploy local governments and ngos
these minor observations however do not detract from the fact that concessions made must be met and new initiatives have to be launched
a careful and generous stance is a welcome bonus in this respect
the commission member states and international donors must make every effort to turn the year of our lord  into a holy year in the true sense of the word
the question we are left with today is what will come of this
we have heard a few examples from the hipci and hipcii programmes and i understand that  billion is tied up in this second programme
the total debt burden of all developing countries comes to  billion
this means that in comparison this  billion is really peanuts
the harsh reality is that the billions which are paid to repay debts far exceed the development aid
that is a disastrous situation because we often ask ourselves why our development aid does not work
well here is one of the most important reasons
one question which remains is should you cancel debts unconditionally
i do not share the view of mr miranda or other meps who think one should
in my opinion conditions should very much be part of the deal
the countries involved should be the poorest ones to start with
i do not agree with mr da costa who said a moment ago that this might be somewhat neocolonial
mr president we should really call for something to be done about this
we should simply spend  of the total development budget on cancelling these debts
if we do nothing the countries will remain trapped in a downward spiral
mr president i have listened with interest to both the council and the commission
i do not agree with the council when it says that this may mean a new form of colonisation
i do not believe that to be the case
this is therefore an example of the need for coherence and coordination between community policies
mr president it is commendable that the international community is apparently serious about reducing debt
unfortunately this inspired policy comes too late far too late
let us learn from past experience
i am in favour of debt reduction but not on a level repayment or unconditional basis
it should feature as part of an integrated and multilateral strategy
it must be accompanied by proper management requirements
mr da costa that is not neocolonialism in my book
as the commissioner rightly says the burden deserves to be shared
that is an appalling fact for us to take on board
so far the united kingdom is the only country that has offered  debt cancellation
japan incidentally ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy japanese exports
this is essentially an issue on which there is a degree of agreement particularly within the european union
this is the crucial issue debt is a symptom but underdevelopment is the disease
it is our opinion that these issues are fundamentally linked to development
mr president i wish to begin by commenting on the necessity of conditionality
i agree with a number of the contributions here
in a way one could say that we are witnessing a move from the washington consensus to the copenhagen consensus
all this shows that the fight against poverty is at the centre of this effort
i turn to the matter of whether too few countries are part of the initiative
it would be wrong to think that we could simply broaden its scope and welcome all developing countries to it
there would be a number of adverse effects if we did so
this is also the case for the billion of edf money we are reallocating
so we are doing something very concrete by improving the poverty focus of our general activity in this reallocation
that part of it is highly welcome
otherwise the european union is the only one able to do something of real value
finally i welcome very much the way this debate has gone
parliament s interest is an important asset for the european union
thank you very much commissioner
i have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
situation in zimbabwe
the next item is the statements by the commission and the council on the situation in zimbabwe
all of the european union s candidate countries as well as the countries of the european economic area have given their backing to these statements
various meetings have also been held with the government of zimbabwe at the council s initiative
the troika of european union heads of mission in harare will personally convey this message to the zimbabwean authorities
next monday the general affairs council will consider the commission representatives report on their visit
the commission is concerned about the evolving situation in zimbabwe
zimbabwe for decades a stable country is now going through an increasingly severe economic and political crisis
parliamentary elections have now been announced by the government for  and  june
this is a good sign
recent weeks have witnessed a series of international initiatives to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections
the commission continues to urge the government of zimbabwe to hold elections free of intimidation
i had a very direct conversation with president mugabe at the euafrica summit
i followed this up with a letter to him this week
eu observers are not being sent to legitimise an electoral process so far marked by intimidation and violence
acknowledging the long experience of the european parliament in election observation we invite representatives to participate
these poverty alleviation programmes facilitate the pursuance of dialogue with civil society and provide an appropriate political signal
the international community while condemning certain governmental actions still supports the people of zimbabwe
suspension of these privileges would be economically crippling for zimbabwe and would aggravate the crisis
but so far i believe we have followed the right course
but on the down side he is increasing all the army and civil servants pay as a straight bribe
some of these demands have now hopefully been implemented but not before another white farmer had been murdered
what a waste in a country dependent on agricultural exports
it was therefore gratifying to hear nelson mandela criticising the policies of the zimbabwe president who is destroying his country
i am sorry that president mbeki his successor who is probably the most powerful leader in africa has not in public condemned the violence in zimbabwe
the use of article  should be considered
the world bank has now cut funding because of debt arrears and zimbabwe as a country is in liquidation
i also welcome the fact that we will be supporting civil society s objectives in these next few weeks
all reporting of opposition parties is negative with the mdc a particular target
the fact is that the independent press does not have the print capacity to deal with demand
people in zimbabwe are afraid
the deaths and injuries in the rural areas and increasingly in the towns are deeply worrying
zanupf has the government resources and the mdc supporters are too afraid to donate money
it is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on zanupf grounds
this is wrong because the role of these government civil servants in the last referendum was very dubious indeed
the people understand that and are aware of it
there is evidence also of this fifth brigade being involved in preelection crackdowns
mr president why have so many african freedom fighters who we admired so much ended up as powercrazed potentates
why have so few former colonies turned into constitutional states
where anarchy and lawlessness rule the law of the most brutal party applies
in zimbabwe this takes the form of mr mugabe
where this country used to be a model for the third world of how things should be done it has now degenerated into its own opposite
land reform is necessary of course
the possession of land in zimbabwe still reflects the old colonial relations and this will needless to say cause tension
according to the zimbabwean election monitors the incessant violence renders free and fair elections impossible
as long as this is the case the election date has to be postponed
a situation whereby mr mugabe legitimises his position through violence and intimidation must be avoided at all costs
if the elections are not conducted fairly european aid will need to be postponed
but the cooperation according to lome cannot continue if mugabe also renders elections impossible
the zimbabwean population deserves a far better government than it has at the moment
it is high time that the european union spoke very clear language
the black people of zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism
the legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in zimbabwe today
we condemn the violence but we also see that black zimbabweans have a compelling case
this makes president mugabe s refusal to proceed with the lawful land redistribution programme even more deplorable
it is a fearsomely difficult problem when mugabe will not negotiate
it is a truly remarkable achievement and a case study of mismanagement in recent history
i was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the greens
yet out of despair comes resolution determination and hope
it has a functioning civic institution and culture
elections are due and voter rolls are being prepared but those voter rolls must be verified before the election
the opposition parties want more transparency
twenty people have been killed and more than   farms illegally occupied
mr mugabe has lost control of the country presiding over lawlessness and corruption
on  june elections are going to be held
yesterday the commonwealth secretarygeneral said that it is still possible to have free elections
the future of the country lies with the young people of zimbabwe
they demand the elections
they must be given a chance
it is their future
one thing we must do is to change the culture that is prevalent in africa today that the winner takes all
we must stop this winnertakesall culture that every african country has and i mean every country
we must be seen to have free and fair elections and to demonstrate that they have been fair and free
i think that this is vital because those who are not kindly disposed towards the mugabe regime those in opposition will clearly need protection
i would therefore like to back up the commission in this opinion
observers need to be sent to zimbabwe at the earliest opportunity today if possible rather than tomorrow
another worrying development is the reaction of the neighbouring countries
from europe we have fought for years to establish racial equality equal opportunities democracy etc in southern africa
at the moment there is a deadly silence in the neighbouring countries which in my opinion is a very ominous development
we must avoid this at all costs
threats can never create confidence and social harmony
lawlessness can never create security and human solidarity
the churches of zimbabwe the lutheran world federation and the world council of churches appeal to your conscience
since independence in  sweden has provided a total of sek  billion in aid corresponding to usd  million
enthusiastic young people from our two countries met
we want to believe in you again even though a lot of bad things have happened
put away hatred
do it for the sake of your own reputation both now and in the future
do it for the sake of zimbabwe s citizens and do it for the sake of africa
first in answer to mrs kinnock  we are indeed in close contact with civil society
civil society represents a hope of achieving a civilised society
but there is some way to go right now
we are also in direct contact with the opposition
we make a point of getting in contact with all players in a very visible and clear way
we are urging the mugabe government to accept that pluralism must be there to stay and this is also the point of sending in the observers
i hope we can solve the problems of funding of the observer mission
i have to tell parliament that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of our system
we cannot just push a button somewhere in our system and the funds appear
it is highly complicated to find the money for this in time
this is the kind of system we have
yesterday s discussion about the external relations reform is even today relevant
at least we have excellent coordination on the ground in zimbabwe with the member states which is very helpful
let me finally explain to you what we are doing on the ground even in this situation
thank you very much commissioner
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule  of the rules of procedure
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow thursday at  noon
question time council
the next item is question time b we will examine questions to the council
i would like to remind you that we are  minutes behind schedule
that is very important work it is already scheduled and we must work as quickly as possible so that the maximum number of questions can be answered
the rest will be replied to in writing
we will begin question time
question no  by h
subject undesirable persons in turkey the turkish newspaper sabah has published a list of  persons considered undesirable in turkey
this issue was specifically raised by the presidency at the association council meeting between the european union and turkey on  april 
 el i should like to thank the presidentinoffice both because the question was raised and for his reply
i hope that this is in fact the case
should the council and the presidency not have made a move to help leila zana
mr president on a point of order
you will notice that the date on this question is  march  which was two weeks before the last partsession
i should like you to investigate why this should be
mr purvis i believe that we should not enter into any judgement of intentions
i would like to point out  although you already know  that the president together with her office decides on the order of questions
i do not know whether mr alavanos has so much influence with the presidency of parliament
what i can tell you is that it is not the greek communist party but synaspismos
that i do know about
however we shall continue with our agenda
i will take good note of your question
question no  by h
subject dispute between armenia and turkey on  december  the council accepted turkey s application for accession to the european union
turkey has not acknowledged the genocide in question and is still imposing its economic blockade on armenia
what action has the council taken to encourage the development of political relations between armenia and turkey
mr president i should also like to thank the presidentinoffice of the council for his answer
this framework includes good relations with armenia especially on trade matters
these good relations and the whole framework for cooperation on which they are based are part of the acquis communautaire that turkey must accept
this has until now been a purely bilateral issue and the european union cannot therefore intervene in it
question no  by h
i would however like to mention an issue that is often overlooked
it is quite shaming that after well over six months there are eight member states still to ratify
the jordanians are particularly sensitive to the slow pace of progress
commissioner patten is determined to reinvigorate the whole barcelona process and the europeanmediterranean relationship
i hope that the council will follow that lead and ensure that this is transmitted down through the governments to the member state parliaments
this depends to a large extent on national parliaments nevertheless the portuguese presidency will certainly make the various governments aware of this issue
as the author is not present question no  lapses
question no  by h
will the council now make a statement on the issue
mr president i gather that this question refers to the issue of culture within the wto
i wish to thank the presidentinoffice for his response
that is constantly undermining what is unique not only about europe as a continent but also about the individual member states
i would like to offer mr crowley certain assurances
the position i have described reflects portugal s view of this matter and i believe that my country is not alone in its approach to this issue
the cultural question i would most like to hear answered though is this how are we proposing to handle the language issue in future
france pursues a very independent policy where the french language is concerned
do you see any evidence of similar tendencies on the part of the germans spanish or portuguese
as the authors are not present question nos  and  lapse
question no  by h
the current financial regulations do not allow for appropriations to be transferred between two headings in the financial perspectives
the council is currently studying this issue which is highly controversial
it is precisely for this reason that the idea of a review of the financial perspectives is not being considered at present
the council s view is correct payments to farmers are at stake
my question is as follows what do we do when the council says something diametrically opposed to what the commission says
mr presidentinoffice of the council what do we do in this event
that is all
 el mr president frankly the presidentinoffice leaves me speechless
in other words part of the cap budget will be redistributed
i repeat they are unused cap appropriations
the council has taken the view that the internal balance of the financial perspectives should not be changed during this phase
question no  by h
subject financial assistance to europeanlevel parties replying to my oral question h in parliament on  april  the commission took the view that
the article refers to the importance of political parties at european level
this matter should be considered at the intergovernmental conference
does the council take the same view with regard to the legal basis for this
will the matter be placed on the agenda for the igc
after this the amount type and form of support will surely be for parliament and the council to decide
in this context i would like to ask what kind of plans if any the council has regarding these practical arrangements
question no  by h
this results de facto from the fundamentally ambiguous situation in that area
 el mr president mr presidentinoffice thank you for your reply
it was most interesting
what i am hearing is quite absurd
i imagine that you are unable to defend whoever it is who takes the decisions there
except that of course they include members of the european union
i think that this situation is scandalous in every sense of the word from an international and political point of view and i wonder how you tolerate it
question no  by h
hopefully it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals
i did ask a specific question about fisheries
of course fisheries by their very nature create muchneeded jobs in coastal regions of the union
fisheries unlike any other industry depend so much on seasonality and weather factors
mr gallagher i am sorry that i did not specifically mention your point about fisheries in my answer
they think it is just another piece of paper saying how wonderful they are
for example funds to help them with training education adaptation of premises or the use of new technology
in fact the draft version of this charter will be considered by the industry council tomorrow and the charter will be published in three weeks
we will be willing to consider all the opinions of small and mediumsized enterprises
question no  by h
in greece the exclusion of physically disabled and paraplegic citizens from two competitions is causing a social and political problem
the commission s three proposals enshrine different approaches to combating discrimination
however since not everything in the garden can be rosy i am not completely satisfied at the moment
it is true that article  covers practically all possible  at the moment at least  forms of discrimination
however subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced
the presidentinoffice of the council has mentioned three examples and i would like to refer to them specifically
at world level we can be truly proud of the steps that we have taken in this area
 el mr president and mr presidentinoffice thank you for the replies which you have given us
one of these groups is the disabled
perhaps a european observatory should be created so that the specific practices of the member states and the application of european policy can be better monitored
mrs kratsatsagaropoulou i cannot add much more to what i have already said
you are concerned at the shortcomings in the way these principles are being implemented and i would say that such shortcomings will have to be rectified
question no  by h
mr president the european union has been closely following the situation in myanmar for several years
more recently at its meeting in april the council adopted three additional sanctions against the burmese regime
to this end the european union plans to send a second eu troika mission to rangoon
presidentinoffice thank you for the answer
i should prefer it if parliament avoided the term myanmar also
whilst i express my support one thing still puzzles me
we are waiting for the us to decide against these federal laws
will that remain the case
mrs kinnock i am pleased that we agree on the importance of renewing the common position
question no  by h
however ecofin remains the decisionmaking body
thank you for your answer which i think was important and valuable
this coordination does not of course mean that there is any transfer of power to the specific framework in which these discussions are held
that is how the eu works
mrs sandbaek let us be quite clear about this
what must not happen is that a country that is not part of euro  is asked to set the agenda for those that are
thank you very much mr seixas da costa
we hope that you have success with your contact with the parliamentary group on the important issue of the statute of members
since the time allocated to questions to the council has elapsed questions nos  to  will be replied to in writing
that concludes questions to the council
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
telecommunicationsradio spectrum policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
mr president ladies and gentlemen deregulation in the telecommunications sector has continued for a decade and it has been a great success
the traditional telephone as we knew it is now a fading memory
i am sure this has come as a surprise to many
deregulation created fears of a fall in standards of public services and an increase in telephone charges
this has not happened however and instead services have become diversified and prices have fallen
money to finance all this has of course been generated by new data terminal equipment networks and services
the  regulatory package was well timed and  due to its efficient implementation  worked well in several member states
in some countries however implementation has been slow and even formal
we would support action by the commission to improve crossborder services and honest competition
sufficient transparency on the specific conditions for operating licences is required so that undue delays in the approval process can be prevented
the objective is to prevent social discrimination and to increase consumer confidence and social cohesion
this initiative is impressively entitled an information society for all 
the radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource which has now started to come up for auction
we take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances
experiences from india are equally bad
those in favour of auctioning believe it to be a good means of controlling resources
this cannot be right

i should like at this point to stress that the radio spectrum is not used solely for telecommunications
it subsequently issued the communication which we are examining today on the basis of the aforementioned public consultation
your rapporteur is in favour of an overall payment for each commercial service which uses the spectrum
we must not lose sight of the consequences which such practices will have on the final user
mr president on behalf of the ppede group i wish to congratulate mr paasilinna on his report which we very much welcome
he has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hardhitting report
i want to focus on some of the key points highlighted in the report
just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market
to have an open competitive regime has now become the accepted wisdom
we will not have a developed market unless we have investment
the other issue we have to address is the ability of investors to make satisfactory returns on their investment
that is something we shall address in the next communication
we welcome this report which is really going to encourage marketopening to the benefit of consumers and the european economy
there was no such consensus previously
even foreign calls were ten per cent lower than previously
we are therefore still making quite large strides in this area
the commission is undertaking many investigations and inquiries
we need impartial information to be able to keep track of developments and as public decision makers to be able to take the necessary decisions
these two reports deal with issues both large and small
in common with previous speakers i would express my appreciation of the constructive cooperation that has taken place with the rapporteurs
the major issues are about the ways in which broadband services can be made available to everyone and about the auctions we have touched upon
in certain member states that is already the case for example in my own country finland
the auctions issue has provoked discussion and does so every day
one might well wonder if it is a question here of being penny wise and pound foolish
there is a risk of roaming for third generation mobile telephony being put in jeopardy
there may also be a risk of barriers arising between the member states
i would therefore hope that the commission is alert to this question and that we can engage in a creative discussion on the subject
mr president there has been a change over to electronic capitalism both in europe and worldwide
on the stock markets there is a gold rush for the shares of it companies  it shares are a presentday klondyke
a rapid concentration of the information industry is in progress  at the consumers expense
as we know the profit from these shares will ultimately always be generated through the prices of telephone calls
rapporteur ladies and gentlemen in  the european union undertook to open up the telecommunications market
i must say that the assessment presented to us is at least detailed
it is therefore imperative that we do not lose sight of the objective of providing a highquality service for all citizens if we want to avoid creating a fresh division within our society
the objective is admirable but we must avoid certain errors and must therefore discuss the matter very thoroughly with the national authorities
at the same time the commission must ensure that the fees collected from the operators remain under control
the eu s operating logic thus falls into two stages
the costs to the operator might become unreasonably high should the new generation mobile spectrum be auctioned
therefore beauty contests between the various operators are clearly more consumerfriendly alternatives
the differences in attitude ethos resources and the degree of independence among the national regulators are still a cause for concern
the commission is addressing many of these problems which you identify at the moment
it has the very recent recommendation on the local loop and on bundling
the commission will also use its powers in regard to competition to monitor carefully dominant positions
this is called for by market players national regulators and national administrations and has now also been unanimously mandated by the lisbon summit
at the moment the commission is preparing the sixth framework report to be adopted during 
parliament s report will provide important input
i am sure that the report will be an important benchmark as we follow the development of the information society
cable systems will be examined more closely by the commission
for that reason the commission proposes a harmonised approach
in addition political support is required to facilitate the achievement of community objectives at international level
the commission therefore welcomes the report from mr alyssandrakis
the competitiveness of european industry at global level must be developed in the interest of the european citizen
we should be able to promote without delay harmonisation measures which respond to technological and market developments
the commission will report annually to the council and the european parliament on the measures adopted
this will also take into account the results of the overall discussion which is now taking place in the  review
mrs read put a question about the balance between competition and regulation
thank you very much commissioner liikanen
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
coherent european approach for space
at the same time it has brought practical applications which have changed our lives
finally space has always had a strategic importance since whoever controls space also controls the earth
space is the one sector in which international cooperation is particularly important
the commission has made it clear that a coherent approach is indispensable for the european union
this structure comprises the space advisory group and other highlevel groups
but in addition to this it has above all generated incredible change in our everyday lives
satellites and telecommunications have been mentioned and we could add the weather forecast
today although the united states and russia still dominate this sector the countries of europe play a major and increasingly significant role
however as the rapporteur suggests it would appear necessary to extend its activities to projects launched within the community framework
a large chunk of the practical applications involving space is already controlled by the market and i feel that this is dangerous
the commission must put forward measures to control what are genuine abuses
this is the only way to achieve the consensus such a policy requires
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioners the european market for space applications is fragmented
there are many smaller companies active which do not work together very well
there is as such plenty of work for the space advice group
cooperation at community and international level in space activities is imperative
my second point concerns the position of the european satellite industry
since the end of the cold war the strategic importance of having our own satellite industry has been of commercial importance
the sector is growing by  annually and thus helping create employment
if the european union does not want to miss the boat the commission and member states need to promote the development of the industry
satellite systems are the means to further develop information and communications technology
unfortunately the european satellite industry is very much dominated by governments
more cooperation and company mergers are needed as well as more support in technology development through the framework programme among other things
all this noise is making things very difficult the sound quality is dreadful
i would appreciate it if the technicians could do something about it
thank you mrs plooijvan gorsel
the bureau has also noted that there is a problem with the sound but this problem can of course only be fixed when we are not working
let us hope that the sound quality will be better tomorrow
we need to organise the launching of low cost european union satellites to serve european industries
finally i would like to point out that pensioners should somehow be included in this space research
how can this be
well in the united states a famous pensioner the astronaut john glenn went into space at the age of 
i am  years old and in  years time i will be 
i am already a politician i could become an astronaut the first pensioner astronaut of the european union
i am booking my seat today
thank you very much commissioner busquin
the debate is closed
the vote will take place on thursday at  noon
european research area
it comes at exactly the right time between two framework programmes
at present there is no european research area as such
the research policy of the member states and that of the union are running parallel without forming a coherent unit
in addition we invest far less in research than the united states and japan
these two factors have caused the chasm between us and the united states to widen even more over the past few years
the forthcoming enlargement of the union makes this all the more pressing
the european member states need to leave behind their technological nationalism and strive more towards a european union for research and technology too
this means that european researchers need access to each other s national programmes
only  is spent on new innovative research
as such the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 
europe has no problem converting euros into research but has far greater difficulty converting research into euros
it appears that commercialisation ie injecting expertise into a product seems to be much more successful in the united states than it is in europe
a better link is required between the development of new technology and application in the market
in this respect increasing expertise is not a goal in itself but translating expertise into innovation and industrial success however is
it creates employment and prosperity
universities and companies therefore need to work more closely together
as is the case in the united states the work of scientists should alternate between academia and industry
commissioner busquin has now indicated how a european research area could be brought about
but i believe that in order to bring about a european research area we will need more than measures in the sphere of infrastructure
infrastructures do not innovate neither do electronic networks although they are a prerequisite
in my view the potential of women has been neglected for too long in this respect
my final point concerns the lack of a community patent
the existing european patent system causes fragmentation and leads to considerable extra costs
a patent application in europe is ten times more expensive than it is in the us and far more involved
not only do we not have a community patent the mechanisms to help small companies protect their patents are also lacking
will the commissioner consult mr bolkestein to do something about this
after all small and mediumsized companies do not have the means to pay for expensive legal procedures
i would like to thank my colleagues for their kind cooperation
if there is any impulse which contributes to good research it is the impulse of pure curiosity
that is something which we in europe forget at our peril
it is mentioned in clauses n and o of the preamble
i am very grateful for that
the whole is better than the sum of its two parts
it was very good of her to work it in so effectively
there is indeed a european crisis in research funding
we must increase it
legal devices are important
we should improve the european patent
they are the people at the sharp end
simplicity is all and subsidiarity means in this context simplicity and an appropriate period of research review
we also need other things
the omens are not entirely good
all that is stated in paragraph  of the report
we must also be better at developing and applying the knowledge we achieve
my colleague in edinburgh professor salter has developed a device for destroying mines safely
it has never been taken up industrially
many good ideas that are developed do not get taken up
that is also vital
i have the pleasure of shadowing mr maccormick in the legal affairs committee
anyone who has worked in research will know that if you get people together you spark new and creative ideas all the time
that activity cannot really be achieved by a lot of centralisation
the commission has a job to do as a catalyst for the process
we have now fantastic new tools to be able to do that
after all the internet was a tool intended to facilitate research networking
the second point i want to make links in with our competitiveness
we have to improve the ways that we do that
the processes of original design are prototyping testing and making
those are very important skills that we need to develop and research has a very important part to play in that
we look to you to turn these proposals into tangible ideas to achieve the objectives that we all share
as things are now resources are wasted due to overlapping and lack of coordination
the statistics indicated in the communication regarding the poor level of investment by eu countries in research are cause for concern
even worse is the fact that the gap with respect to the usa is widening
while i have the floor i would like to bring up a few additional points
i would prefer to talk about cooperation or strategy rather than research policy
the word policy has a connotation of activities being closely controlled by brussels
in research however objectives for activities should not be defined at too detailed a level
the participation of women in scientific research within the eu continues to be too fragmented
more tangible action must be incorporated in the programmes in order to promote this participation
researcher exchange programmes and interaction between research teams are matters which deserve our full support
the cost secretariat has already produced some commendable work
its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened
i wish to thank mrs plooijvan gorsel for her very dynamic work on this report
both fundamental and applied research must above all retain public support and a public dimension
europe may be a significant driving force in this field
its nuclear bias which was topical when it was set up because of the involvement of euratom must now be reconsidered
in this respect there is also a need for serious thinking about the stoa
in conclusion i wish to thank our commissioner mr philippe busquin for undertaking as soon as he arrived this investigation into a european research area which we support
clearly the development of research within the european union is one of the keys to the future
the twentyfirst century will be the century of knowledge and grey matter
in the broadest sense then research will more than ever be a fundamental element of future development
according to the figures made available by the commission europe is definitely lagging behind the united states
on this subject the proposals of both the commission and the plooijvan gorsel report lead me to make a few observations
the first is that european investment in research is at least as important as the european research area
in the united states there is rather less concern for semantics and more for practical action
research is first and foremost a matter for freedom and not for planning
this is all included in the commission communication and the report by our fellow member
there is however no prioritisation in the proposals and this is something i would like to suggest
this prioritisation should focus primarily on researchers and businesses
as far as researchers are concerned their standard of living throughout europe must be enhanced
as far as businesses are concerned research work must be encouraged
this is what our approach must be
so the area 
the president cut the speaker off
mr president i wish to thank mrs plooijvan gorsel for her usual very good report
i thank the commissioner whose timing is very good and so is his idea of launching this debate
there is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in european science and research
we are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation
frankly the eu is not punching its weight in research although some member states are very good
i would name finland sweden and countries like the republic of ireland which have made good progress
it is itself a centre of excellence in many areas
we look forward to regular reports from the commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project
i would like to congratulate the commissioner on his ambition which is considerable
trying to create a european research area is an ambitious plan because this research space is currently lacking and we only have ourselves to blame
this is evident to all of us yet our governments fail to set aside sufficient funds
this is true for the member states and regions some of whose percentage levels are shamefully low
we should as it were sound the praises of certain member states and regions but should not work on averages
this is why it is good to emphasise cooperation
cooperation however requires organisation
and really the absence of this is something we only have ourselves to blame for
if our organisation of the scientific environment lags behind we will not achieve a european research area
we cannot do this to the commissioner either
dear commissioner what a challenge
we will keep fighting in order to overcome that red tape which tends to delay the achievement of these goals
on  june two nobel prizewinners rita levi montalcini holder of the nobel prize for neuroscience and renato dulbecco will pay tribute to this initiative in recognition of the fact that at long last in establishing the research area you have conferred great honour on all research scientists
investment in research and in cooperation must lead to more economic growth and more employment
but i would prefer it if we were a little more precise in our debate
we have to ascertain that not all research leads to more economic growth or more employment
in these particular areas european cooperation is meaningful
the joint research centres the jrcs have many examples of sound cooperation projects
in many research areas the jrc researchers find themselves in a situation much like a spider in a web
there is also great demand for applied research which can be expected to have a far greater impact on employment
but european policy could restrict itself to creating appropriate conditions and practical obstacles should be cleared away
i would like to finish off by saying a few words on basic research
research situated between applied and basic research now has a lower profile but remains significant
many fundamental questions in the fields of natural and life sciences remain unanswered
it is precisely in these spheres that coordination of national research efforts is of major importance
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for her invaluable work
the role of the sme sector as a locomotive force for innovation and research work must also be clearly borne in mind
the commission s communication provides an unnecessarily onesided view of the challenges of european research
it is obvious that in the preparation of this communication there has been no horizontal utilisation of the expertise of the various directorates
it is not enough to talk in broad terms about the competitiveness of the union
keywords in research policy are flexibility global thinking and the more effective use of resources than at present
we have effectively entered the knowledge society which has led us to put research back at the heart of our society
in europe however as many people have said the position of research looks worrying if one looks at the figures
it is therefore necessary as a matter of urgency to adopt an overall strategy at european level in order to make up for lost time
it is not a matter of casting doubt on the efficiency of the frdps their results are plain to see
i am speaking therefore to voice their concerns for we are not training enough scientific researchers and even fewer european researchers
the training of researchers should therefore include a european dimension which would offer them greater mobility
i am the only person from that committee who is speaking in this debate
i very much regret the fact that the contribution of the committee on culture has not been allowed to enrich the debate
in this respect i would like to offer some constructive criticism
in europe there are no training programmes for researchers
feder and the feder projects do not cover grant holders
the personnel available to us include very few postdoctoral teachers and we do not have sufficient staff
how can we talk about mobility if we do not have researchers
i repeat that we must recycle our teachers
only by means of a strategic european resources plan can we do so
lastly i would like to express my fear that only centres of excellence will be recognised
mr president i will confine myself to stressing three points tackled by commissioner busquin which are also referred to in the report under debate
the first concerns the close relationship between research economic growth and employment
point two research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system
in some areas it is not easy to distinguish between basic and applied research
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i would like to add my thanks to those that have been expressed already
i should also like to thank mrs plooijvan gorsel for the excellent report she has drawn up within a very short time limit
we are at a juncture which gives us hope that greater and more crucial progress may be made in this area
this is the significance of all these networks of centres of excellence that must be created without necessarily specifying the exact infrastructures involved
as regards fundamental and applied research i think this is a matter of balance
these two aspects are closely linked
in order to create the necessary dynamic it is therefore essential to develop the concept of benchmarking
i think establishing a patent is a condition sine qua non as has been adequately pointed out
mr bolkestein who is responsible for the internal market is well aware of this
finally as far as small and mediumsized businesses are concerned the matter of the patent is a crucial factor quite apart from more specific elements
so to be brief i should simply like to inform parliament of the forthcoming stages
the first stage is clear
i would first of all like to emphasise just how important it was that parliament expressed its opinion today
the next stage then is the council of ministers responsible for research which will take place on  june
this report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display
for i have clearly understood that practical action is needed
so regarding the practical action let me quickly list a few points starting with benchmarking
with national research policies the methodology exists
i think that the member states accept this methodology with the establishment of a high level group of representatives
initial results will be available by the end of the year
a map of areas of excellence in europe is being drawn up with the cooperation of the national specialist institutes
that is no surprise to anyone i think
i am hopeful that this map will also be ready by the end of the year
the mobility of researchers presupposes the mobility of workers in general
the ambition of mrs diamantopoulou and myself is to set up a group made up of representatives from each member state in order to identify where the obstacles lie
regarding women and science in fact on the initiative of parliament a sizeable group of five hundred women has been set up
finally as regards electronic networks mr liikanen and i wish to increase these to several gigabytes very soon
i do however wish to express my heartfelt thanks for the interest you have shown in this debate
i hope that together we shall be able to open up the european research area that i believe in so strongly
thank you very much for your contribution commissioner
given the time we should not hold lengthy discussions
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
peking action platform
as such it is an important report because it will be the only report from the european parliament
europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this
but before i talk about this pioneering role i would like to say a few words about the assessment itself
no statistical data exists
after all there is an enormous gap in this field
i would like to direct my second point to parliament itself
it may be useful that we together with the women involved should take an initiative
that is all i have to say as regards assessment and i will not touch on it any further
this was also said a moment ago
there is still a chasm between men and women in terms of wages
another theme is decision making
the commission has made efforts as has europe but mainly in the political sphere
i think that efforts should also be made with regard to both sides of industry
far more attention should be paid to them since they manage and control a large part of social life
on the theme of violence too little attention is being paid to violence within the family in my opinion
attention is being paid to violence in the work sphere and so forth but not so much within the family
in my view more attention should be paid to the media which is such a determining factor in social life
women are very much absent in the media
finally i already said that europe is expected to play a pioneering role
i would mention two areas in particular
we are now familiar with this
we know that in many developing countries the economy is carried by women and we support this
this much we now know
what is happening in afghanistan is unjustifiable
the social changes of recent years have affected women in a special way
the majority and in many cases all of the responsibility for domestic tasks falls to women
men will have to take more family responsibilities and adapt to a society which is constantly changing and which has modified their traditional roles
if the number of women involved in decision making were to increase it would become easier to resolve the problems facing them
this is a form of violence against their person their fundamental rights and their dignity
the cooperation of the media is essential to achieving these objectives
mr president half the sky is borne on the shoulders of women  a successful man once said
but the heavens are not enough
that is unacceptable
just about all the governments of the world endorsed the beijing conference s action plan
a threefold strategy is needed if the conference is not just to be another exercise in rhetoric
first of all the world s governments must adopt a concrete action plan and again undertake to fulfil the beijing objectives
these three tools have so far been missing in implementing the beijing action platform
this is something which the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities wants to change
is that not so commissioner
mr president we are going to new york first and foremost to discuss the position of women globally
women are to a very great extent the victims and those who suffer in wars now
would it not be a good idea to debate what could be done by women to prevent or resolve these kind of presentday conflicts
i should like however to point out a number of things
economic independence for women is a necessity if it is to be possible to achieve true equality
women both within and outside the european union are especially vulnerable to poverty
these are points which religious fundamentalists of different kinds now refuse to accept
they are thereby sabotaging constructive dialogue between governments and voluntary organisations
the european commission will once again therefore be conspicuous for its grand proposals and the failure to follow them up with tangible actions
we feel that out of the vast amount of issues to be considered female circumcision warrants particular attention
this is a major issue a practice so common and widespread that it is featuring increasingly even in the european daily media
the european union and the member states must be on the front line of this fight
 el mr president i should like to start by congratulating mrs groner and mrs smet on their exceptional and remarkable report
five years on from beijing we shall be assessing the past five years
as the speakers have said a great deal has been done and a great deal remains to be done
one question which arises is whether or not we have the information needed at european union level
that was the reason for the delay
and of course there is the traditional problem of the representation of women which all the speakers have already touched on
i think that these are the basic points which need to be assessed and more importantly where we need to renew our commitments
i should like to stress that beijing will obviously give rise to negotiating problems
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at  noon
the sitting was closed at  pm
address by mr kucan president of the republic of slovenia
this is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here mr president and i am very pleased to do so
just ten years ago on  april  the first free democratic elections were held in slovenia a high point in the slovene spring
this spring contained the seeds of the confrontations and tensions of the summer of  during which slovenia won its independence
we are all of course still mindful of the images of those ten dramatic days in the summer of 
and a free and democratic slovenia was born
these essential values of our european civilisation form the inalienable foundation for our joint actions present and future
the european union is first and foremost a community based on values
and now slovenia belongs to the greater european family which we hope to bring together in the near future
in  the association agreement enabled us to set up a joint european parliamentslovene parliament parliamentary committee
on  june  your country submitted its formal application for membership of the european union
i am therefore particularly pleased to welcome you here today
you are most welcome mr president and without further ado i shall give you the floor
 madam president honourable members i am honoured to be able to speak in this august house
that was the day when the process of european integration began
it is your and our common european day of celebration and i offer you my sincere congratulations
i congratulate you with trust and faith in the european idea of association i am confirmed in this faith by the recent very successful visit by the distinguished president of the european parliament mrs fontaine to slovenia
in her address to the slovene parliament mrs fontaine expressed her clear commitment to furthering the project of a united europe saying it is important that we support the will to strengthen the special features of each of our countries
this idea seems to me particularly important for it emphasises coexistence
coexistence is the only real alternative for the future of humankind including that of europe
yet the question is what will coexistence be founded upon
these are the laws of the global community
for the moment the global community seems limited to markets economies and information and communication technology
politics is lagging behind this trend
this would be a kind of world domestic politics  to which all countries would be bound
in the ruins of the berlin wall however traces of new divisions are appearing in europe
in real life several europes exist
some of them will not get there without help
there also exists a group of countries that for the moment do not wish to join the eu
they would prefer to toy with the project of a new ideological division of europe
we may call this the fourth europe
the possibility of bloody military clashes is still real
this puts pressure on fundamental values and threatens coexistence and our common future
insensitivity to these phenomena would create new barriers between us
we are reminded of this by the experience we carry with us
there are ever increasing signs of the emergence of two classes in society
the world is beginning to divide in a new way
they are threatened with social exclusion stagnation and marginalisation
on the other hand there are those who have the necessary education and are therefore guaranteed a future
this is a new phenomenon which was identified recently at the eu conference in lisbon on social cohesion
it is clear that today everyone in europe is faced with the same problems and we are all responding to them
of course we are not responding in entirely the same way
nevertheless it is essential that in seeking answers we all proceed from the same value system
the common cornerstones of values for coexistence have been established
now everyone must be afforded the chance to live in accordance with those values
this frame of mind would be the best guarantee that intolerance and enmity remain a marginal phenomenon
such an event would demand common action without wavering or compromise
the nato intervention in kosovo is perhaps the first step in this direction
the value of fundamental human rights was placed above the value of classic state sovereignty
it is becoming a subject of responsibility for the international community
whether this marks the beginning of a new chapter in international relations and international law only time will tell
europe and in particular the eu should not be in two minds about this
now it is the turn of countries that in the great division of the world belonged to the former ideological east of europe
it is the turn of countries that because of this have lagged behind in their economic development
it would also indicate that europe is abandoning its influence and presence in the world
alongside this new qualitative step forward doubts are emerging among the members of the eu
they are moving from the entirely known to the not entirely known
the decision on enlargement carries with it entirely new risks and there must be a degree of understanding for the dilemma facing the eu
could it be perhaps that once again the special interests of individual member states are rising to the surface
dilemmas doubts and uncertainties are also emerging among the candidate countries
with its back to the wall slovenia signed the socalled spanish compromise 
this time slovenia does not wish to accept this kind of imposition of conditions and expects understanding and sympathy from the european union
slovenia is a small nation
for many centuries we lived in a multinational political community in the austrohungarian empire and in two yugoslavias
the worst thing of all was the aggression during the time of the nazi and fascist occupation
our right to existence as a nation was taken away
life in diversity is the key to success for european association and slovenia has tied its future to this
in order for the current goals to be achieved negotiations should be concluded next year
we are convinced that the current progress in negotiations should make this possible
i would like finally to stress that i do not see globalisation and european integration as unification
the positive effects of these processes are interdependent on the simultaneously establishing freedom of individuation and fragmentation
only respect for such freedoms can be the foundation of european coexistence
this involves establishing the principle of unity in diversity 
the alternative is clear
in the first decade of the new century and millennium democratic europe is also facing new trials
my firm conviction is that united europeans could be more than a match for these trials
thank you mr president for addressing us in forceful committed and frank terms
you mentioned the fiftieth anniversary of the declaration by robert schuman which parliament has indeed celebrated formally
thank you too for mentioning the visit i made to ljubljana a few weeks ago
let me finally tell you that parliament would i feel very broadly agree with the views you have expressed
you also mentioned unity in diversity
finally mr president you mentioned the values you hold dear and which form the basis of european integration
you also mentioned the hope that we would not lose sight of social solidarity in the context of globalisation
once again i think your views are in total accord with the objectives of the european parliament
i wish you and also the slovene authorities participating in the negotiations the very best of luck
we sincerely hope that these negotiations will come to a successful conclusion within the expected time limits
we wish you good luck mr president and we thank you once again for coming here today and addressing us
the formal sitting was closed at  pm
we cannot create a europe which does not condemn the atrocities perpetrated by communism and nazism
clearly there is no question mark over any of this and therefore i also consider that it would be appropriate for you to obtain clarification of the issue
we entrust the matter to your wisdom and authority
thank you mrs napoletano
statements by the president
i have two statements to make
the quaestors acted quickly to resolve this situation in the best way possible
i thank the quaestors and particularly the president of the college mr poos for their prompt action
you should therefore have received this statement by email
this committee has on several occasions examined all the aspects particularly the legal ones of this issue
i thank mrs palacio the committee s chairperson and the committee members for their efforts
so that there is no room for error or misinterpretation i would prefer to read you the letter
these are the contents of the letter sent to me yesterday evening by mrs palacio on behalf of the legal affairs committee
once again i thank her
i intend to abide by the opinion of the legal affairs committee
madam president i am taking the floor to request that parliament express its opinion in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure
if you will allow me i will justify my proposal
go ahead mr baron crespo
one of them is respect for parliamentary rules and the treaties
the president cut the speaker off
i am going to suspend the sitting for a few moments as it seems that one of our colleagues is feeling ill
the sitting was suspended at  am and resumed at  am
i thank the two members who are doctors for taking immediate action and for giving me this information
this sort of thing could happen to any of us so we definitely need to do something
madam president we have all been deeply distressed by the illness of our colleague
we have to recognise that particularly when the weather gets as hot as it did this week colleagues health is under a great deal of stress
it is unfortunate that it took a considerable time to get the stretcher to take mr staes out of the chamber
many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat
thank you mrs banotti
i believe there are no age limits for this type of illness
i am very satisfied with the time that was taken and the action of parliament s medical services
madam president maybe at long last we will decide that the medical services should not be placed in the basement
they would prefer to be on the same floor as the plenary session and maybe we could actually look into that
ladies and gentlemen we trust that the quaestors will look into the matter
however we have all made a free choice
i will return to the issue we were discussing my group s request for this house to express its opinion in accordance with the regulations
france is a constitutional state
i have heard  because i do not have firsthand knowledge of the letter  that precedents are cited
there certainly are precedents and my group believes they should be respected
i do not wish to enter into a debate on french law since i have no knowledge of it
madam president i am speaking as coordinator for the socialist group in the european parliament s committee on legal affairs and the internal market
i was very surprised by the letter which you have just read from the chairperson of the legal affairs committee
the possibility of giving an explanation was raised and i argued that that would mean a new vote
this is because in our statutory law in our rules of procedure there is no explicit mention of how to proceed in a situation such as this
secondly i wish to point out that there is doubtless confusion here
madam president you have consulted the legal affairs committee on the basis of a purely formal decision
i respect what mr baron crespo says
his views were discussed and examined in depth by the legal affairs committee
allow me to refer to what was said in this committee
it makes no sense now to look into the reason for the sentence
the sentence exists
the fact that it involves ineligibility is what concerns us
please allow me now to refute mr medina s statement on his interpretation of the matter
however in my capacity as chairperson i must point out that the two letters are complementary
in the second paragraph it said tomorrow we will continue to discuss this issue 
there was therefore no place for a vote on the issue and i had stated that on the previous day
the vote had already taken place in the legal affairs committee
furthermore the minutes also show that i said that a committee chairperson rarely obtained such a degree of unanimity with regard to a proposal
i say this in order to refute these statements
i would now like to make a comment in relation to the rules of procedure
madam president rule  is being cited
madam president there is no proposal to the plenary here
noise
it is absolutely irregular and contrary to the rule that has been cited
applause
protests
it is in the nature of all decisions in plenary that they be taken from a political point of view in this case we are talking about a purely formal legal assessment
protests
madam president you can consult any other internal body and in particular 
the president cut the speaker off
 the conference of group chairmen however the house cannot consider this proposal in these circumstances
protests and the president cut the speaker off
ladies and gentlemen we are not going to repeat the discussions of the legal affairs committee
i accept full responsibility in this matter
under the terms of the treaty i could no doubt have quite simply noted the decree
this is how parliament must always act in a very rigorous manner
however from the moment when the european parliament officially takes note of the decree the decision will immediately become enforceable
you can imagine the problems this would cause
this is therefore an extremely important responsibility for both your president and this house
once again i thank the committee for the long hours which its chairperson and members have devoted to this matter
now that i have this opinion i could ignore it
however although my decision may be disputed i have decided to abide by the committee s opinion
this effectively is what our rules of procedure say
this is my proposal
we are not going to spend the whole morning on this
i would ask you to be brief and we will then take whatever seems to be the best decision
this decision is yours to make as this is a very serious issue
i would remind you that it is in fact parliament which will officially take note of the decree and not its president
we are fully aware of the political sensitivity of this issue
we do not however want this issue to be used against us for political purposes
mrs hautala we must be very clear on this
it is not a question of voting to waive anybody s immunity
we now have this proposal and rule  itself states that on a proposal from that committee parliament may adopt a position on the matter 
is this now clear to everyone
mixed reactionsbut the letter will be provided to you
i speak as the coordinator of the eldr group on the legal affairs committee
this is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules
mixed reactions this is what happened
whether this is a good or bad thing it is a situation which i felt i had to clarify
madam president i wish to raise a procedural motion
i must remind mr wurtz that a tribunal does not deliver judgements
a court delivers judgements
he should brush up on his legal knowledge
that apart the legal affairs committee rightfully discussed this issue and mr wurtz was not there
as a result he is illplaced to criticise a confusion which did not exist
there was political confusion but no legal confusion
the position of the legal affairs committee was simple
the decision is not final and therefore cannot be accepted
if you decide that a vote must be held in this parliament this cannot occur without a committee report
ladies and gentlemen i have received many requests to speak
we absolutely must find the best solution
it appears that the council of state s decision on the stay of execution will be taken imminently 
we are now in a difficult position
personally i must abide by the rules of procedure which state that on a proposal from that committee parliament may adopt a position on the matter 
we must resolve this situation
i will therefore immediately put the two possible solutions to the vote
we do not have such a document
that is why i urge you not to hold a vote on this matter now in any way whatsoever
madam president ladies and gentlemen i appeal to mr baron crespo and the socialist group
the president is right
i do not often agree with mrs garaud but in this case she is right
there is a contradiction in french law which states that a decision is not final and not suspensive
understand that if you can but it is up to the french parliament to reform this law
the european parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision
this is my conception of europe
this can happen very quickly
this would not be a decision on the substance even though it is purely a legal matter but on the form
i would therefore ask you to withdraw your request for a vote so that we do not reach a total impasse
we should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind
my second point is that you decided on the basis of rule  to consult the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
that is your right
there is a legal problem here that only you can clear up
there is a discrepancy here
my advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy
that is your task madam president
there is nothing we can vote on until you have cleared this up with the committee on legal affairs
applause
i agree with mr hansch
this is the best solution for everyone
equal treatment
the latter madam president was unfortunately not the case
as i understand the french version was still not available this morning
i suggest postponing the debate and vote on this extremely important report to the next partsession
madam president on a point of order
i wish to make three brief points
this matter was signalled clearly at the conference of presidents last week  on more than one occasion i understand
i myself was absent but i have had this confirmed to me
that is my first question
he is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule if he should so wish
it is my understanding that all the documents and amendments in all languages were finally available about  pm yesterday
i should like to have that confirmed
there is one point that to many of us is the issue of substance in this report
we have under the treaties the power now to bring in new antidiscrimination legislation
the portuguese presidency will organise a social affairs council which we can engage with if we deliver a view
thank you mr cox
it is quite clear that we are not within the time limit established in rule 
i regret that the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats have quoted rule  because the last version of the text which was the french one was actually issued at  am
it is now  hours later
maybe they need this last half hour to prepare for their debate but it does seem that they seized on this as a rather lame excuse
mr poettering the law affecting any given issue is subject to interpretation
that is another issue
mr oostlander this situation clearly comes under rule  and mr cox s proposal takes account of this rule
mr cox please restate your proposal as the deadlines in rule  must be respected
we agree
i am now looking to see whether the deadlines would be respected in this case
they would
i therefore put mr cox s proposal as accepted by the rapporteur to the vote
i would ask you to accept this request
a rollcall vote is possible on this issue as the compromise proposed by mr cox respects the rules of procedure
parliament gave its assent the debate on mrs buitenweg s report will take place at  pm
mr president just one specific question when will the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance start given that it was quite definitely and firmly set for  to  pm
this really is a mess
at what time will it start
i have a right to know
trafficking in women
this report is also a reaction to the excellent communication by the committee on new measures to fight trafficking in women
trafficking in children does exist but they are used as adults
men too are victims of trafficking in people and are sexually abused
in fact the sex industry is not the only market on which the victims of such trafficking are sold
victims are also recruited for the marriage market as well as to sports clubs and football clubs
the huge profits and relative safety for the perpetrators who generate this type of crime will undoubtedly have something to do with this
the penalties for smuggling narcotics for example are far higher than those for trafficking in women
victims are often unable to speak out on account of the illegal situation they are in
in order to tackle trafficking in people adequately we first of all need a clear definition of trafficking in people
various initiatives have already been taken at european level
some countries which have strict legislation on prostitution do not even have any legislation at all on trafficking in people
by introducing the stop programme europe is striking while the iron is hot and opportunities for collaboration have opened up
as i said trafficking in people is not just about the problem of demand for prostitution
the initiatives which have been taken are the first step towards a solution but the number of victims continues to grow
a great deal therefore remains to be done
we have submitted proposals on prevention reception of victims and legislation
 fr mr president this report is vitally important
we are profoundly affected by the tragedy of trafficking in women which is a modern form of slavery
our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims
we must fight to eliminate all the links in the chain namely recruitment transport managers middlemen and clients
women and children are being traded like goods and doomed to prostitution
misfortune misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries
they are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married
they have no idea of the miserable conditions in which they will be exploited beaten tortured and threatened
over half of the victims are under the age of  and around  are between  and 
trafficking in women involves terrible sexual exploitation
we must help these victims to speak out and denounce their living conditions
we must welcome and help them
when they resist the pressure of traffickers and pimps they are threatened either personally or through their families
the traffickers belong to a mafialike criminal organisation and control several links in the network that has power over the victim
some even go as far as committing suicide
fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this
we should not forget that trafficking has economic roots
we demand a coherent european policy which is why this report is so important
trafficking in women is a crime trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation are unworthy of humanity
mr president it has already been said
we are touching upon an important topic here namely that of people s dignity
men girls and boys are also involved
it is a growing problem in the eu too
trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative
women are often easy prey given the poor conditions they live under
trafficking in women is increasingly linked with international criminal organisations
i hope it will be possible to adopt the amendment on nongovernmental organisations tabled by our group and amended in consultation with the greens
these groups do not always get the recognition they deserve
the amendment states that ngos can also include ideologicallybased organisations
finally i would like to state that this is an important communication from the commission
it is a sound communication and a sound report on which i would like to congratulate mrs sorensen
i hope that the member states will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it
the real scandal is that we not only tolerate it in europe but we contribute to its expansion
unfortunately the institutions search for solutions is progressing very slowly and the problem is growing
in any event we should recognise that the european commission s proposals are on the whole reasonable and hopefully useful
poverty social inequality and armed conflict explain migratory flows
so let us analyse assess and implement genuine development and integration policies
mr president i would like to start by congratulating mrs sorensen
not only is she proficient she is also extremely committed to the subject matter
the fact that she managed to put this important topic on the european agenda is a huge achievement
trafficking in women has been overlooked for too long and politicians underestimate its importance
this actually happened in the netherlands not least thanks to the efforts of secretary of state verstand
unfortunately many member states still do not have national rapporteurs and they really should remedy this as soon as possible
at the same time legislation as well as cooperation are inadequate
there are however two points which may seem commendable but to which we are unfortunately unable to subscribe
the first concerns automatic refugee status for victims of trafficking in women
in our opinion this is a bridge too far because this would require the entire geneva convention to be overturned
we do find it important however that it should be possible to grant residence permits on humanitarian grounds
we will therefore continue to support this proposal
our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof
this principle is important in a constitutional state
the concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace
to incorporate this principle into criminal law would be a huge step
liberals attach great importance to legal protection and we are not prepared to take that step now
finally the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency
this is why it would be wrong to weigh down this discussion with moral judgements on prostitution as certain people here are attempting to do
if we do this it will make the discussion infinitely more complex and will get in the way of effective measures against the trafficking in women
this should not happen
the problem is urgent and effective measures are required
not just words but deeds are what are needed now
there are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for mrs sorensen has been concerned for over  years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution
in these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women prostitution and pimping
there is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate
we must listen to them
there are nonetheless two things we do not entirely agree with
the first concerns the role of the sex industry in this issue
almost throughout the report the term enforced prostitution is used
however the use of this term implies that there is an opposite that is to say voluntary prostitution
that is very strange especially when we are talking about slavery and trafficking in women
the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left has tabled a few amendments some of them on this subject and in connection with which we naturally hope that we shall receive support
i would again thank mrs sorensen and all our colleagues
unfortunately this is unlikely to be the last time we debate this issue even though it is so far only the second time we have done so
raising such an issue today might seem anachronistic but slavery will indeed be a part of the st century
trafficking in human beings is after drugs and weapons the third largest source of income for organised crime
yet trafficking in human beings is above all a violation of human dignity and human rights
our societies are demanding the right to happiness pleasure and freedom and the removal of taboos
it seems not to matter if people women and children in particular are paying the price by being dragged down into the underworld
prostitution is a form of slavery which we like to make out to be exotic and romantic in order to hide its tragedy and sordidness
yet it is actually a denial of freedom
so much the better for the resignation shown towards what society has deemed to be irreversible is intolerable
these measures which have already been successfully implemented in some states must be extended to cover the whole of the european union
is it not the very fact of prohibition which renders the phenomenon it is intended to control uncontrollable tragic and inhuman
mr president ladies and gentlemen simply raising a problem is an admission of its gravity
some   victims of the traffic in human beings arrive each year in western europe
given the current state of legislation we are faced with a wide diversity of penal traditions in our member states
establishing specific offences at community level would therefore lead to an impasse
instead we must take inspiration from the method in the schmid report on combating fraud and counterfeiting of noncash means of payment
we shall now proceed to the votes
mr president there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence
on the other hand the british delegation which is now  members has retabled the resolution in its original form
the debate will take place as proposed
the exact time will be announced later
vote
mr president i am very surprised at the order of voting here
i would ask you to reverse it so that the compromise resolution by four groups including the two biggest groups comes first
mr purvis the way we work is that the first resolution tabled is the first taken
mr president the resolution by the green group was tabled first
let us proceed with the vote and not reopen the debate
parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution
motion for a resolution b by ms ahern and others on safety problems at british nuclear fuels sellafield site
parliament rejected the motion for a resolution
joint motion for a resolution on falsification of data concerning mox fuels at sellafield
parliament adopted the joint resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
joint motion for a resolution on the external debt of poor countries
parliament adopted the joint resolution
joint motion for a resolution on the situation in zimbabwe
parliament adopted the joint resolution
i say this in relation to the provan report and the reform of the voting system in parliament
i believe this is an unacceptable way to proceed
as a result i will not take part in any vote on this report
i do not want to have a debate on this
i do not want to dig the rules up
my own memory of the rules is that you should do it before votes as well
i also have a financial interest in telecom and space so i will not participate in the vote
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
after the adoption of two amendmentsford glyn pse
mr president on a point of order
these two amendments are very similar to those which were rejected in committee
could we be clear that the rapporteur is giving the committee s view and not his own
i think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee
parliament adopted the resolution
mr president i wanted to make the following suggestion
a number of amendments have been tabled which were in fact already in the text when the vote was taken in committee
with your help i would like to try to tidy up the report a little and remove a number of redundant items
this is a tidyingup exercise
are there any objections to that oral amendment
parliament accepted the oral amendment
mr baron crespo is this a formal request on behalf of the socialist group
we can only vote here on things that have really been worked through in committee
it really is unacceptable to work like this in this chamber
this is a report which had to be produced in great haste
two committees made substantial input to it
it may be that in the end there will be some redundancy but there are different points being made
last night the commissioner gave no indication that he found anything ambiguous or difficult
it is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list
i would like to thank everyone for their comments but i agree most with the comment made by mr hansch
maybe it is useful occasionally to look at how we set about things here in parliament
this seems a very enjoyable exercise
i do not want to start another debate
the bureau is looking at the working methods of parliament
you will all receive a copy of mr provan s excellent discussion document in the near future
whereas perhaps owing to my curious accent it was transcribed as biannual  which would require two reports a year and would be overegging the pudding
i therefore request that this be orally amended to biennial 
parliament accepted the oral amendment
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
president
that concludes the vote
we are proposing at  pm to have a debate on the buitenweg report followed by the debate on items of topical and urgent debate
that will be the agenda
mr president on a point of order
could you explain what the situation is
i accept that it is unsatisfactory that groups can withdraw their requests at any stage
all i can suggest is a beltandbraces approach
if you want to ensure that there is a roll call make a request on behalf of your own group as well
i accept that it is not a very satisfactory situation
there must be a chance to do this if another group withdraws its request
that was the point here
this is a matter for the committee on constitutional affairs
under the present rules there is nothing to stop members withdrawing their requests for rollcall votes
mr president i did not understand what was to happen with mrs sorensen s report
will the debate continue following the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
otherwise when is it intended that the debate should take place
you did not say that this was to be the case however and i should therefore like to have it confirmed
that is correct
as normal after the votes we will continue with the debates and the first two are sorensen and karamanou
so we will carry on with the debates
mr president i would also like to say a few words on the order of business for this afternoon
you have indicated that we will start with the buitenweg report at  pm and that we will vote at  pm
this seems unacceptable to me
that is correct and that is what the house has agreed to so that is what we will be doing
mr president i rise on a similar point because i am not clear what the house has agreed to
we have agreed to vote at  pm
mr ford that is not a matter for the president
what we have decided is to allocate the first hour of what normally would have been the urgency debate to the buitenweg report
the house did that earlier
that was a decision for the house
the house is sovereign in these matters
it is then up to the groups to decide how they allocate speaking time for the urgency debates
if we have enough time we will do all the debates if we do not we will not
mr president we agreed that we would take the debate on buitenweg not that we would spend one hour on it
it was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate let us be clear on that
you are right
i said an hour
it was a slip of the tongue
i believe it is scheduled for an hour and a half
again it will depend on members discipline something that this house is renowned for
mr president on a point of order
i refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by mrs fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building
in the interests of transparency and information to members we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella
could you provide us with information on that
what procedures have been put in place
has the airconditioning system now been switched off
can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system
i personally am not in a position to answer any of your questions
i have no information on this subject
you will have to refer the matter to the president and to the quaestors
i will certainly draw attention to your remarks
explanations of vote  ferber report a
mr president i was unable to assent to the ferber report
from parliament s viewpoint there is always a reason to ask for more money for our own operations
but the european union will not become more democratic if the european parliament receives more funding
public opinion within europe requires us to be frugal
this is why i have voted in favour of amendment no 
it is essential that the european parliament be well prepared for the forthcoming enlargement to include central and eastern europe
this should coincide with the timely training of professional and highly skilled translators and interpreters
as previous enlargements have shown it is not viable to wait for this to happen
multilingualism is a prerequisite for the smooth running of the european parliament for three reasons
firstly on account of the principle of equality according to which all members must be able to carry out their work under the same conditions
secondly due to the democratic legitimacy of the european parliament
the european parliament is the democratic representation of the people
thirdly because of the requirement of usefulness
multilingualism boosts the efficiency of parliamentary work
in order to give concrete form to this requirement of multilingualism we need a debate as a matter of urgency
whichever is adopted it is clear that linguistic preparation for enlargement should not be postponed any longer

as a result it is up to us to reflect and to act wisely and carefully without upsetting any sensibilities but also without wasting any time
finally whereas one of these languages is particularly important in europe the other two are used worldwide
 nl democracy inevitably costs a great deal of money
we are voting on a parliament budget to the tune of nearly eur  billion
a huge sum although it remains within the agreed  of the estimate for all european institutions put together
we owe it to the citizens of europe  the taxpayers who have to produce this kind of capital  to keep the costs in check
indeed the european parliament has no need at all for the building in which we are meeting this week
we have everything we need in brussels in terms of facilities
recently more than  members once again stated that we want to decide for ourselves where we meet
this parliament should be deeply ashamed of the fact that one year after the elections this is still not even in sight
the budget line suggested by the court of auditors for european parties is really not necessary
allembracing budget lines of this kind blur our cultural and political diversity and increase the distance between ourselves and the citizen
secondly that each mep has documents in his language at his disposal
thirdly that we in this way are not only treating the members equally but above all the citizens we represent
the european parliament now has three places of work brussels luxembourg and strasbourg
this was agreed by the heads of state and government at their summit in edinburgh years ago
the idea is to keep at most the specialist services such as the printing and translating services in luxembourg
this cannot and will not happen
i have a word of warning for those people who are using these salami tactics against strasbourg and brussels
katiforis report a
in my opinion it is absolutely unacceptable that the elderly continue to be blamed for national budgetary difficulties
the rapporteur was unable to include the stability programme which has now been presented by the austrian government in his report
the old government led by the social democrats certainly did not bequeath it an easy task
however all the commitments in the stability pact should now be fully met for the year 
the katiforis report is a crude apology for the broad economic policy guidelines of the member states
of its  paragraphs eight start by showing approval and four by being selfcongratulatory
once again the council and commission are acting on behalf of employers and are asking parliament to give its backing to this
as a result we have voted against the report
i approved mr katiforis s approach and arguments in committee
i was due to say this yesterday during the debate in plenary but a technical problem prevented me from doing so for which i apologise
like mr katiforis i am delighted to see renewed growth in europe
i am not satisfied with everything on which we voted at midday but i have supported the rapporteur in the final vote
i must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work
the broad guidelines of european economic policy developed in this report seem to be heading in the right direction
full employment and the transition to a knowledgebased economy form our common aim for the first decade of the st century
whether or not the pessimists like this all the economic lights are on green
we must therefore be bold in order to continue the growth now being witnessed at european level
this last point clearly poses the main problem
i voted in favour of the report by mr katiforis because i believe in this europe
the katiforis report is an incredible demonstration of the lack of awareness among european capitalists
despite this convenient denial the report proposes to plunge further into social regression
it proposes increased flexibility in the markets starting with the labour market
it calls for wage stability and exhorts the unions to adopt reasonable attitudes in wage negotiations
so as not to appear to be the direct spokesperson for employers the report tries to include some social clauses
how can wages be restricted in a spirit of fairness when profits reveal unashamed exuberance
the only other argument in the report invokes the use of new technologies to bring about modernisation
but why should these automatically be allowed to threaten the european social model
we have therefore voted against a text which is both foolish and repugnant
for workers there is wage moderation a reduction in unemployment benefits and a relaxation of employment protection legislation
two points have particularly shaken us
can you believe it
since when has growth been rejected in the name of outdated economic dogmas
rather it is a sinking currency and nor do they have confidence in the european monetary authorities
wim duisenberg is not allan greenspan the ecb is not the federal reserve and the euro is not the dollar
europe has neither the employment rate nor the growth rate of the usa and it will take more than futile gestures to change this reality
pomes ruiz report a
however the rapporteur goes even further in supporting the commission s recommendations
we have accordingly voted against the report
goebbels report a
the derogation of greece is abrogated with effect from  january  
on the surface greece does indeed meet the budgetary and monetary indicators required for emu
unfortunately these policies will not end when we accede to emu on the contrary they will be institutionalised consolidated and set in stone
we would start by pointing out that as far as we are concerned the matter is not technical it is highly political
the problem however is how we got here and what happens next
 nl i have voted in favour of the goebbels report and as such for greece s joining the single currency
i have voted with just as much conviction for the amendments to the pomes ruiz report
many meps have expressed doubts about in particular the sustainability of the convergence and stability policy of the member states
greece is welcome in euroland and all member states in the euro zone must respect the letter and spirit of the stability and growth pact
sellafield resolutions
mr president the vote on sellafield was a first for the european parliament
randzioplath report a
mr president i voted for the randzioplath report on the distortion of competition where public undertakings are concerned
this is a distortion of competition
let us take another sector state and private pensions
the report indicates the need for financial transparency between member states and undertakings
this was the reasoning behind our amendment which was unfortunately rejected
resolution on poor countries debt
the external debt of the developing countries poses a major challenge
the  poorest countries spend twice as much servicing their debt as they receive in aid
the proposal is very restrictive and is limited to the poorest highly indebted countries
it imposes far too many conditions on the countries requiring debt relief
i regret any conditions which are imposed particularly any link between debt relief and the application of structural adjustment measures
this is why i have abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution
but these same measures are given minimal application which has tragic consequences for the indebted countries but which benefits the creditors themselves in terms of export loans financial bodies and multinationals for example
first of all we must acknowledge that the third world debt is illegal
therefore the european union should promote an international bilateral and multilateral action cancelling the third world debt with no conditions attached
resolution on zimbabwe
the mugabe regime is authoritarian and corrupt
paasilinna report a
european union telecommunications directives ought to relate to the european union
in  the european union and the member states undertook to liberalise the telecommunication services sector
this undertaking led to the adoption of a series of directives
the commission has played a supervisory role in this which has resulted in a series of reports since may 
however major problems remain
a digital divide is apparent between both regions and citizens
the reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services
the exclusion of some citizens from the new information technology society cannot be tolerated
the preservation of universal service must therefore ensure the inclusive nature of this society
we must make certain that the regulations being prepared which have been submitted to this parliament adopt this approach
this measure must be thoroughly discussed with the national authorities in order to respond to the relevant objections
a major effort must be made in terms of harmonisation and simplification of rules
there is still a long way to go and we must not forget that the jobs created must be lasting and of a high quality
we only need to look at portugal s experience in this respect
we do not think this is the right way to proceed
we need a modern public telecommunications service which embraces technical and scientific progress
we need an affordable public service based on equal access and guaranteed users rights  a service that forms part of balanced development
we also want to see improvements in conditions of employment for the workforce in this sector
in this context the report illuminates a number of important aspects
i therefore abstained from voting on this report
alyssandrakis report a
i am not referring to pensioners and the elderly in general but in this case i am referring to my mother
i offered to teach her but she refused
this means that the elderly are not able to benefit from progress
alyssandrakis report a
mr president in relation to the second alyssandrakis report i must mention my daughter
that is what they told me when i arrived here this morning
i therefore put my name forward to become the first european union astronaut
maybe you should give your mother the spaceship and your daughter the telephone
the limits on communitarisation imposed by the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be kept in mind
the standardisation of rights concerning intangible assets has already proved its value in the case of trademark law and copyright
the logical conclusion is therefore to create a community patent
decision makers at national level will have to be sufficiently farsighted if this ambitious project is to succeed
the competitiveness of the entire european union must be taken into account when research contracts are being awarded
plooijvan gorsel report a
all this money should be managed by a single expenditure centre the european union
i am concerned because i would like to see more research in the field of science which aims to prolong human life
this is why the meps of the eea shall be voting against mrs plooijvan gorsel s report
on average the eu devotes just  of its gdp to research compared with  in the usa and  in japan
smetgroner report a
it also requires a subsequent evaluation of those measures above all so that they can be adapted in the event that they are not sufficiently effective
this is why the smetgroner report and the proposals contained in it are so opportune and correct i have therefore voted in favour of it
however i regret the fact that the amendment that i presented on behalf of the ppe has not been accepted
we also think that the  review process should in no way lead to a renegotiation of the commitments entered into in beijing
the report by mrs groner and mrs smet gives me the opportunity to look again at a questionable action platform
as well as containing a malthusian ideology the beijing action platform uses means of implementation which we condemn
such an approach ensures that the people concerned have a better understanding of these broad international texts
we have also discussed and voted on mrs sorensen s report which deals with trafficking in women
these two debates should make us stop and think about the real scope and aim of these major international platforms
 the british conservative members decided to abstain in our vote on this report
this should not be construed at all that we are not opposed to discrimination
we are opposed to discrimination we do believe in equality of treatment between men and women
we do not accept however that the imposition of legal quotas is the way to achieve equality of treatment
quite the reverse
we think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination
we believe that women the world over and especially here in europe are making a valuable and positive contribution to the democratic process
we are convinced that role will develop fully and effectively without progressive or artificial means 
for these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote

this makes men into hirsute and aggressive beings who are the source of all the world s problems
furthermore we do not believe that women can by nature be a factor of economic development
clearly they can contribute to this and we must give them the means to do so
however we believe that in the context of this debate the absolute priority must be to provide education
we also cannot accept the individualisation of human rights to be found in this report
a restrictive international instrument certainly cannot be based on false assumptions
being forced into parttime work is clearly a source of poverty which is why we oppose this
the wage gap between men and women of around  still remains
on this issue the report should have introduced coercive measures to eliminate this state of affairs
this would of course require a political will
it is our duty to support them
that concludes the explanations of vote
the sitting was suspended at  pm and resumed at  pm
equal treatment
mr president it was fifty years ago last week that robert schuman with his speech laid the foundation for the ecsc
meanwhile coal and steel have ceased being the cornerstones of the integration process
over the past six months it has become evident that values are increasingly at the centre of the debate
europe as a community of values
during the portuguese presidency there has been a political momentum within the council of which i as well as other meps would have liked to have made use
i would now like to move on to the commission s proposal
the commissioner has done justice to the wide range of areas across which discrimination can manifest itself
the directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination as well as the term harassment 
my report also calls for the inclusion of incitement to discrimination
i hope that this addition can be adopted by the commission
parliament has also looked very carefully into the areas to which this directive applies
i hope that i have got the wrong end of the stick here
these days asylum and migration policy falls within the scope of the first pillar the deliberate exclusion of this area could not therefore be justified
a muchdebated topic in this parliament is the burden of proof
every member state is by now familiar with this concept whereby both the defendant and plaintiff have a role to play
this arrangement works well and has caused few problems
at the same time i recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential
i hope therefore that the house in its wisdom will decide tomorrow to adhere as far as possible to the commission s original text
unfortunately statutory measures against racism are necessary
they provide victims with protection and a right to redress
but it is also important in the forming of attitudes
it makes it clear that europe will not stand for racism
it is this message which this parliament needs to broadcast
everyone is different everyone is equal
i note what you have said mr ribeiro e castro
i do not think it was strictly speaking a point of order but i have taken note of it
mr president i want to add my voice to those members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through parliament
this is a parliament with a proud record
since the s we have led on action and on initiatives to combat racism xenophobia and discrimination
we now have in the buitenweg report a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan
i want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the committee on legal affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism
we too believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism
groups and antiracist organisations in my region in the northwest of england are eagerly awaiting this legislation
racism is on the rise again
we all have our local examples
so vicious was this attack that merseyside police called for an urgent press conference
this has to stop
firstly i want to congratulate the commission on this text
it is a good text
many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it
they want this legislation quickly and they want it now
that is why it is important that we vote this afternoon
it is important legislation
in the context of what has happened in austria it becomes even more important
there are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text
we need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism
it is very important that we get it through today
that is the first point
when i read the report and hear the discussions i get a strong feeling of deja vu
all the points raised then together with the hesitation and conflicts have come up again now
the hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report
it is then up to the party which is indicted to prove that we are wrong
it is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect
the distribution of the burden of proof is an important point which should be looked into by a committee such as the one mentioned above
distribution of the burden of proof will affect their position
i consider this to be an important gesture also visavis the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats and this i very much appreciate
a directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation
this is after all the nature of the directive
in addition we do not need to include a number of bureaucratic procedures of how everything needs to be done step by step
we will not be voting in favour of this or rather we will be voting against this
but this does not affect the core of the report mr president which is what this is all about
naturally these too should be held free from discrimination based on race or ethnic origin
we must strike up a social dialogue where this type of issue can be discussed
this is what it is all about
we are gathered here people from different nations and of different origins and we are working together
i am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner
i am pleased however that we managed to stop them in their tracks
we all know that the portuguese presidency is determined to bring this debate in the council to a successful conclusion
this will not be easy
the majority of meps know very well why this directive is important
i know that the debate in the council is also a difficult one
to finish off i would like to highlight a number of my group s priorities in terms of content
firstly it is extremely important for the nondiscrimination directive to have a wide and efficient scope
this is taking it much too far
moreover my group also supports the reinforcement of and support for the operation of those independent monitoring bodies
i am convinced that the centre for equal opportunities in my own country will be encouraged in its activities by this directive
we women are already familiar with this procedure
this is why we will also support the commission s proposal and will not permit any amendments in this area
welcome
it is my great pleasure to welcome our colleagues from local government and i am delighted that you are so interested in our work
equal treatment continuation
i am delighted to have been able to work with mrs buitenweg
this proposed directive is a landmark for europe
i want to highlight a few aspects of the text
firstly the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism and amendments have strengthened that aspect
secondly the specific inclusion of housing health and other public authority functions including policing
thirdly the inclusion via amendments nos  and  of disguised race discrimination
fourthly the inclusion as has already been mentioned of incitement or pressure to discriminate  that is very important
i think that amendment no  is not well drafted
i am rather sorry that the socialist group insist on calling it a l of the burden of proof because that is slightly misleading
it applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law
the definition of a minimum european framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required
all these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead
however certain shortcomings must be highlighted
there are also two other problems which i must raise
the first is of a general nature
singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others
this is unacceptable
a second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly
the council must therefore make haste and propose a draft directive encompassing all types of discrimination
this is absolutely vital as the most excluded are those who suffer several types of discrimination
protecting them from just one type will only go partway towards helping them
the second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive
for example how do you define the jewish identity
discrimination against north african communities in europe is also twosided
it may even often be said that the fear of islam acts as a catalyst for racism towards these communities
dividing the fight against discrimination among a number of texts is dangerous for the overall coherence of the antidiscrimination mechanism and therefore weakens it
but first of all we have to do our work
i would like to point out that the amendments mentioned by baroness ludford are still not available in all languages this afternoon
mr posselt we are used to confusion reigning in this house but i will have this checked
how can we claim to be protecting from discrimination those to whom we refuse any citizenship
discrimination will only be effectively combated when governments stop using double talk
however this text is a step forward on which we must build
unfortunately it is not evident that that has happened
on some points the amendments involve precise improvements to the text in question
however in key areas the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything
reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right
secondly there is the issue of nationality
we portuguese can perhaps boast the richest mix of blood and ethnic origins in the course of history
i myself and my circle of friends have not the faintest idea of our ethnic background
but it is important not to confuse separate issues
in other words ethnicity is one issue and nationality is another
the other vital area is religion
we do not believe that the end justifies the means but that the means prefigure the end
finally we do not agree with the references to positive discrimination
mr president it is with mixed feelings that i am making my contribution to this debate
this is largely to do with the way in which the discussion of this report has been forced upon us against normal procedures
needless to say i subscribe to the importance of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin
the change in the burden of proof is just one example of this
parliament s amendment takes the commission s proposal one step further
the commission specifies that the principle of subsidiarity is still being enforced but i question that
the directive is said to have a supplementary function with regard to the political signal it sends out
it goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied
there is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society
however it is possible to overshoot the mark even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue
arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination
quite the opposite  it actually harms the cause
the precision of the impact assessment form annexed to the commission proposal is totally dependent on the use of the phrase without apparent difficulty 
the wording is as follows identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty 
twenty years on it is now coming true
we are here discussing this directive
i should like to comment on a number of amendments
you also propose to amend the definition of indirect discrimination and one of the speakers also mentioned this
after many years in application we have seen that these fears were unfounded and that there were no problems
i think therefore that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach
we understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction
and how difficult it will be to negotiate the directive with the member states where there are diametrically opposed approaches
i should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept
the reforms which we are presently endeavouring to implement within the commission have taken account of the entire framework of this directive
it is also becoming increasingly evident that cooperation within the eu is indispensable
it is with pleasure that i compliment mrs buitenweg on her report
it is an excellent report which deals with the equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin in general
i have another four points i would like to make mr president
this would be a gain in my view
finally i would like to say a few words on the already mentioned problem of sharing the burden of proof
the same system is now also being proposed with regard to this directive
as the commissioner said in practice this has never led to any difficulties in other spheres before
all the more reason to accept a swift implementation here
and on time
meps and ngos worked very hard to get article  into the treaty
i look forward to seeing further directives perhaps starting with disability
initially i was against racism being taken separately
i would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the action programme
i was persuaded of the urgency because of the current rise of racism across the eu
a number of members have cited individual cases today
we have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the eu
i am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today
may i turn specifically to some of the amendments
i am very well aware that some european jargon excludes people
this is the reason i wanted amendment no  on simple language to go in
amendment no  people have talked already about the burden of proof
this is working towards a shared burden of proof
amendment no  i am delighted that charities and nongovernmental organisations are going to be consulted
they are at the sharp end they know what they are talking about
mr president since the treaty of amsterdam and the tampere justice and home affairs summit things have really got moving in europe
it is very pleasing to see this
there was no antidiscrimination provision of this kind in the treaties before
the european institutions can now on the basis of article  take appropriate steps to fight certain kinds of discrimination
the european parliament has also made its own contribution
in general mrs buitenweg s  or so amendments make the commission proposal much more substantial
she has achieved a great deal
the proposal before us is the first implementation of article 
it concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people s skin or their ethnic origin
the commission is also attempting to build on experience gained in the member states
the reversal of the burden of proof will make the directive a very important instrument
the defendant will now have to provide convincing proof that there is no discrimination
the scope of the directive has also been widened with protection against discrimination being extended to associations and groups of persons
a large majority of the committee went along with the rapporteur and the vote today allows us to take that decision further in a consistent way
nevertheless a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal
mr president i too congratulate mrs buitenweg on her excellent work
this discrimination encourages them to withdraw into their identities and further reinforces their marginalisation
it is their families who are refused access to housing and healthcare as a result it has always been and still is very important to offer victims a protective legal framework
adopting the report and implementing the directive would send a strong political signal the european union could show in this way that it is concerned about the millions of people who live within its territory and that it is positively acting to reduce racial tensions
for all these reasons we must vote for this report
we know that the report and the directive have their limitations and will not solve all the problems
most countries already have legislation against racism and discrimination including in some of their constitutions
yet discriminatory practices are continuing
clearly what is often lacking is a real political will to effectively apply these texts
in france last year there were only  complaints and convictions for acts of discrimination
most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police
they are not investigated by the public prosecutors who consider that there are more important cases to be tried
ensuring equal rights is a state responsibility
the associations are currently leading the fight against discrimination
finally another problem still remains which is the differing application of the nationality code
currently a young person born in a member state of foreign parents is faced with two different situations
that apart i congratulate mrs buitenweg and warmly welcome this report
yes i asked mr sylla to slow down
but he is free to accept or reject my advice
however you are right the consequences are that what he is saying is not heard in the other languages
mr president i wish to make three points
it has been a long time coming
i myself was the rapporteur for the committee of inquiry into racism and xenophobia in  that reiterated that demand
i suppose in a way it was worth waiting
the last of these must be workable because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy
thirdly and finally i wish to warn my colleagues in the ppe group
yet a few clearly have darker motives
those who lie down with dogs get fleas
the international herald tribune says that we shall not succeed in obtaining that level of immigration and recruitment
we are used to coming out against racism because we want to combat intolerance and xenophobia
perhaps we must also combat these things for the sake of our own future
i support most of the amendments but on one point i am uneasy
i am afraid that this may be selfdefeating
there is a danger that what we believe to be an extension of the definition concerned may in actual fact be a restriction of it
the general interpretation is in fact that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality
i shall not therefore be voting for the present amendment
it contradicts what i properly consider to be the case
i would like to thank mrs buitenweg and mr howitt for the work that they have put into this which has been both a personal as well as a political commitment
as others have said this is an aspirational directive about the sort of europe we want to create
it is directly relevant for once to the lives of many people living within the european union
i welcome the directive
i am pleased council feels a sense of urgency about it
i assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what parliament is saying
we have to demand the highest standards of ourselves
it will not be easy to implement this directive and i am not referring to the votes
that will not be easy or painless
in the uk we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions
that cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions
that is why the amendments about training monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive
mr president ladies and gentlemen europe has become strong and we have learnt how to build bridges over the last  years
we should also all be concerned about integration about good neighbourliness
we should endeavour to provide incentives and to act as a model
i believe that in human society acting as a model is a particularly important characteristic
we are therefore the european country that has accepted most refugees per inhabitant
we were a kind of liferaft in europe and we still are today
we fight against extremism on both the left and the right as well as against violence
austria has the world s strictest laws against fascism and against nazism
we have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things
we are now talking about discrimination
first and foremost i am speaking on behalf of small and mediumsized enterprises
when i visit companies i often hear the complaint that there is too much bureaucracy and too many formalities
form filling is of course a very inefficient kind of work
it will encourage abuse
people will need to protect themselves against such abuse
it will be necessary to keep more evidence
i can see great dangers here and we must ensure that they are averted
this house should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as article 
posturing is easy
motivations are many and varied
my friend mr sylla and i are concerned about two important things
one is that we create a level playing field through article 
we have some  we can improve ours
mr president it was difficult to follow the previous speaker who speaks from the heart
i would also congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work
i am of course very much in favour of our arranging for the present directive to be implemented in the member states as quickly as possible
i would especially emphasise four factors which i think are particularly interesting about this directive
firstly we have obtained a broad scope of application and secondly the directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination including malice
at the same time a shared burden of proof has been proposed
it would be interesting if the commission could explain to us what the motives were for creating this hierarchy of discrimination
mr president i would like to thank mrs buitenweg and mr howitt for their excellent work and the commission for their proposals
it is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the commission s proposals on the whole of article 
the time is right to do so
i feel a heightened sense of urgency as we contemplate and embark upon the enlargement process
we are more than a trading block
i hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation effecting all minorities
the price if we do not is a europe falling far short of its true potential
that is why this directive and the article  package as a whole are so significant
it is not perfect
these current steps must be applauded but there is still a long way to go
applause
ultimately discrimination kills and it blights the souls of those who practice it and those who encourage it
we should therefore adopt this report without further delay
this directive forms part of a larger package which implements article  of the ec treaty
i can understand why the commission has decided to include the fight against racial discrimination in a separate draft directive
if anything these socalled more recent factors deserve more not less attention
it was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made
mr president we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms
however i do not believe extending eu competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause
new laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of europe
what we need is education time and confidence building in a spirit of cooperation between the various ethnic communities
the shift of the burden of proof as called for by this draft directive is both frightening and extreme
this is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice
of course we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks
criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the member states
this must remain the prerogative of the member states who will retain control of their own justice systems
the eu has no competence in this area whatsoever
the more the word racist is bandied about the more it will become meaningless devalued and ignored by the public at large
i call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures
the debate is closed
the vote will take place immediately following the urgencies
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
sierra leone
the first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by van den bos malmstrom and thors on behalf of the eldr group
b by maes lucas rod schorling and boumedienethiery on behalf of the vertsale group
b by sauquillo perez del arco and schori on behalf of the pse group
b by van hecke ferrer schwaiger and maijweggen on behalf of the ppede group
b by morgantini sjostedt brie and manisco on behalf of the guengl group
on the situation in sierra leone
mr president let us exercise honesty rather than hypocrisy
we are not prepared to make any sacrifices
the united states is paralysed by the somalia syndrome
the union hides behind washington s back
the united nations intervention has once again turned into a fiasco
only thanks to the united kingdom were we able to stop the rebels in their tracks and arrest their leader sankoh
more than anything we now need a watertight diamond boycott
i would call for at least exercising more honesty when we discuss africa
africa where the cruellest conflicts are taking place is also as far as peace is concerned a forgotten territory
the mandate of the united nations mission in sierra leone is by any reckoning insufficient to achieve its objectives
the united states and great britain have only sent forces to the united nations mission in order to guarantee the safety of the evacuation
the european union must therefore support all these types of measures within the framework of the cfsp
but even that was evidently not enough for the rebel leader sankoh he turned the disarmament pledge into a farce
murder mutilation abduction and rape simply continued as before
in any event the arms embargo must be supervised more effectively and perpetrators must be brought to justice
i will call for a ban on these precious stones which are stained with blood from thousands of innocent citizens in my own country belgium
mr president we are appalled at the present situation in sierra leone
we demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations
onesided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation
i have the feeling that economically speaking the united kingdom is acting in a neocolonial way and that in political and military terms it is now acting like a colonial power
quite the contrary it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation
it is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found
because of this we need deescalation in freetown not escalation
however our commitment must not end with this call
we must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country
we are celebrating the th anniversary of the schuman declaration
we stand here in moral indignation and are at the same time filled with a huge sense of powerlessness
we can condemn and we can make demands but what we need to do and can do as a parliament is to come up with new ideas
what do we now have to learn fifty years after  may  that is to say fifty years after the schuman plan
we need an equivalent plan for africa s resources just as we need a movement in opposition to the diamond trade
i feel that from a human point of view this is much more important than any amount of movements in opposition to the fur trade
mr president we must not forget that the ruf is a vicious and brutal grouping
we should congratulate the british government on taking effective action in a peacekeeping capacity
this is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the european union
that is a lesson we have to learn if we are to have a rapidreaction force within the european union
we should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future
however the sierra leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism
we are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the ruf for war purposes
but what are the economic interests behind the government s actions
but who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds
mr president i wish to begin by saying that the commission very much welcomes the capture in the early hours of the morning of  may of the rebel leader foday sankoh
we understand he was arrested by the sierra leonean police and that he remains in government custody
i am sure we all hope that sankoh will now accelerate the release of the remaining hostages there are apparently about  of them
we understand that has already commenced but there is a long way to go
that if anything is an understatement
we remain convinced that the lome agreement still offers the best chance for lasting peace in sierra leone
the commission together with member states is currently examining the regional dimension to the conflict with a view to formulating an appropriate regional response
the commission stresses the role to be played by regional organisations for example ecowas in the prevention of conflicts
in addition this funding has covered support to amputees  the all too many amputees in the country
excombatant children will again receive psychosocial support
the debate is closed
the vote will be taken at  pm
sri lanka
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
b by van den bos on behalf of the eldr group
b by titley and sakellariou on behalf of the pse group
b by van orden and deva on behalf of the ppede group
b by frahm morgantini and manisco on behalf of the guengl group
b by lambert mckenna and lagendijk on behalf of the vertsale group
on sri lanka
the resolution sends out a powerful message
the fighting has to stop
the parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last
we must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of sri lanka
beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued
above all parliament s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism
this is a scourge which affects us all
this is an attack on civilised society and the democratic institutions which we all value so highly
of course there are many other terrorist groups whose activities are sustained in a similar way
they cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity
this situation must change
i commend the resolution on sri lanka to this house
in this conflict far too many people have died
these are well documented by organisations such as amnesty and the us department of state in its  country report
young tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the tamil tigers and violent interrogation by the security services
it is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within sri lanka
thousands more have sought asylum and the whole population lives in fear of violence
the resolution is clear
those laws must be lifted before the elections in august
something has to change
we have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement
northern ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process but also the possibilities
this resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move
in  when sri lanka obtained independence it was one of the most prosperous countries in south asia
there are four million tamils in sri lanka and there are  million sinhalese
one million tamils live in the north the other three million live in peace in the south with the sinhalese
yet this pointless war also carries on to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition
the resolution states how many people he has killed
the ltte has to be stopped
mr president here we are again witnessing a conflict between two diametrically opposed parties
true this is the first time we have tackled this issue but we see similar cases every day
at this point a choice must be made between the two solutions
one of the members referred to the case of the state of singapore
singapore used to be part of malaysia but it is now an independent state
mr president i yield to no one in my desire for peace in sir lanka and in my condemnation of all violence
i know sri lanka i have been there
i can give you examples of what i have seen
i have seen tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops
that goes back longer than last may
it is salutary to recall that over   people have been killed during the course of this conflict  people in both ethnic groups
the commission shares the concerns of the european parliament regarding the latest developments in and around jaffna
that is fairly clear and understandable
the european commission will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid to populations affected by the conflict
i last visited sri lanka in the late s
alas   years later the violence continues
it has been a terrible blight on one of the most beautiful countries in the world with some of the most talented people
that is a reminder of what has been missed in sri lanka as a result of this violence
we all hope that it ends very soon
if we can contribute to the work being done by the norwegian and indian governments to help bring the parties together we would be happy to do so
the debate is closed
the vote will be taken at  pm

philippines
mr president commissioner the crisis in the philippines we are discussing is a tragedy
i represent one of the countries which has citizens as hostages there
there is nonetheless something to be learned from all tragic events
to that extent we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region
we should not put ourselves on a pedestal
we have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments
there can be no political justification for illtreating people as is happening there
it is not clear whether this is a case of organised crime or political demands but the island of jolo is now at the centre of the hostilities with this awful hostage taking
in these islands which are characterised by tropical luxuriance and unspeakable poverty the machine gunning of villages kidnappings ransom demands and torture are common currency
we also know that the violence has its roots in poverty
without the political will to end the situation the violence can only continue
equatorial guinea
mr president we are currently discussing an issue which parliament has dealt with on previous occasions
mr president the reason for this resolution has already been explained in equatorial guinea the political and social situation is still extremely serious
secondly the population endures harsh conditions of poverty
the government of president teodoro obiang has failed to comply with each and every promise of democratisation which it made to the international community
we are therefore concerned and we ask that efforts be made to observe how the elections are carried out
guinea is sinking further and further into underdevelopment
the union must exert pressure in this respect and not lower its guard or accept any more false promises from president obiang
we therefore believe that this house should follow that line
these elections may offer guinea the opportunity to start along the path to democracy
this is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of guinea
iran press code
the struggle in iran for reform and freedom is of great interest
they are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists
mr president bahar or the spring is the name of a new independent newspaper in the islamic republic of iran which we hope is still being published
this course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society
iranian conservative circles saw this trend as a deliberate attempt to secularise their own state  and with good reason
this was underlined by a painful defeat in the parliamentary elections only a few months ago
in order to turn the political tide the hard liners in tehran have not shrunk from using any means available to them
this hit the ultraconservatives during the parliamentary elections particularly hard
the present joint resolution supports the persecuted and the journalists in iran who are doomed to unemployment
the latter knew and know that they can count on the support of the large majority of the population
why
mr president ladies and gentlemen i am grateful for this opportunity to talk about iran again today
the reform process in iran is at risk
even before the newly elected reform parliament has been able to meet there has been a menacing intensification of the power struggle in iran
we are also concerned about the ban on all proreform newspapers and magazines published in iran
mr president we are currently witnessing massive attacks on the freedom of the press
last week mr putin s troops occupied the largest opposition publishing house in russia
yesterday the same thing happened in belgrade to the independent radio station there
i therefore fully support everything mrs ruhle has said
what is very much at issue here is that we should not allow those forces to be isolated which is what the regime is working towards
i am convinced that a dialogue with iran is in fact the only way to influence developments in that country
we must not leave the opposition unsupported by adopting measures that encourage isolation
burma
mr president it is an awkward situation this tenth anniversary of the elections of the nld in burma
awkward because the burmese junta was successful in obtaining international recognition
i refer naturally to burma joining the asean
in our opinion relations between the european union and asean should not suffer because of the problems within burma
these relations are too important for this
however we have to ascertain at the same time that our own sanctions were not that effective either
it may be opportune to consider whether we can take socalled intelligent sanctions against burma
after all sanctions should just focus on the one goal namely the reinstatement of democracy in burma
yesterday we saw the arrest of  members of the nld and the situation in burma has become untenable
we also need to criticise the french government for the fact that they are backing this
even the british government is more progressive when it comes to their policy on this
the british government has actually called on premier oil to withdraw from burma
the french government should follow the example of the british government
it is unacceptable that european multinational companies are investing in and backing up a system where largescale gross violations of human rights are taking place
mr president it is now ten years since burma witnessed a political drama
in the parliamentary elections the nld won most of the parliamentary seats
shortly after this the military once again seized power
mrs aung san suu kyi was imprisoned
parliament was dissolved and many mps were murdered imprisoned or driven out of the country
since then burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression
in the country itself entire population groups have been displaced in order to break up the minority groups
there is talk of forced labour
according to the financial times this week burma has more child soldiers than anywhere else in the world
burma can be compared with south africa and chile in the eighties
what action would we like the commission and council to take
we also ask you to take a hard economic line against burma
moreover eu citizens should be dissuaded by their governments from travelling to burma for their holidays
many of these new facilities have been built using forced labour
this is the core of our request
if it does then we are using double standards
mrs aung san suu kyi should at long last receive an effective response to her peaceful protest
football euro  and preventing hooliganism
most members will find this motion uncontentious
these i will tackle now because i believe these points are what people want to hear about
this stand like all the others will be full to capacity on  june
but surely common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively reexamined
i do hope that members will support this motion because this is something we can actually change for the better
mr president i hope there will be a great football match on  june between england and germany
most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe
but unfortunately that is not the view of everybody
the german police antihooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there
there is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there
the head of the belgian police federation has said that he is concerned
i do not believe however that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly
this is wrong for several reasons
our fellow member has spoken of regional pride
it is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries
are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving paddington station
mr president there are a number of advantages to this text
despite that is there still a risk
of course but then there is always a risk
when faced with such a phenomenon you can never say that nothing will happen
paragraph  as indicated by mr dehousse is incorrect
the belgian authorities have given authorisation for the charleroi stadium to be used
paragraph  which indicates that the king baudouin stadium in brussels might be used is wrong
no authority and no official has indicated this
we must therefore be reasonable and certainly not adopt texts like this
finally our fellow member has cited information which he was delighted to indicate was given to him by the bbc
what did mr keegan say  i am nearly finished mr president  during his visit to charleroi
he said that it is a suitable stadium for a highlevel match
so be sporting
however we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters
i welcome the dialogue under way now between the commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve
mr president we must take these issues of hooliganism seriously
we must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability
the motion is good in that it indicates that adequate safety measures must be taken
in this respect i believe there to have been a recent example in france which is very important
for years under the nazi banner french hooligans monopolised a stand at the parc des princes in paris
they took advantage of matches to vent their hatred chant nazi slogans and chase blacks and arabs on leaving the ground
thirdly the police forces of all participating countries must be encouraged to negotiate obstacles which would hinder extensive collaboration
fourthly we would like to call on all those involved  organisers players and supporters  to observe fair play
in my opinion zero tolerance is the only way to systematically tackle any infringement and efficiently penalise any breach
the content of the current resolution overlooks the causes of hooliganism whether or not consciously
it is clear that the initiators of the resolution are more concerned with slating the organisation of euro 
the liberals however refuse to play this game
mr president we are unable to support the submitted resolution
it is also an insult to  in this case  the belgian organisers of this game and the international authorities involved
in addition we continue to learn important lessons such as for example how we should really guide the fans
how can we better educate club managers and organisers of games
mr president hooligans have managed to spoil the fun of the real fans too often
it will be different at euro  as this will be a football party for everyone
the commission shares the honourable members concern for the health and safety of the hostages in jolo and basilan
we strongly condemn such terrorist actions
we were of course fully associated with the decision to send the eu high representative javier solana to the philippines
he received assurances from the government of the philippines that military force would not be used to liberate them
we are following events in mindanao and the neighbouring islands closely
i should wish to add one final point about the  hostages  seven of them are european union citizens
obviously we all hope for their early release
our thoughts are i am sure with their families
i hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered
moving on to equatorial guinea
we have been closely monitoring the human rights situation there for several years
we share the concerns of the european parliament about the local elections there
those concerns were reflected in the presidency declaration at the beginning of may
during a recent mission by the commission services the issues that parliament is addressing were raised directly with the president
an official request for an electoral monitoring mission was sent on  may by the equatorial guinea government to commissioner nielson
an answer containing detailed reasons for the refusal is being sent by the commission to president obiang
however we intend to involve ourselves in promoting the process of democratisation in equatorial guinea
on iran the commission fully shares parliament s concern over the lack of freedom of expression there
the iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues
the current trial of the  jews on charges of espionage is also very disturbing
i turn to burma
we deplore the continued violation of human rights by the burmese military regime
i just wish to make two additional points
at the same time a handbook was made available with examples of working methods to police forces
i would just like to add one point
i very much hope that euro  is a great success
the debate is closed
the vote will be taken at  pm
mr president on a point of order
i will be very brief but i rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most members here
on a number of occasions this week the members bar has had in it visitors from outside parliament and actually just members of the public
i know a number of members during the week have been unable to get any food
could we have some clarification from the quaestors so that we can have a members bar
we have a members bar in brussels
i hope we can have some clarification
thank you mr sturdy
we will refer that to the college of quaestors as you requested
the matter of football hooliganism was under the human rights matters
that debate has been concluded
so we have finished that whole section
i do not want lots of debates
we have a lot of voting to get through tonight
if that had been the case some members might have voted differently
we were going to discuss guatemala
i do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue
that was the rule under which this practice has been established
i agree with you that it should not become a precedent
let us move forward now to the vote
mr president on a point of order
i should like to move that we proceed to a vote straight away
we had the debate on this this morning we made our decision let us just get on with it
vote
mr president people are different yet of equal value
in our opinion human society should be based on solidarity human dignity and equality
everyone is entitled to this
there is also discrimination if the basic requirements of people are made unnecessarily scarce
people then start to think along the lines of if the others were not here there would be more for us
from a racist angle the question then simply is who can have those scarce provisions and who cannot
anyone belonging to a different group can be seen as an unwanted competitor on the job or housing market
in western europe employers and the police are still ruled by prejudice and a tendency to treat people unequally
everyone is entitled to protection from those seeking political and economic gain from discrimination
mr president i voted for the proposal for the race directive
today s pensioners and elderly people lived through the second world war they know what racism means
since sadly this is not the case at present europe is acting wisely in publicly making its position so clear

the proposal initially seemed to be well intentioned as it aimed to improve protection for victims of racism in the european union
this sows the seed for the famous american policy of positive discrimination which is nowadays much disputed even in the usa
and this is just the commission s text which is the most moderate
the european parliament report adds to this in all respects
this unusual procedure clearly shows that the issue is not cut and dried
unfortunately this statement which is solely intended to give the authors a clear conscience is completely false
this is why i abstained during the vote on the legislative resolution
it should be noted that these conventions are binding on the european union and the member states which have ratified them
this wording also contradicts the laws and constitutions of several eu member states
this article cannot be transposed into french law for example as the constitutional council would rightly be forced to oppose this
 i am voting in favour of the race directive for the following reasons
as a british asian woman i have experienced firsthand the damaging effects racism can have on people and communities
for example in my own region the west midlands we have recently seen some worrying instances of racist violence
the attack on the white partner of the worldclass black athlete ashia hansen is a sickening example
once the facts of the case are established it will fall to those accused of racism to prove their innocence
rightwing extremism is increasing not just in austria but throughout europe
minority groups must be given a greater stake in europe
the eu should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations
we need to connect eu institutions to all the communities of the union
europe must be inclusive not exclusive
we must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs
the race directive is a stand against racism and a major step towards stamping it out
according to article  of the treaty the european parliament is merely to be heard on this matter
we have nonetheless been unable to vote in favour of those amendments directly affecting matters which come within the sphere of the member states criminal law
these matters continue to be national concerns
but what about all the other protective considerations listed in article  of the treaty
we are concerned that by only proceeding on the basis of these two considerations in the present directive the eu will in practice create a hierarchy of possible grounds for discrimination
we would therefore especially draw attention to amendment no  concerning a new consideration which is absolutely crucial for ourselves
the portuguese presidency is to be congratulated for their readiness to put this matter on the council s agenda
however such initiatives are no longer enough
we must go further and legislate
the buitenweg report is timely as racism and antisemitism are still of concern in europe
is this the right moment to reiterate our vigilance with regard to certain parties now in power
with mr deprez and mr de clercq i tabled an amendment to the title of the directive
in the french version the commission s initial text uses the phrase sans distinction de race ou d origine ethnique 
we should like an assurance that this will be duly corrected
to conclude the buitenweg report is inspired by a proactive and progressive approach which i have supported
the risk of a resurgence of the neofascist and racist hydra requires close vigilance from us more so now than ever before
we must lead the way in this fight
that concludes the vote
trafficking in women continuation
the next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women
mr president commissioner i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the magnificent work she has carried out on such a serious problem
the different countries of the european union must harmonise their legislation in this respect and implement sufficient measures to help these victims
the trade in sex is increasing at an alarming rate
women and children are involved
mr president every year half a million women are tricked or forced into lives as sex slaves
few offenders are brought to court and still fewer prosecuted
the eu has so far exemplified the fact that words are not always translated into reality
a growing number of women are being smuggled in from the candidate states
there is a lack of legislation not only in terms of measures to combat the aforesaid mafia but also in terms of laws to protect the victims
we are voting today or hopefully tomorrow on an attempt to convert rhetoric and fine words into concrete measures
the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities is demanding that the member states provide women who give evidence with protection and refugee status
before the end of this year the governments of the member states will presumably have decided upon a new treaty
this report is very good
i am often sceptical about the very large demands for example with regard to the environment which are being made of the candidate states
this measure would not in fact require large resources and it is entirely feasible to implement it
mr president prevention is better than cure
this seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women
in the rapporteur s report it appears that the measures taken so far have been to little avail
if we really want to prevent trafficking in women we will need to adopt a different approach
we cannot put a stop to this trade by amending immigration and asylum policy and the legalisation of prostitution
and although i am generally in favour of good working conditions these too cannot halt the trafficking in women
it is not only heartless criminal organisations but also rich and not so rich customers who help perpetuate the slave labour of these women who have no other prospects
we cannot bridge this chasm between rich and poor with a few initiatives organised at community level
only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her very valuable report
i think i can assume that the sorensen report makes it abundantly clear that this is not the case
we back mrs sorensen s report  and i would like to congratulate her on her sterling work
all too often in many countries those women are criminalised whereas in fact they are the victims
what we are advocating is a legal residence status for those women so that they can be protected
patsy sorensen our rapporteur knows the topic of her report like the back of her hand
the body and the human person are not commodities
i would like to stress three points firstly trafficking and immigration
a closed border policy prompts immigrants to turn to criminal organisations in order to procure visas or enter the country concerned illegally
the member states must develop a more united responsible policy
thirdly the victims rights
i would like to finish by raising the question of clients
commissioner vitorino repeatedly stated the need to take into account the demand of this market that is the clients
but who are the clients
they could be our fathers our sons or ourselves
it is our duty to do our part to bring about a radical change in the mentality and culture of our society
this means promoting policies which support women
mrs sorensen s report goes beyond this perspective and gives absolute priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings
the stop and daphne programmes already represent a major contribution of the european union but we must not stop there
at national level refugee status must be granted to the victims of trafficking and they must be issued with residence permits
some countries  italy and belgium  assisted by ngos have already introduced some early measures
i take the opportunity of paying my respects to my predecessor mrs gradin who was the author of that communication
may i extend my congratulations to the honourable member mrs sorensen
her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work
we have proved that in the proposals that we put to the european council of tampere last october
i will therefore try to address a few of these key issues
as a starting point in this exercise we have here the february  instrument but it has become quite clear that it has its shortcomings
this means that the candidate countries will have to take it on board in the context of enlargement
this was one of the commission s suggestions in its second communication
this element must however be seen as a crucial complement to the first set of initiatives
as a matter of fact there is a real difficulty in convicting those who are responsible for trafficking
previous and future projects under the stop programme cover several points that are highlighted in mrs sorensen s report
in particular i would like to mention two of the priorities set for this year namely assistance to victims and prevention
the proposal will of course build on experience gained from the first programme
we also intend to offer the possibility of running multiannual projects which will improve the efficiency of the programmes
its scope as you know is to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women and children this includes trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of women
the commission has therefore opened daphne to the candidate countries and will do the same under the stop programme
for the future we are exploring the possibility of new campaigns targeting new areas and new countries
this is an issue that has a relevant role to play in the stability pact for the balkans
i want to thank mrs sorensen for her knowledge her expertise and her contribution to this common fight
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  am
readmission of third country nationals
it is linked to respect for human rights and to the economic social political and cultural conditions in the person s country of origin
this is a sensitive issue which calls for diplomatic collaboration
as far as the content of the finnish initiative is concerned there is no explanatory statement attached to the draft regulation
the initiative does not show any strategic vision
the regulation aims to determine which member state is obliged to readmit a third country national in order to implement the agreement in question
this provision seems to empower member states to take more severe decisions outside the scope of the proposed regulation
the proposal is perhaps a way of exercising indirect pressure for the borders of the european union to be fortified
in other words the proposal allows entry to the territory of a member state to be proven on the basis of hypothetical evidence
the way in which the data required to identify persons to be readmitted is determined is open to every kind of abuse
however the basic problem appears to be that no strategy or european policy has been devised on immigration
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would first like to thank mrs karamanou for cooperating in such a straightforward and excellent way
we only differed on a formal detail
on behalf of the committee on legal affairs we are also requesting that this initiative of the republic of finland should be withdrawn
i am certain that it was very well intended but it has not been thought through sufficiently
legally speaking it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations
i would like to add a few important points
an initiative of this kind should not mean that people can just be shipped back and forth within our territory
this is bordering on blackmail
my view of the finnish initiative is much less critical than theirs
apart from that i agree with many of the criticisms that have been made
i also agree with one which has been made implicitly but which has not been stated directly
this is what we have done in the case of the finnish initiative at least in the ppe group
why not
what we need now given the developments since tampere is a more global vision
all these types of bilateral agreement that are required are being negotiated
mr president i would first like to thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson for their report and opinion
i would also like to say on behalf of my group that we fully support the proposal to refer this initiative back
we have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports
what these proposals have had in common has been a failure to fit in with a coherent set of measures
something else they had in common was that they either conflicted with existing legal instruments or duplicated them
this also applies to the initiative before us today which the portuguese presidency is no longer treating as a priority
this does not seem to fit in with the joint action concerning a uniform format for residence permits
the member states should take the initiative here and act in compliance with the eu format in their own administrative area
i would thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson of the opinion for the frank direct and sincere words they have written about finland s initiative
furthermore the report states that there is a lack of strategic vision something which the rapporteur also said
it is all too reminiscent of austria s initiative on that famous first day of austria s presidency
i would point out that of all the members of the committees only two supported this initiative
i regret that the council s and parliament s time has been used in this way
i would emphasise that i am speaking as a finn and as a representative of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party
this idea is interesting for three reasons
the committee on citizens freedoms and rights totally rejects this finnish initiative however and in so doing shows a tendency to exaggerate
this reasoning is of course diametrically opposed to ours
mr president the commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report
i can assure you that the commission thinks that we should not start with this question of readmission
nevertheless for the time being it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details
that concludes the debate
the vote will be taken tomorrow at  am
the sitting was closed at  pm
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
are there any comments
this will obviously be corrected
unfortunately we will then have to wait for the result of these checks
i would therefore advise you to contact mr poos so that he can keep you informed of the situation
madam president i rise on the same point of order as my colleague mr sturdy
it imposes standards on beef in britain and cheese in france and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct
i am perfectly prepared in an extreme situation to die for my country and my family
i am not prepared to die from legionnaire s disease because i have to sit in strasbourg in june
therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it
this is why ladies and gentlemen we are taking every necessary precaution at all parliament s places of work
firstly could the same checks be carried out for parliament in brussels
the checks will therefore be carried out at all parliament s places of work but mr poos will be in a much better position to answer you than myself
madam president thank you for giving me the floor
i would like to inform and at the same time reassure the members who have just spoken on this important and serious matter
i should like to point out to them that the college of quaestors has acted in accordance with the precautionary principle
this check has therefore been carried out and as you know it proved negative on two points
we took the necessary steps immediately namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed
we are quite certain that asbestos was not used to construct the building
there is therefore no cause for alarm at present
we shall wait for the results of these checks and we shall take the necessary steps in accordance with the precautionary principle
it is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee s opinion reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion
secondly the minutes then state that mrs palacio vallelersundi confirmed that the letter faithfully reflected the committee s position 
in this way the two half truths could be turned into two complete truths
if they appear to be necessary the changes will indeed be made
i understand that the staff asked for an air quality check before this building was opened
i asked for an air quality check in january
why has it taken so long to get that air quality check
usually in a lot of countries if legionella bacteria is found in any part of a building that building is closed
are there any other comments on the minutes
there are no further comments
the minutes were approved
vote
madam president i rise under rule  so that i might question whether a quorum exists for this vote
 pt madam president i would like to speak in reaction to the blatant hypocrisy of the request that has just been made
during yesterday s vote on the buitenweg report we witnessed some very serious goingson in this parliament
that is all i wished to say
i should like the position of this house to be made very clear
according to the agenda the vote should have taken place today since the amendments were not put to the house in time yesterday
i appealed to the house to act fairly
i would urge the members dealing with this matter to declare a moratorium
we are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of fridays
of course the best way to do this would have been by voting on this important report today
however i believe mrs buitenweg cannot attend today s sitting
in any event we must nevertheless enhance the status of fridays
our group is in the process of taking appropriate precautionary action
i would urge you to let us work fairly and to stop deliberately disrupting our work
mr duff yesterday a vote was taken in the house on the buitenweg report as a result of which the karamanou and sorensen reports have to be put to the vote this morning
in this respect mr duff s request might have been overlooked among the large number of requests made
he has not been given any information which explains why he has made this request now
madam president the issue of requests for the quorum to be tested does not have anything to do with whether we work in strasbourg rather than in brussels
i do not feel that it is right to vote in favour of working on fridays and then be absent
i myself have requested that the quorum be checked many many times and on most of those occasions the quorum was not present
we moved our two topics so that mrs buitenweg s report could be discussed and voted on yesterday
mrs sorensen s and mrs karamanou s reports were therefore moved to yesterday evening to be debated and were to be voted on today
i think it is odd to say the least that our colleagues should behave in this way
it is an extremely serious document which mrs sorensen has written and which we shall be voting on today
madam president i just wanted to correct what mr posselt said
he said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on mrs buitenweg s report
the same thing will happen today with the fight against trafficking in women
pictures of poor girls living in districts that are unfit for habitation will be shown and it will be broadcast that not enough members were present in parliament to discuss the matter
so please i beg you to withdraw your request to establish the quorum and let us take a vote
mr duff do you uphold your request
we shall then see if  members join you
madam president should these reports be serious then they certainly deserve a quorum
what i will do is to press my point of order
very well so are there  members to support this request
 members rose the request is therefore withdrawn
we shall now proceed to the vote first we shall examine the text of the initiative from the republic of finland
the commission proposes that the initiative be rejected
madam president i think you are mistaken as the voting list is different
if we want to reject finland s initiative we must vote against it
that is primarily what we are voting on
so whoever votes in favour votes for the finnish proposal which was rejected by committee
madam president this is a very complicated process as mrs karamanou has already explained
i would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again
the present text should therefore be rejected and the council invited in the legislative resolution to submit a new text
i would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out
it gives us the chance to obtain a new text
indeed it is quite complicated
you would therefore like me to put the draft initiative from the republic of finland to the vote straight away
parliament rejected the proposal which was referred back to committee parliament adopted the legislative resolution
before the start of the vote

 members rose
president
the request is withdrawn
relating to amendment no 
madam president with regard to this amendment there is a linguistic problem
the french version contains the word delit  whereas this is written as crime in the english version
as you know madam president this does not have the same meaning in french
the amendment seeks to correct this
i am not the one who tabled the amendment but it does seem to me that this is the point of it
i wanted to point this out
relating to amendment no 
i endorse this amendment
you are therefore proposing an oral amendment to replace the words the churches and religious organisations with humanitarian organisations 
madam president i am not quite clear as to whether the words church organisations should appear in the text
if not i should like us to return to the original wording
you madam president said one thing and mrs sorensen another
would you be so kind as to repeat what the oral amendment should really consist of
i apologise for the lack of clarity
and so the churches and religious organisations is to be replaced by humanitarian organisations  because that is a much broader concept
madam president it was with great pleasure that i voted for the sorensen report
i fully approve the contents of the report but sadly i feel that it fails to get to the root of the issue
the motion for a resolution states that   people victims of trafficking in women enter europe every year
out of the   words in this report a mere handful are dedicated to the truth
 fr once again we are confronted with one of the most sordid aspects of contemporary society trafficking in human beings
and once again parliament responds to this by using an incoherent form of language whose repetition is discouraging
i will be told in reply that prostitution has always existed and that we should instead try to limit the damage it does
the libertarian decriminalisation measures have proved to be inefficient and dangerous no matter what the field
the unspeakable excesses of some people are often a sign of some distress which must also be put right
 fr the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities proposes a large number of ambitious legal measures in the sorensen report
it is essential that an ambitious development aid policy is implemented beforehand
nonnafo vessels
they will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future
as a result the european union must strengthen its presence in such regional organisations in those that already exist and in those that may be created in the future
nafo is an exception and has perhaps become the best attended most regulated and most monitored organisation of them all
nafo has served as a model in many cases
to be quite frank the owners of these vessels are stealing fish
they deliberately refuse to join nafo of which the european union is a member
they think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so
we have known for a long time what kind of problems the fishing industry as a whole has to contend with
this concerns everyone the international community individual countries and the european union
nafo is therefore more important than you would think for everyone and not just for the european union
the consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous particularly for cod and redfish two highly valued sources of food
in the final analysis every one of them always took whatever was still left and this could no longer be replaced at the end
as a member of nafo and with a large number of member states of its own the eu fulfils the requirements for this
a final word on this interesting term international law 
eu law also has its origins in international law
regional fishing organisations have played an increasingly important role over recent years in the management of resources
in this respect we the socialists would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility
the lack of ownership of the seas and the principle that the sea belongs to no one sprang from such ideas
in this way such countries would play a part in creating regulatory measures and would share responsibility for managing resources
people who idolise the market should note from this that neither fish nor people gain anything from their hypotheses
our fleet the community fleet does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet as a fleet without nationality nor as an intruding fleet
i would very much like to support this report
the reality of the situation is that vessels from noncontracting parties usually means vessels flying flags of convenience or flags obtained from countries which have open registers
these are countries which will allow shipowners the right to fly their flag if they pay the country a fee
they can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it
all the shipowner has to do is pay a bit of money to the country to get the flag which will allow him to fish with impunity
this really has to stop
many of these vessels have been active in the nafo area but that is not the only place where they operate
very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the atlantic where the regional organisation is icat
icat really does mean business and other people should follow suit
organisations like icat and nafo cannot solve the problem on their own
the responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously
many shipowners like to use flags of convenience for it lets them get away with just about anything
there is no way of enforcing the law
this is why it is so popular
the eu is among the worst in this sense
by far the worst of course and not surprising is spain with  vessels but of course they are not alone
each country tends to have their preferred flag use
for instance the french vessels tend to use flags of reunion st vincent and the seychelles
for greece it is cyprus and panama
the dutch use belize and st vincent and  vessels of course from my own country are flagged in belize as well
the preferred british countries are panama and belize
the only place which has more of these flags of convenience is taiwan with  which just beats spain into first place
the council refused
it wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules and that is not acceptable
at least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public s attention
the european union has to take responsibility on this issue
the european union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives
currently not all community ports are aware that directly or indirectly they are often providing cover for illegal activity
we can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it
the whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue
it does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the european union
in spite of these efforts something like  of all the major stocks are still overexploited and continue to diminish
we are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products
stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it
there is also the whole question of our obligation to protect this resource that belongs to mankind
there would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation
in respect of the proposed amendments i should stress the following
amendment no  does not seem to be necessary
amendment no  is relevant and will be taken on board
amendment no  is not acceptable to the commission
there is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels
if it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels there is no need to regulate
such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks which is certainly not acceptable
the debate is closed
i have been up in my room just now and it is little surprising that fridays are so devalued
the television technicians have gone home so the television pictures are of the assembly and no longer of the original speakers
the staff are apparently running for the exits from  am on friday mornings so it is hardly surprising that fridays are being devalued
i would ask you to check that the whole service of parliament is available so long as the house is sitting
i will pass on your comments to the bureau but as regards the tv system we have considered this question before
i do not wish to embark on a discussion of this issue now but you can rest assured i will pass on your remarks to the bureau
the debate is closed
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the legislative resolution explanation of vote
as ms mckenna rightly said the use of flags of convenience makes it possible to flout all the regulations
we will be staffing ships with sailors who do not know how to swim next
protection of juveniles of marine organisms
i hope that such unanimity leads them to reconsider their position on these two amendments that you said you would not adopt
as a result alongside the commission we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources
in the case we are currently dealing with we are discussing the fifth amendment which will enable the commission to include various new measures that in our opinion are fully justified
the commission s proposed revisions and additions to annex xii appear to be reasonable
this compromise of course has already been agreed with the member states as being more appropriate
we also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from  to  millimetres which has been widely called for by the sector is a very positive step
to sum up it is essential that this regulation is kept up to date and that it is based on the best available scientific recommendations
this will not be the last amendment made given that there will be a continuing need to adapt to specific conditions and to scientific reports that emerge in the future
mr president commissioner as you can see we are dealing thoroughly with the conservation of the fish population
no we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute
who as a child has ever taken a carpetshell venerupis polastra in his arms as he would a soft toy
we certainly have a heart for children but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving
we are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them
we must protect the periphyton of marine organisms now in order to preserve all species
the regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one
in fact it is being amended again today for the fifth time
in view of the developing populations however it must be amended time and time again in accordance with the requirements at a particular moment in time
in the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice
we do not have any objections to the amendments which the commission is proposing right down to the last detail
they represent the latest technical and scientific developments
ultimately parliament has no interest in branding the commission as its general scapegoat
on the contrary i would like to use this report to show that things can also be done differently
the committee on fisheries is particularly benefiting from positive cooperation with the commission and its services
this cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations
who apart from the commission should monitor them and protect this natural resource
it is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible
quantity instead of quality
these measures are a step in the right direction
this is a report of a technical nature which is of no interest whatsoever to the majority of meps
ladies and gentleman this is a matter of  millimetres of carpetshell
in galicia shellfish gathering on foot  and this is how carpetshells are collected  is only done by women
it would take a long and complicated explanation to say why
the truth is that  of naturally produced carpetshells fall short of the current size requirement
in places where molluscs are most abundant  and i am thinking of the ferrol and arosa estuaries  the size of carpetshells does not exceed  or  millimetres
carpetshells measuring  millimetres are neither produced sold nor consumed simply because there are none
but for a regulation to fulfil its purpose it must be adapted to real conditions
but if need be we will be here to amend it once again
it stands to reason that such measures and arrangements should be modified in the light of new needs and knowledge
as a matter of form i would point out that denmark has agreed to this technical measure for a limited period

i welcome the commission s updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles
the low breeding rate of the kittiwake that mr busk referred to is of particular concern
surely we must question the effectiveness of magps as a conservation measure
the commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced
i call for a more thorough investigation by the commission into this
how many would be decommissioned
how many were scrapped
how many were sunk and so on
how many were simply transferred to another flag
how many vessels continue to fish either here in the community or elsewhere under what is in many cases a flag of convenience
they can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea
i hope that the commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets
in scotland the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas
i should like to thank the commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this house as well as from the council which were along the same lines
evidently these figures also highlight the high socioeconomic dependency of some community regions on such activity
it is on the last proposal that i primarily wish to speak
this closed area is the one proposed by the commission in december as part of the annual tac regulation and adopted by the council
these measures have i understand already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved
i therefore hope the council will be able after this debate to reach a speedy agreement
it is important for the conservation of sea birds
it is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area
mr president this is an important subject
it is highly technical and not easily understood by the public
a gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us
we can improve our resources
we are not selfsufficient in fish in the union only  selfsufficient
this is highly technical
there is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it
people complain about the multiannual guidance programme and say it is not working
surely a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available
the same applies to trains or trucks
surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that
those reports spread over from scotland to ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed
there is no need for it
we have one programme broadcast in ireland that deals with the sea
it is called seascapes
mr mccartin appeared with his last remarks to be accusing honourable members of this house of misleading the public
i hope that was not true
mr mccartin is far too polite to make any such accusation
i am very happy to inform honourable members that the commission can agree to the amendments that have been put forward
that concludes the debate
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the legislative resolution explanation of vote
mr president as representative of the pensioners party i voted for the varela report
i would like to thank the house for its patience in listening to my explanations of votes
you are right the members bar is only for the use of members
we will ensure that is enforced
this matter has already been drawn to the attention of the quaestors
insurance
since i am often here on fridays anyway i personally do not find this at all difficult
the subject is exemption regulations which are in force for the european insurance industry
the general aim of competition law is to ensure that there is competition in the european internal market
this serves consumers promotes technical progress and prevents monopolies and agreements
therefore the rules on this are strict
over the past few years the commission on all these issues has repeatedly shown that it takes the provisions of the treaties very seriously
we will deal with the first of these areas today
the general prohibition of cartel agreements is lifted under certain conditions these are the exemption regulations
a regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since  and expires in 
the commission is required to submit a situation report every six years the present report is available
to date agreements on claims settlement and registers of aggravated risks have not been included
whether this is correct or not is doubtful
this concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination
with this in mind i would urge you to give your assent thank you very much
the commission says in its report that it is disappointed that the insurance industry has not taken up as much of that as it might have done
a brief word of background about the regulation in question is perhaps in order
most of these notifications concerned insurance pools
the current regulation expires on  march  and a new regulation will be necessary
the future regulation should build on these strengths and remedy any weaknesses in the existing one
it does not however contain precise proposals for the future regulation
these will only be decided upon after the end of the consultation process
considerable account will be taken of parliament s resolution in this process
other interested parties including professional insurance bodies and consumer organisations will also be consulted
this hearing responds in part to the call in the draft resolution for an informative debate on the regulation
it is clear that the area in which most improvement to the regulation is needed is that of pools
significant change will be necessary here but key questions exist in all the other areas
it takes good note of the fact that the draft opinion recommends the inclusion of agreements and on claims settlement
that concludes the debate
we shall now proceed to the vote
parliament adopted the resolution explanation of vote
both the public and ourselves are obviously pleased with the simplifications he has explained so clearly
i would like for this to be the case in other areas as well
and these centralists are also of course setting their sights on luxembourg  as a byproduct so to speak  for parliament s secretariat
certainly i must also say that this does not always make things easy for france to defend strasbourg as a parliamentary seat
one of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning
their bus was stopped by the french police under the pretext that the driver would not have a french driving licence
this particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years
what is going on here then
i must say that these visitors wonder naturally whether this is what europe is all about
moreover the french police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet
the visitors had to pool their french francs together to pay the horrendous frf   fine
this cannot be right mr president
i will of course check 
the president cut the speaker off
i am afraid i must cut you off mrs lulling
explanations of vote must refer to the subject of the debate
an older man who was about  added i only received eur   
another man who was about  years old said i suffered the same accident with the same results and i was given eur   
there you have it insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless
but i say that the elderly are worth more
i therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice
mr president i just wanted to ask one question
i did not notice mrs buitenweg this morning and i would like to apologise to her for that
i just wanted to ask whether mrs van der laan is here or have i missed her as well
i will take that as an interesting intervention
adjournment of the session
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament
the sitting closed at  am
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday  may 
tribute
we are very sad to hear of the death of mrs adelaide aglietta on  may  in rome
we all remember that throughout her intense political activity mrs aglietta was the political secretary of the italian radical party
she was copresident of the group of the greens between  and 
she was tireless in leading a number of campaigns particularly those promoting a federal europe and human rights
mrs adelaide aglietta was a very courageous woman
in the first place she had the courage of her convictions and argued passionately in favour of them but always with respect for the other party
the house rose and observed a minute s silence
statement by the president
i also assured the governments concerned of our utmost support in their fight against terrorism
the house rose and observed a minute s silence
we should like to show our solidarity with the family and friends of the deceased
once again political confrontation shows its most dreadful aspect
the leaders of sinn fein have never condemned the ira s violence
we in euskal herritarrok will stick to our commitment to work together with all those eager to find a democratic solution to the ongoing conflict in the basque country
on the other hand i believe that the words of the mep from euskal herritarrok are a disgrace
the mep in question has no right to class himself alongside mandela
nelson mandela deserves a different kind of respect
we heard mandela in the european parliament he fought against violence and represented the legitimate interests of his people
the legitimate interests of the basque people are represented by the people who have been democratically elected
words are insufficient when it comes to condemning not only the murderers but also those who give them political support
madam president you will be very welcome in the basque country
mr gorostiaga represents nobody but that minority which showing a complete disregard for the best european democratic traditions tramples upon fundamental rights
madam president i would like to thank you for your words of condemnation and condolence
of course we also very much welcome the fact that you are prepared to visit the basque country
madam president murder and shootings in the back provide no solution for the problems of the basque country
we have constantly rejected the use of violence in order to achieve political objectives
i must also say that i regret having to take the floor in these circumstances following this very recent act of violence
i believe that it is also fair to recognise the contribution the action and activity of the basque government
i would like secondly to make a call  an idealistic one perhaps  for peace and dialogue in that autonomous region
lastly i think it is very positive and opportune that the president of this parliament has announced this visit to the basque country
madam president you have already mentioned the murder in athens of the military attache to the british embassy stephen saunders
i should like to express my deepest condolences to stephen saunders wife and children whom we have seen on television
we cannot deny that a terrorist phenomenon has been a thorn in greece s side for many years
madam president i carefully read your statement in response to the speech by the french minister for home affairs
madam president we are indebted to mr leinen for reminding us about this incident
i would like you to know that you have our full and unequivocal support and that we owe you a debt of gratitude
incidentally we should refrain from entering into debate on this issue at present
madam president the final draft agenda is based on a partsession starting on tuesday  june
later on however it was announced that the members could sign the attendance register between  pm and  pm
it now looks as if we will need to be financially reimbursed for cancelling a working day
the electorate expect us to extend their democratic rights not to act in our own selfinterest
mr meijer i think that you have not got the information quite right
madam president i should like to say that this is a very great day for the danes
we too have now been successful in obtaining television in our own language here in strasbourg
i just want to say mary you are fantastic
a small country was successfully taken into account even if it did take a hell of a long time for this to happen
thank you mr blak
we shall pass your satisfaction and thanks on to mrs banotti
madam president on a point of order
i will ensure that mrs banotti gets that information
i will also be pressuring her to have irish television here too
i rise on a slightly more serious matter although of course i welcome the extension of all the media to our proceedings
madam president you will be aware that since we met here last the northern ireland assembly has been reconstituted
could i through you on our behalf request that our sincere good wishes be sent to all concerned and all parties
let us hope that we are on the road to something extremely successful in the north of ireland
i can see that the house approves of your proposal and i shall gladly do so mrs doyle
madam president just now you had to announce some extremely sad news
the european parliament is best placed to know that refusing to engage in dialogue is not the way to solve problems
it ought to be read and discussed among the members before it is signed
i have two criticisms of the framework agreement it does not solve those problems typically faced by meps
it is a humiliating situation when students are sent documents to which we ourselves do not have access
we are then asked by journalists if we can comment on this but we do not even have access to the document
i have just one more sentence
the president cut the speaker off
you have made a mistake in this case
the groups will naturally have adequate time to examine this document
the travel document which i used was the pass issued to all meps by the european parliament
thank you i shall take note of your comments
we shall look into what we can do to proceed as you suggest
madam president i should like to draw members attention to a very disturbing recent report by amnesty international
the report in question is the report on the war in kosovo
amnesty international has found that nato was in breach of many international laws as regards human rights
this is not acceptable
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the sitting of friday  may have been distributed
are there any comments
that is all i wished to say
i should like the position of this house to be made very clear 
thank you mr medina ortega
we shall check all this and correct the minutes if necessary
are there any other comments on the minutes
there are no further comments
the minutes were approved
agenda
who wishes to speak to propose this
madam president naturally we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo
you will understand that we are keen to keep this text
we hope that these countries will retain their political stability but unfortunately the situation over there is taking a turn for the worse
we have always stressed prevention
this is why i would like to call on the meps to continue caring about kosovo and serbia
while we were there we promised that we would do our best to adopt a motion of this kind this week
i urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution
we must bring pressure to bear on serbia and also on the albanians in kosovo so as to make them put things to rights
we can only do this using the modest means at our disposal namely a motion for a resolution
mr corrie i am quite happy to give you the floor but i should like to know whether you are speaking for or against the proposal
we are not here to start a debate
we followed the efforts undertaken by yourself and by mrs kinnock and we supported you in your endeavours
we were behind you all the way and we were delighted with the successful outcome achieved
let me make that point
parliament rejected the proposal
still on the subject of the topical and urgent debate i have received another request on venezuela
this is from the group of the party of european socialists to replace the item on venezuela with a new item on the coup d etat in paraguay 
madam president there are two reasons as to why we are not debating the venezuela issue
firstly there is the respect we have for our own rules of procedure
we are no longer in earnest about these debates on topical and urgent subjects of major importance nor is our attitude to be taken seriously
parliament approved the proposal
the order of business was adopted thus amended
then another proposal for a temporary committee of inquiry was tabled by our fellow member mr baron crespo
in short no such inquiry is possible
article  of the treaty clearly specifies that potentially this is parliament s responsibility
i wish to look into the matter in depth rather than adopt a position in haste
nonetheless i wish at this stage to reserve judgement on the admissibility of this amendment
even if i had worked on the matter solidly since  last night i think this would not have been nearly enough
in its meeting of  april the conference of presidents decided by a majority to create a temporary committee
according to the rules of procedure that is a different option to the committee of inquiry
i requested a report from the legal service which was received a week ago
the issue was included in the agenda of last week s conference of presidents
since the priority was to deal with other issues it could not be discussed
i understand that the final agreement reached was that we are going to discuss this issue at the conference of presidents
there is an obvious gap in the rules of procedure in this respect
i think the house must decide
the temporary committee of inquiry is a different problem since this is not in response to a request by  members of parliament
mr lannoye i have taken note of your comments and those of mr baron crespo
request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of mr brie
the legal affairs committee recommends to the house that we decide not to waive immunity in this case
it would be helpful if i say a few brief words about the grounds for our recommendations
this was repeated on other occasions
our recommendation is that we should not waive immunity
this is a case of the conduct of political activity and the expression of political opinion
the tenor of decisions of parliament in such cases has always been that immunity is not waived
this is not a matter of a benefit conferred on individual members as politicians
it is a matter of sustaining the conditions of a democratic assembly with free open and frank public debate
i have great pleasure in proposing to the house the report of the legal affairs committee
as mr maccormick has pointed out there have been cases where parliament has decided to waive immunity
i therefore agree with mr maccormick s proposal not to waive mr brie s immunity
as long as these rules exist however they must apply equally to everyone
what is more his crime really only has to do with the administrative rules in the police regulation and of his not having sought and obtained prior permission in accordance with these
this case is concerned only with a purely administrative violation
i understand that the same view has been expressed by members of different parties in germany
i therefore think that the matter is quite clear
on behalf of my group i would therefore express support for the draft decisions tabled by the rapporteur
request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of mr kronberger
the situation in the case of mr kronberger is completely different from the last situation we dealt with
in this case we are dealing with a mere traffic offence which has nothing to do with politics
mr kronberger was returning from his parliamentary work he turned left and caused an accident which injured two people
there is no political element no element of fumus persecutionis
mr kronberger himself accepts the waiver of his immunity and has no objection whatsoever
that concludes the debate
the vote will take place at  pm
manufacture presentation and sale of tobacco products
tobacco is a natural stimulant
you are supposed to enjoy it and politicians should not spoil this enjoyment
but mr president this is not how it is of course
needless to say the element of freedom of choice and personal responsibility should be retained
this is our business
and rightly so
with a directive of this kind the health aspects will inevitably be the focus of attention
i however do not share this doubt at all
if it had been a public health directive then other measures would have been proposed
we only need to look at the british and swedish examples to see that this policy works
this draft directive has far too little in common with the one currently under discussion in luxembourg to warrant a fair comparison
however we need to harmonise the internal market for tobacco products as a matter of urgency
at the moment we are entangled in national rules which leads to barriers to trade and legal inequality among consumers
harmonisation therefore will benefit industry and public health
i would have liked to propose a list of this kind myself but i believe that at the moment there is too much uncertainty surrounding such a list to warrant such a proposal
but the proposals made by the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection could mean that such a list could be a reality as early as 
we want to provide consumers with free choice based on more extensive information
the best means of communication is the packet itself
it has transpired that the current warnings which cover  of the front and back of the packet are completely ineffective and insultingly simplistic
first and foremost the information is misleading
the terms light  ultra light  lowtar and such like are incorrect
this terminology should be withdrawn
but in addition to this we need more useful information and this is what smokers want too
they know that smoking is not good for you but they know precious little else
i have tabled an amendment that tidies up the proposals made by the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection in this respect
the message on the packet should take up more space and should ideally be illustrated
how much space you may ask
well enough space
according to the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection it should take up  or 
i suggested  or  in a proposal which i resubmitted via my group
but in any case messages should not take up less than  of space on the packets which is the proportion currently specified in poland
this is why in my opinion the  suggested by the european commission is insufficient although it is a huge step forward
finally i would like to thank the delegates for their remarkable cooperation and i am also grateful to the european commission and the presidentinoffice of the council
this is bound to result in better policy
similarly the dialogue with the health organisations and industry has been a positive step
this parliament has freedom of choice too and can now use it
a choice between tinkering at the edges or taking forceful measures
i call on parliament to display the courage it takes to go far because this will be to everyone s benefit
mr president smoking is bad for the health
it is however naive to assume that we will manage to banish smoking altogether
the european parliament has political responsibility in this respect and we do not need to wait for legal procedures
this would be a first we have never done this before and there is always something being drawn up somewhere
moreover the legal offices of the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the correctness of the legal basis
secondly i would like to touch upon health
first of all i am in favour of excluding yields from the packets which seems to have a misleading effect
it is sufficient to indicate that these products are in the packets and that they are harmful to health
people should however be able to gain easy and free access to product information
it is also important to point out the dangers of passive smoking
so far these have been underestimated but the serious effects are becoming increasingly clear
with regard to subsidies i am in favour of phasing these out
this is why i am in favour of scrapping the ban on snuff
concerning warnings the rules of the importing countries could prevail
it would be a useless exercise if the same tests were to be carried out in all the member states in accordance with uniform testing methods
finally mr president i would like to point out the difference between cigarettes pipes and cigars
cigar and pipe smokers are older less frequent smokers in the main and are mainly social smokers
the product concerned is also more expensive
if we mainly wish to discourage people from taking up smoking at a young age this is not the target group
hence the distinction drawn
and that is what counts
another delicate point is the granting of the derogation to greece to allow it to continue to produce strong cigarettes up until 
this is not however the case
this is not the future we want for our own children
let us also give a thought to other people s future
all these provisions however still fall short of what is necessary in the way of consumer information and too often the determination to reach a compromise has prevailed
we must not let the text be distorted by amendments direct from the headquarters of the tobacco industry
we must remain vigilant as to the content size and presentation of these warnings which must not be changed
several contentious issues still remain
the labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions
the maximum tar content of  mg is still excessive and does not take into consideration the real amount actually inhaled and the habits acquired
tar content must be limited still further
more worrying is the fact that the technical committee set up includes specialists from the tobacco industry
the problem has been raised albeit indirectly of reducing and abolishing production aids for tobacco
and it will upset them retroactively
what sort of law school did the people who approve such arbitrary reversals attend
i should be most interested to hear the commission s comments on this
multinationals are already doing just that
obviously the rest will follow with huge repercussions on economic activity and employment within the european union
but instead of focusing on serious matters we prefer a simple or rather a highly simplistic and ineffectual solution
is harmonising these warnings a credible step when these toxic products are free to be distributed throughout the european union with the authorisation of the union
i refuse to believe that in harmonising the warnings and labels the european union simply wishes to act for the common good
as we all know warnings serve no purpose whether or not they are written in helvetica typeface
even if smokers have freedom of choice we still have a duty to take preventative action mainly with regard to younger generations
calendar of partsessions for 
manufacture presentation and sale of tobacco products continuation
the matter has been referred to the court of justice of the european communities
the rapporteur from the committee on legal affairs and the internal market suggests kicking the ball into touch by referring the debate back
whatever the case we are required to examine the content of the report before us
regarding the content of the report then an accurate observation is made and the rapporteur makes some sensible proposals but in the final analysis the sideways shift sets in
of course many more people die too
on the basis of these facts then some sensible proposals have been made
tar content must be limited to  mg per cigarette and nicotine content to  mg per cigarette
these are intelligent and reasonable suggestions
there are also plans to provide information on the dangers of tobacco and to protect children and even the infants at risk from sudden infant death syndrome
this however is the start of the sideslip into lack of realism selfrighteousness and fundamentalism
in other words from an accurate observation and reasonable proposals we move towards a problem that is even worse than tobacco itself
what is this sideways shift
in the first place there is the bureaucratic sideslip with the business of the label
we are putting labels on everything
indeed the ecologist s neurosis is revealed by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised
we have labels on meat wine gm products chocolate
it is the trump card that beats any freedoms
and now labels on tobacco but mark you for labelling tobacco we are talking serious business
the labels must feature text but not just any old text it must be printed in black helvetica bold type  intensity
thus proving that tobacco affects not only the lungs but also the brain
this is clearly not however a sensible measure
let me give one example tobacco was introduced into europe at the same time as the potato
what does that prove
this is the sideslip into selfrighteousness and hypocrisy
we are told that there are social costs
yet the smoker pays excise duties of between  and  included in the price of tobacco
in my own country revenue from excise duties is greater than that from recording rights
in other words by smoking the smoker is paying for the cost of his own cancer treatment
people have said that it is inconsistent to allocate a billion to tobacco farming and then pay out for the campaign against tobacco
then there is the puritanical sideslip
the rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations social instincts
what i hear is the social democratic sweden of the s sterilising fifteen year old adolescents because they were social misfits
i hear moral order the salem witches
it is the same puritanical streak shared by robespierre pol pot the greens and the quakers
our rapporteur is a liberal and should not forget the lessons of laissezfaire liberalism let them live let them be born let them drink and let them smoke
it is only totalitarian regimes that attempt to regulate the happiness of their citizens
what are we to think of this crude misuse of articles  and 
what are we to think of the rejection voted by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
what then will be the use of this committee and indeed of the european union s legal consultants
this affects one million jobs in europe
in france   small producers are scraping a living thanks to this additional activity which is extremely labourintensive
as you will have understood we shall be voting against this directive
is it too much to ask that articles  and  be respected
all we are asking for is a minimum of subsidiarity and a modicum of tolerance
there have been a large number of amendments including the one tabled by myself attempting to defend the production sector and the tobaccogrowing sector in particular
this is a major industry which moreover hires more women than men to do seasonal work
we are concerned as to whether this instrument will genuinely be an effective means of reducing tobacco consumption
this leads me to advocate delaying the date when these new provisions come into force
in these circumstances jeopardising the situation of european producers would only be of benefit to the multinationals involved in import and export
i should not like to think that this might be our objective
tobacco is no ordinary product of course
we are familiar with the fatal risks associated with tobacco we know the statistics which have already been quoted here today
we also know about its addictive effect
typical use of cigarettes is extremely dangerous lifethreateningly so
i very much welcome the emphasis which mr maaten placed on the dangers of passive smoking
a tobacco ban would be inefficient and socially unattainable at present
but it still remains clear that those who market cigarettes should not be allowed to do so
the product is far too dangerous
what can we do as regulators
we should be able to admit to this
european policy on tobacco is not very logical to say the least
i should like briefly to mention the matter of the potential unemployment created by this directive
jobs in the industry have been rationalised by 
employment levels in tobacco production which formerly stood at   people now involves no more than   people
it is therefore not true that the directive will cause job losses
the production and consumption of tobacco increased dramatically in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
it was then thought that smoking was normal and that any selfrespecting man should light up a cigarette
tobacco generates big bucks
this is why there are stakeholders who would prefer to continue to keep everything as free as possible within this market
freedom of production import and advertising and freedom to mislead and sponsor events which attract large crowds of people
nonsmokers run risks too because they are obliged to inhale the smoke of those smoking around them
accordingly tobacco is not just about economic interests rather it is far more of a public health problem
this is not about one case in isolation but about the responsibility of all of us together
we cannot leave the market free and subsequently blame the victims of smoking for their bad health
this is not how we treat consumers of heroin or cocaine
it is necessary to ensure that tobacco products are hard to come by and to warn the rest of the users about the risks as best we can
the norm should be that smoking is abnormal and that new generations must be protected from this addiction
from the public health point of view it is necessary that we no longer take the interests of tobacco producers and sellers into account
in addition it should not be possible for people to buy cigarettes at supermarkets cafes or petrol stations as an afterthought
some opponents of the currently proposed measures blame the rapporteur for making outrageous proposals
i believe it has to precede it

it is in effect all part of the realisation throughout the world that smoking is harmful and we have the figures to prove it
having established that we can then discuss any other justifications we may wish to
i feel that the main point to be stressed is the need to create a nonsmoking culture
last century smoking was part of the culture it was important and provided a sense of security
now however we have to turn that culture on its head
on the other hand i also have to consider the   workers and the   or so tobacco growers of the tobacco industry
mr president smoking forms a serious threat to public health
in the european union more than half a million people die each year as a result of smoking
due to the addictive effect it appears very difficult to stop smoking
unfortunately it is still the case that many young people take up smoking
once the tobacco industry has won over a young person the industry is generally guaranteed another regular customer
the european commission s proposal and mr maaten s excellent report adequately address the abovementioned problems
i do however have two further remarks to make
firstly european tobacco policy is not consistent a point which has already been argued
it is high time that these subsidies were phased out gradually down to zero
my second comment concerns labelling i am in favour of strict labelling ie  or  of the packaging for health warnings is a workable compromise
as for the content of the warnings i think that the text als u rookt bent u uzelf aan het doden if you smoke you are killing yourself has just crossed the boundary of what is reasonable
warnings should appeal to the smokers own perception of the environment and should not be formulated such that their effect is like water off a duck s back
i am sorry to see that over the years there has been no development in their arguments
i regret this all the more because now even the cigarette industry itself is tending to acknowledge the fact that this debate should be obsolete
those who are now hypocritically rehashing yesterday s legal arguments are taking part in an outmoded rearguard debate
every year tobacco kills more people
how is it possible not to shudder when thinking of our young people our young women and our young mothers
on the specific subject of agricultural subsidies in favour of tobacco production i should like to see the european union at long last adopting a consistent policy
for years the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy has been denouncing these budget decisions
in terms of the common agricultural policy new plans must be thought up with a view to finding alternative solutions for farmers
as a socialist member and spokesperson in the legal affairs committee i would like to reiterate the objection to this point of view
this directive which we are discussing today has nothing to do with the directive on tobacco advertising
yet when it comes to the greatest killer drug of all we apply different rules
there is no consistency and we say that people should be allowed to choose for themselves
as a liberal i agree with that position people should be allowed to choose for themselves
however everything possible must be done to ensure that those decisions are made with full knowledge of the consequences
frankly the manufacturers have an addiction of their own an addiction to trying to mislead us
and we should accept that fact advertising does work
we should seek to turn the tables on them
we should seek to ensure that the cigarette packs themselves are turned into instruments to promote health not death
we should follow the canadian example and ensure that advertising is used effectively
and the bigger the better
the tiny label of  which we have at present is not effective then
we need warnings which are much bigger
but  of new smokers are young people under the age of 
the traditional warning that smoking harms your health cuts no ice with them
i would like to add one other point
fellow meps i would like to call on you to back jules maaten s excellent report
most of it is imported
consequently measures to reduce tobacco production will do nothing to reduce consumption they will merely boost imports
it would be absurd to maintain that people from countries outside the european union have greater resistance to harmful substances
the protection of the general public health of the citizens of the union must be a central priority for all european union legislators at any time
let us use it intelligently
descriptions such as low tar mild and light must in future be banned
such slick advertising by tobacco manufacturers must not be permitted
the truth is that people inhale more deeply to get the taste and so can actually damage themselves more
such labels are deceptive and dangerous and should be banned
the export issue is probably the most difficult
lastly we have the issue of subsidies for growing tobacco paid by our taxpayers to people in our europe
our governments must stop this and we must stop them supporting it
the division in the environment committee was overcome as the major groups managed to agree a compromise
on behalf of the socialist group we support this compromise
we reject the view that the legal basis of the report is wrong
we support the creation within the eu of a single market in cigarette and tobacco products
we believe that health warnings should be bolder clearer and larger
nevertheless my concern is that in some areas our good intentions are in advance of common sense
